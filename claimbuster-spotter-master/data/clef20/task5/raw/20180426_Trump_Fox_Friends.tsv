1	Ainsley Earhardt	Well, here's the presidential seal.
2	Ainsley Earhardt	There is the White House and inside the White House is the President of the United States, Donald Trump.
3	Brian Kilmeade	And why would you be bringing that up, Ainsley?
4	Ainsley Earhardt	He joins us now by phone.
5	Ainsley Earhardt	Thank you so much for being with us, Mr. President.
6	Donald Trump	Well, good morning, and I picked a very, very special day because it's Melania's birthday, so I said let's do it on Melania's birthday.
7	Donald Trump	So, happy birthday to Melania.
8	Brian Kilmeade	All right.
9	Brian Kilmeade	Hopefully, they'll be visits in between but have you decided on or do you want to tell us what you got her?
10	Donald Trump	Well, I better not get into that because I may get in trouble.
11	Donald Trump	Maybe I didn't get her so much.
12	Donald Trump	I'll tell you what.
13	Donald Trump	She has done -- a got her a beautiful card.
14	Donald Trump	You know, I'm very busy --
15	Brian Kilmeade	At this point --
16	Donald Trump	-- to be running out looking for presents, OK?
17	Donald Trump	But I got her a beautiful card and some beautiful flowers.
18	Donald Trump	And she did a fantastic job with France.
19	Donald Trump	I'll tell you what, the people of France are just -- were spellbound by what happened with their great president who just left, Emmanuel, and he is a wonderful guy and --
20	Steve Doocy	You guys really got along great.
21	Donald Trump	-- with a wonderful wife.
22	Donald Trump	Well, we did and --
23	Steve Doocy	You guys got along great.
24	Donald Trump	We did and, you know, they are both terrific people.
25	Donald Trump	And, Brigitte -- and we had a fantastic time.
26	Donald Trump	And much more importantly, we accomplished a lot.
27	Donald Trump	We really accomplished a lot.
28	Donald Trump	More than anybody knows.
29	Donald Trump	You'll be seeing what we accomplished.
30	Steve Doocy	Well, give us a hint.
31	Steve Doocy	Give us a hint.
32	Donald Trump	Well, I think we really came to recognize the -- you know, I can say it from my standpoint but he is viewing, I believe, Iran a lot differently than he did before he walked into the Oval Office and I think that's important.
33	Donald Trump	He understands where I'm coming from with respect to Iran.
34	Donald Trump	Iran is a real problem for this country.
35	Donald Trump	The president made a horrible deal.
36	Donald Trump	When I say the president, I'm talking about past administration made a horrible deal giving $150 billion, giving $1.8 billion in cash -- in actual cash carried out in barrels and in boxes from airplanes.
37	Donald Trump	It's inconceivable -- $1.8 billion.
38	Donald Trump	And all they do is scream death to America, death to America.
39	Donald Trump	And by the way, they're not screaming it so much anymore.
40	Donald Trump	They were screaming it with him.
41	Donald Trump	They don't scream it with me.
42	Donald Trump	We haven't seen their little boats circling our ships in the ocean lately because they know if they do circle the ships they're not going to be there very longer.
43	Brian Kilmeade	All right, I want to come back to that a little later because we do want to see if that -- because you have a big deadline coming up with the Iranian agreement.
44	Donald Trump	I do.
45	Brian Kilmeade	But --
46	Donald Trump	I do.
47	Brian Kilmeade	-- when it comes to Ronny --
48	Steve Doocy	Your call.
49	Brian Kilmeade	-- Jackson, the word came out from John Roberts --
50	Donald Trump	Yes.
51	Brian Kilmeade	-- now confirmed that he is no longer going to be a candidate to lead the V.A.
52	Brian Kilmeade	In his statement is this.
53	Brian Kilmeade	The allegations against me are completely false and fabricated.
54	Brian Kilmeade	If they had any merit, I would not have been selected, promoted, and trusted to serve in such a sensitive and important role as physician to three presidents over 12 years.
55	Brian Kilmeade	In my role as a doctor, I have tirelessly worked to provide excellent care for all my patients.
56	Brian Kilmeade	In doing so, I have always adhered to the highest ethical standards.
57	Brian Kilmeade	Last night the report was you had a huddle.
58	Brian Kilmeade	Is that what you decided last night?
59	Brian Kilmeade	Is that what all of you decided?
60	Donald Trump	Well, I even told him a day or two ago.
61	Donald Trump	I saw where this was going.
62	Donald Trump	And, you know, they're very upset because Mike Pompeo who was again, first in his class at West Point, top in his class at Harvard Law School.
63	Donald Trump	A brilliant guy, a great guy, and somebody I get along with very well.
64	Donald Trump	You know, Mike got through and they thought they had him stopped.
65	Donald Trump	The Democrats are obstructionists.
66	Donald Trump	It's horrible what they're doing.
67	Donald Trump	They're not approving people.
68	Donald Trump	They're taking them out to the maximum 30 hours.
69	Donald Trump	That's a lot of time -- 30 hours -- to interview people that are going to be approved.
70	Donald Trump	I mean, they go 30 hours and then people will vote, and it's a disgrace.
71	Donald Trump	In fact, they had a report the other day that at this rate it will be nine years before --
72	Steve Doocy	It's unbelievable.
73	Donald Trump	-- they're allowed to come into government.
74	Donald Trump	So you have that have given up everything.
75	Donald Trump	They've given up their jobs.
76	Donald Trump	Top-line people -- brilliant people.
77	Donald Trump	They want to come in and help us in government and Chuck Schumer and the group take, you know, years to approve them -- years.
78	Donald Trump	We have judges that are waiting.
79	Donald Trump	Top of the line people.
80	Donald Trump	The best people in our country and --
81	Donald Trump	And by the way, they're going to be approved but they take them out until the very, very end.
82	Donald Trump	And they said over nine years before they get approved --
83	Brian Kilmeade	Mr. President --
84	Donald Trump	-- because they're using every little trick in the book.
85	Brian Kilmeade	-- Mitch McConnell could keep them seven days a week until they reach their 30 hours and make them, these men and women, stay until this gets done.
86	Brian Kilmeade	Why won't he do that?
87	Donald Trump	Well, he should be doing that and I think he will be doing that.
88	Donald Trump	And he should be doing that.
89	Donald Trump	Honestly, the Republicans -- look, we have some absolute warriors.
90	Donald Trump	We have -- when I -- I just watched your show.
91	Donald Trump	Jim Jordan, and Mark Meadows, and Matt Gaetz, and DeSantis, and so many -- Corey Lewandowski.
92	Donald Trump	We have people -- Diamond and Silk are warriors, by the way.
93	Donald Trump	How about Diamond and Silk?
94	Donald Trump	They've become amazing.
95	Donald Trump	You know, that started off like somebody was talking about them on the Internet.
96	Donald Trump	They were these two women -- these two beautiful, wonderful, women.
97	Donald Trump	And I said well, let me check it out.
98	Donald Trump	It took me about two seconds to say start them -- it's incredible.
99	Donald Trump	So, Diamond and Silk, these are all warriors.
100	Donald Trump	We have great people in the Republican Party and I think that, in one way, it's showing how bad, how obstructionist these Democrats are.
101	Donald Trump	It's a disgrace what's happening.
102	Ainsley Earhardt	Do you think the obstructionist window -- as Dr. Jackson says, these allegations are baseless and they're just attacking him?
103	Ainsley Earhardt	This is not true, he served our country but yet, he's still withdrawing his name.
104	Ainsley Earhardt	So does the obstructionist win when your nominees don't fight back?
105	Donald Trump	Well, I could say yes.
106	Donald Trump	I can also say no because Doc Ronny -- you know, we call him Doc Ronny, we call him Admiral Ronny.
107	Donald Trump	He's an admiral, highly respected, a real leader.
108	Donald Trump	And I watched what Jon Tester of Montana, a state that I won by like over 20 points.
109	Donald Trump	You know, really, they love me and I love them.
110	Donald Trump	And I want to tell you that Jon Tester -- I think this is going to cause him a lot of problems in his state.
111	Donald Trump	He took a man who was just an incredible man -- an incredible man respected by President Obama.
112	Donald Trump	He gave him his highest rating.
113	Donald Trump	You saw what President Obama said.
114	Steve Doocy	Yes.
115	Donald Trump	President Bush -- he was the doctor to President Bush, to President Obama and the family.
116	Donald Trump	He's been my doctor.
117	Donald Trump	And he runs a fantastic operation.
118	Donald Trump	You know, they have many doctors and they run a fantastic operation.
119	Donald Trump	And honestly, I said it to him.
120	Donald Trump	He didn't come to me.
121	Donald Trump	I said, you know, Doc, you run a great operation.
122	Donald Trump	How do you think you'd do at the V.A.
123	Donald Trump	?
124	Donald Trump	Now, we can talk about experience but the V.A.
125	Donald Trump	-- when you think about 13 million people --
126	Steve Doocy	Sure.
127	Donald Trump	-- you could take the head of the biggest hospital corporation of the world and it's peanuts compared to the V.A., so nobody has experience, you know.
128	Donald Trump	It's a big monster.
129	Donald Trump	And I'm really proud of the job we've done for the V.A.
130	Donald Trump	because we got -- we're working right now on Choice and really big -- but we got rid of so many rules and regulations that made it impossible and we're really doing great at the V.A.
131	Steve Doocy	Right.
132	Donald Trump	But I want somebody that's going to be great.
133	Donald Trump	He would've done a great job --
134	Steve Doocy	Did --
135	Donald Trump	He's got a tremendous heart.
136	Steve Doocy	Any idea who you might --
137	Donald Trump	You know, these are all false accusations that were made.
138	Donald Trump	These are false and they're trying to destroy a man.
139	Donald Trump	By the way, I did say welcome to Washington.
140	Donald Trump	Welcome to the swamp.
141	Donald Trump	Welcome to the world of politics.
142	Brian Kilmeade	Sure.
143	Donald Trump	But for Jon Tester to start bringing up stuff like candy man and the kind of things he was saying, and then say well, you know, these are just statements that are made.
144	Steve Doocy	Right.
145	Donald Trump	There's no proof of this.
146	Donald Trump	And he has a perfect record.
147	Donald Trump	He's got this beautiful record unblemished.
148	Donald Trump	His son is a wonderful boy.
149	Donald Trump	Goes to Annapolis, at the top of his class.
150	Donald Trump	One of the finest cadets.
151	Donald Trump	For him to be doing this to this man and this family, I think Jon Tester has to have a big price to pay in Montana because I don't think people in Montana -- the admiral is the kind of person that they respect and admire and they don't like seeing what's happened to him.
152	Steve Doocy	Well, the admiral has officially thrown in the towel.
153	Steve Doocy	Any idea who you might nominate next?
154	Donald Trump	I do, actually, but I better not give it.
155	Donald Trump	Maybe we'll do it on my next call.
156	Donald Trump	I do -- I think we're going to have somebody great.
157	Steve Doocy	All right.
158	Donald Trump	Somebody that's more -- you know, look, the admiral is not a politician which is what I liked, by the way.
159	Steve Doocy	Is your nominee somebody in politics right now?
160	Donald Trump	Somebody with political capability, yes.
161	Steve Doocy	All right.
162	Steve Doocy	Meanwhile, let's talk a little bit about your former FBI director James Comey, who you fired.
163	Donald Trump	Right.
164	Steve Doocy	He was on T.V.
165	Steve Doocy	last night.
166	Steve Doocy	He said --
167	Donald Trump	I did a great thing for the American people by firing him.
168	Steve Doocy	Well, he says he's not a leaker.
169	Steve Doocy	He disputed what Anderson Cooper had said.
170	Steve Doocy	But what's interesting is we've learned through Catherine Herridge's reporting is that apparently the guy he gave the secret memos to, Dr. Richman at Columbia University -- he had this special government employee status where he had -- you know, he could look at secrets.
171	Steve Doocy	He had a badge to the building.
172	Steve Doocy	And also, apparently, the memos were leaked to a wider group of people or at least two, maybe three, including former U.S. attorney Patrick Fitzgerald.
173	Steve Doocy	Your opinion on what Mr. Comey is doing on his book tour and the fact that he had a special friend at Columbia University with an FBI badge.
174	Donald Trump	Look, Comey is a leaker and he's a liar and not only on this stuff.
175	Donald Trump	He's been leaking for years.
176	Donald Trump	He's probably been using his friend, the so-called professor who now turns out to have FBI clearance, which he never said.
177	Donald Trump	He even lied about that because he never said that in Congress.
178	Donald Trump	He said he gave it to a friend and he gave it to a friend to leak classified information.
179	Donald Trump	It's all classified.
180	Donald Trump	It was totally classified.
181	Donald Trump	So illegally -- he did an illegal act and he said it himself in order to get a special counsel against me.
182	Donald Trump	So the special counsel -- and by the way, and Intelligence Committee and everybody else has found no collusion.
183	Donald Trump	There's no collusion with me and the Russians.
184	Donald Trump	Nobody's been tougher to Russia --
185	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
186	Donald Trump	-- than I am.
187	Donald Trump	You can ask President Putin about that.
188	Donald Trump	There's been nobody.
189	Donald Trump	Between the military and the oil and all of the other things that I've done -- the aluminum tax.
190	Donald Trump	They send us a lot of aluminum and I put tariffs on aluminum coming in.
191	Donald Trump	The 60 people that we sent out -- the 60 so-called diplomats.
192	Donald Trump	Nobody's been tougher.
193	Donald Trump	Nobody's even been close to as tough as me and we hear this nonsense.
194	Donald Trump	So there's no collusion whatsoever.
195	Donald Trump	Well, Comey -- what he did, Brian, was terrible.
196	Donald Trump	He leaked classified information in order to try and get a special counsel --
197	Steve Doocy	He says it wasn't classified, Mr. President.
198	Steve Doocy	He says it wasn't classified.
199	Donald Trump	Oh, it's -- well, it's totally classified.
200	Donald Trump	And he also leaked the memos which are classified.
201	Donald Trump	Nobody unclassified them.
202	Donald Trump	And those memos were about me and they're phony memos.
203	Donald Trump	He didn't write those memos accurately.
204	Donald Trump	He put a lot of phony stuff.
205	Donald Trump	For instance, I went to Russia for a day or so -- a day or two because I own the Miss Universe pageant.
206	Donald Trump	So, I went there to watch it because it was near Moscow.
207	Donald Trump	So I go to Russia -- now, I did go there -- everybody knows.
208	Donald Trump	The locks are there, the planes are there.
209	Donald Trump	He said I didn't stay there a night.
210	Donald Trump	Of course, I stayed there.
211	Donald Trump	I stayed there a very short period of time but, of course, I stayed.
212	Donald Trump	Well, his memo said I left immediately.
213	Donald Trump	I never said that.
214	Donald Trump	I never said I left immediately.
215	Donald Trump	So he said -- and you know, the funny thing, he does these memos and then fake news CNN who's a total fake -- you know, they give Hillary Clinton the questions to the debate and nobody -- can you imagine, by the way, if you gave me the questions to a debate?
216	Donald Trump	They would have you out of business --
217	Brian Kilmeade	Yes.
218	Donald Trump	-- and they'd have me -- you better get out of this campaign.
219	Donald Trump	They don't even bring it up.
220	Donald Trump	I mean, CNN - fake news CNN actually gave the questions to the --
221	Brian Kilmeade	Yes, but don't worry about them.
222	Ainsley Earhardt	I want to ask you --
223	Donald Trump	No, no -- no, no, but think of it.
224	Donald Trump	How bad is that?
225	Donald Trump	So anyway -- so Comey leaked and, by the way, also what he did with CNN in order to placate them, you saw that whole scenario.
226	Donald Trump	This is a big mistake, this book.
227	Donald Trump	He is guilty of crimes and if we had a Justice Department that was doing their job instead of spending $8 million trying to find --
228	Steve Doocy	It's your Justice Department.
229	Steve Doocy	Mr. President -- Mr. President, you're the Republican in charge --
230	Donald Trump	You're right, yes, you're right.
231	Steve Doocy	You've got a Republican running it.
232	Donald Trump	But here's what -- I answer this all the time.
233	Donald Trump	Because of the fact that they have this witch hunt going on with people in the Justice Department that shouldn't be there -- they have a witch hunt against the President of the United States going on -- I've taken the position -- and I don't have to take this position and maybe I'll change -- that I will not be involved with the Justice Department.
234	Donald Trump	I will wait until this is over.
235	Donald Trump	It's a total -- it's all lies and it's a horrible thing that's going on.
236	Brian Kilmeade	Yes.
237	Donald Trump	A horrible thing and yet, I've accomplished, with all of this going on, more than any president in the first year in our history.
238	Donald Trump	And everybody --
239	Steve Doocy	OK.
240	Donald Trump	Even the enemies and the haters admit that.
241	Ainsley Earhardt	Right.
242	Donald Trump	We have accomplished more than any president in the first year, by far.
243	Donald Trump	If you look at regulations, and the big tax cuts, and Judge Gorsuch -- so many things -- and many other judges.
244	Donald Trump	But the big thing -- the tax cuts, the regulations -- nobody's done what we've done -- what I've done despite what's going on.
245	Donald Trump	So I'm very disappointed in my Justice Department but because of the fact that it's going under, and I think you'll understand this, I have decided that I won't be involved.
246	Donald Trump	I may change my mind at some point because what's going on is a disgrace.
247	Donald Trump	It's an absolute --
248	Brian Kilmeade	All right.
249	Donald Trump	-- disgrace.
250	Donald Trump	And by the way, the only collusion is the collusion with the Democrats and the Russians.
251	Donald Trump	You take a look at what's going on there.
252	Donald Trump	They wouldn't even give their server -- the DNC, Democratic National Committee, wouldn't even give its server to the FBI.
253	Donald Trump	So what kind of an FBI -- they break down doors for Paul Manafort early in the morning.
254	Donald Trump	His wife is in bed like at five or six in the morning.
255	Donald Trump	And they undo the lock for Michael Cohen early in the morning.
256	Donald Trump	And yet, they walk into the DNC and they won't give them the server.
257	Donald Trump	They said we're not giving you the server.
258	Donald Trump	Oh, OK, we'll leave.
259	Donald Trump	That's not the FBI.
260	Donald Trump	That's a fix.
261	Brian Kilmeade	Let's talk about Michael Cohen.
262	Brian Kilmeade	Yesterday, through his attorney, he's going to be taking the Fifth.
263	Brian Kilmeade	What's your reaction to that being that you worked with him for a couple of decades --
264	Donald Trump	I did.
265	Donald Trump	He --
266	Brian Kilmeade	-- as your attorney.
267	Donald Trump	He's a good person.
268	Donald Trump	He's a great guy.
269	Brian Kilmeade	What's at stake for you, Mr. President?
270	Donald Trump	Brian, you know Michael.
271	Donald Trump	Michael's been on your show, I'm sure, a lot.
272	Donald Trump	You know, Michael --
273	Brian Kilmeade	We know.
274	Donald Trump	-- is a good person.
275	Donald Trump	Let me just tell you that Michael is in business.
276	Donald Trump	He's really a businessman at fairly big businesses, I understand.
277	Donald Trump	And I don't know his business but this doesn't have to do with me.
278	Donald Trump	Michael is a businessman.
279	Donald Trump	He's got a business.
280	Donald Trump	He also practices law.
281	Donald Trump	I would say probably the big thing is his business and they're looking at something having to do with his business.
282	Donald Trump	I have nothing to do with his business.
283	Donald Trump	I can tell you he's a good guy.
284	Donald Trump	He sometimes --
285	Brian Kilmeade	But isn't your business -- isn't his business your attorney, Mr. President?
286	Donald Trump	I have many, many -- just so you understand, I have many attorneys.
287	Donald Trump	I have attorneys -- sadly, I have so many attorneys you wouldn't even believe it.
288	Steve Doocy	How many -- how much of your -- Mr. President, how much of your legal work was handled by Michael Cohen?
289	Donald Trump	Well, he has a percentage of my overall legal work -- a tiny, tiny little fraction.
290	Donald Trump	But, Michael would represent me and represent me on some things.
291	Donald Trump	He represents me -- like with this crazy Stormy Daniels deal he represented me.
292	Donald Trump	And, you know, from what I see he did absolutely nothing wrong.
293	Donald Trump	There were no campaign funds going into this --
294	Ainsley Earhardt	Then why is he pleading the Fifth?
295	Donald Trump	-- which would have been a problem.
296	Donald Trump	Because he's got other things.
297	Donald Trump	He's got businesses and from what I understand they're looking at his businesses, and I hope he's in great shape.
298	Brian Kilmeade	Yes.
299	Donald Trump	But he's got businesses and his lawyers probably told him to do that.
300	Donald Trump	But I'm not involved and I'm not involved -- and I've been told I'm not involved.
301	Brian Kilmeade	Right, Mr. --
302	Ainsley Earhardt	Right.
303	Donald Trump	That just came out of the newspapers.
304	Ainsley Earhardt	Mr. President --
305	Donald Trump	I've been told I'm not involved in that.
306	Ainsley Earhardt	We want to get to Kanye West.
307	Ainsley Earhardt	He tweeted that he loves you, that you're his brother, and --
308	Donald Trump	He's got good taste.
309	Ainsley Earhardt	-- the left goes ballistic.
310	Ainsley Earhardt	What's your reaction?
311	Donald Trump	Yes.
312	Donald Trump	Well, they do.
313	Donald Trump	You know, I have known Kanye a little bit and I get along with Kanye.
314	Donald Trump	I get along with a lot of people, frankly.
315	Donald Trump	But Kanye looks and he sees black unemployment at the lowest it's been in the history of our country, OK?
316	Donald Trump	He sees Hispanic unemployment at the lowest it's been in the history of our country.
317	Donald Trump	He sees, by the way, female unemployment -- women unemployment the lowest it's been in now almost 19 years.
318	Donald Trump	He sees that stuff and he's smart.
319	Donald Trump	And he says you know what, Trump is doing a much better job than the Democrats did.
320	Donald Trump	And by the way, if they ever got in and started putting back all these rules and regulations where you can't breathe, where businesses go out of business, our country would be in big trouble.
321	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
322	Donald Trump	And had I not gotten elected, Hillary would have come in.
323	Donald Trump	She would have added more rules and regulations.
324	Donald Trump	We would have been out of business because you saw what was happening.
325	Donald Trump	We were going down.
326	Brian Kilmeade	Yes, and a couple of things on top of that.
327	Brian Kilmeade	There's a bigger picture.
328	Brian Kilmeade	Kanye West comes out.
329	Brian Kilmeade	Regardless of what he says he doesn't have anything personally against you.
330	Brian Kilmeade	He likes you even if he doesn't agree with everything.
331	Brian Kilmeade	Then he has other people in the black community.
332	Brian Kilmeade	Like, Chance the Rapper comes out and says black people don't have to be Democrats.
333	Brian Kilmeade	Have Republicans done a bad job ignoring the black community up until now?
334	Donald Trump	You know, I think it was just a custom.
335	Donald Trump	People don't realize, you know, if you go back to the Civil War it was the Republicans that really did the thing.
336	Donald Trump	Lincoln was a Republican.
337	Donald Trump	I mean, somehow it changed over the years and I will say I really believe it's changing back.
338	Donald Trump	Remember, I was going to get no black votes?
339	Steve Doocy	Right.
340	Donald Trump	I was going to get none?
341	Donald Trump	Well, I got a lot.
342	Donald Trump	I got a lot of support, you know, and I should have gotten much more.
343	Donald Trump	Now -- in fact, I used to go around saying what do you have to lose?
344	Donald Trump	I'd say that at speeches, remember?
345	Donald Trump	I'd go into a stadium.
346	Donald Trump	I'd talk about the African-American vote.
347	Donald Trump	I said the education is not good.
348	Donald Trump	The -- obviously, the law enforcement that your community -- the crime is at levels that nobody's ever seen before.
349	Donald Trump	You know, I'd go through like seven, 10 stats.
350	Donald Trump	I'd say vote for me.
351	Donald Trump	What do you have to lose?
352	Steve Doocy	Right.
353	Donald Trump	So now they've voted for me crime is way down and really importantly, the unemployment picture --
354	Steve Doocy	Yes.
355	Donald Trump	-- is the best it's been in the history of our country for African-Americans.
356	Steve Doocy	Mr. President, what does it say though about the political discourse in this country that when somebody comes out and says I like Donald Trump, suddenly the political left goes out and destroys them?
357	Steve Doocy	Shania Twain was asked a couple of days ago about well, if you could've voted for Donald Trump would you have?
358	Steve Doocy	And she said yes, I would have.
359	Steve Doocy	And then she got so destroyed online she had to come out and apologize.
360	Steve Doocy	And then yesterday, the same thing with Kanye West.
361	Steve Doocy	Suddenly, people are saying the guy's out of his mind because he supports you.
362	Steve Doocy	What happened to being able to have a different point of view?
363	Donald Trump	All right, I'll tell you what happened.
364	Donald Trump	Shania, who I think is terrific but she made a mistake by sort of saying I wish I didn't, you know, go public with it, but we know how she feels.
365	Donald Trump	But people have done that and they're amazed at what happens to their business because we have tremendous support.
366	Donald Trump	We have tremendous fans.
367	Donald Trump	If I ever called for a rally in Washington, D.C. we'd have millions of people coming into Washington because they love what's happening.
368	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
369	Donald Trump	So when I see a Kanye sticking to his guns or when I see others, and there are plenty of others, sticking to their guns and coming out and saying that you have a young lady who's been very much in the news in the last three or four days --
370	Brian Kilmeade	Candace Owens.
371	Donald Trump	-- because she is -- she is fantastic.
372	Donald Trump	She's like the hottest thing out there now.
373	Donald Trump	If you have people do that they become much more popular.
374	Donald Trump	Remember, we won the election and we won it easily.
375	Donald Trump	You know, a lot of people say oh, it was close.
376	Brian Kilmeade	Yes.
377	Donald Trump	And by the way, they also like to always talk about Electoral College.
378	Donald Trump	Well, it's an election based on the Electoral College.
379	Donald Trump	I would rather have a popular election but it's a totally different campaign.
380	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
381	Donald Trump	It's as though you're running -- if you're a runner you're practicing for the 100-yard dash as opposed to the one-mile.
382	Donald Trump	The Electoral College is different.
383	Donald Trump	I would rather have the popular vote because it's -- to me, it's much easier to win.
384	Brian Kilmeade	Yes, it's a totally different set of goals as opposed to the Electoral College.
385	Donald Trump	Yes, but we have an Electoral College --
386	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
387	Donald Trump	I got 306 and she got what, 223.
388	Donald Trump	So, remember --
389	Brian Kilmeade	Yes.
390	Donald Trump	-- there was no way to break 270.
391	Brian Kilmeade	All right.
392	Donald Trump	I heard that on CBS, and NBC, and ABC.
393	Donald Trump	They're all fake news.
394	Brian Kilmeade	So --
395	Donald Trump	I heard that for so long -- and CNN.
396	Donald Trump	But I heard that for so long.
397	Donald Trump	There is no way.
398	Donald Trump	So what they're trying to do is suppress the vote.
399	Donald Trump	Everyone goes home and says you know, I really like Donald Trump but I've watched on the news -- and they don't know it's fake news.
400	Donald Trump	I've taught them it's fake news.
401	Donald Trump	I've watched on the news that he can't win, so let's go to a movie, darling, and then we'll come home and we'll watch --
402	Brian Kilmeade	And you'll find out in the midterms whether they go with the darling home or they go to the movies.
403	Donald Trump	But I think that --
404	Brian Kilmeade	Let's talk about --
405	Donald Trump	I think he'll do better than people think in the midterms.
406	Brian Kilmeade	Mr. President --
407	Donald Trump	Did you know it's very --
408	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
409	Donald Trump	The economy is so strong and jobs are so good that I think we're going to surprise -- you know, we won an election yesterday in Arizona.
410	Donald Trump	Nobody talks about it.
411	Donald Trump	They had these massive booths set up for CNN and everybody.
412	Donald Trump	They had these big booths set up because they were hoping -- you know, they spent a fortune on the Democrat and the Republican won -- Lesko.
413	Donald Trump	And you know what, nobody talks about it.
414	Brian Kilmeade	All right.
415	Brian Kilmeade	But, Mr. President, you can argue -- you can argue that the midterms are going to be decided on big things like a meeting that you're going to have one-one-one with Kim Jong Un.
416	Brian Kilmeade	How much are you looking at the summit that starts tomorrow with South Korea to look at what you're going to be doing when you sit down with North Korea?
417	Brian Kilmeade	And on top of that, we know this is confidential but can you give us any more information on the one-on-one that Mike Pompeo had with Kim Jong Un?
418	Brian Kilmeade	A lot of people are hungry for some details.
419	Donald Trump	Well, I can.
420	Donald Trump	First of all, we're doing very well with North Korea and we'll see how it all comes out.
421	Donald Trump	Again, Brian, I'm not like Obama where you go in and you have a Kerry, who's the worst negotiator I've ever seen.
422	Donald Trump	He goes in for the Iran deal, he never leaves.
423	Donald Trump	He should've left.
424	Donald Trump	He should've just left.
425	Donald Trump	He would have -- could have made a much better deal.
426	Donald Trump	But -- so it could be that I walk out quickly -- with respect, but it could be.
427	Donald Trump	It could be that maybe the meeting doesn't even take place.
428	Donald Trump	Who knows?
429	Donald Trump	But I can tell you right now they want to meet.
430	Donald Trump	They wanted to go to the Olympics.
431	Donald Trump	Look, it was very, very nasty with Little Rocket Man and with the buttons -- and, you know, my button's bigger than -- everybody said this guy's going to get us into nuclear war.
432	Donald Trump	Let me tell you.
433	Donald Trump	The nuclear war would have happened if you had weak people.
434	Donald Trump	We had weak people.
435	Donald Trump	This should have been settled long before I came into office.
436	Donald Trump	This is a much different ballgame than if they did it five or 10 or 20 years ago.
437	Donald Trump	This is a much more dangerous ballgame now.
438	Donald Trump	But I will tell you it's going very well.
439	Donald Trump	Mike Pompeo did go there.
440	Donald Trump	He wasn't supposed to meet with Kim Jong Un but he did.
441	Donald Trump	He -- you know, they arranged, actually while he was there, to say hello.
442	Donald Trump	We have incredible pictures of the two talking and meeting which I'd love to release.
443	Donald Trump	If we can I'll do that, actually.
444	Donald Trump	It's not a bad idea.
445	Brian Kilmeade	So it was just a hello, Mr. President?
446	Donald Trump	No, it was more than a hello.
447	Donald Trump	They got along.
448	Donald Trump	They were with each other for, you know, more than an hour.
449	Steve Doocy	Right.
450	Donald Trump	They spoke and he also spoke with his counterparts in North Korea.
451	Donald Trump	They had a great meeting.
452	Donald Trump	He then left.
453	Donald Trump	It was very, very secret -- very, very quiet.
454	Donald Trump	They had a great meeting -- he left.
455	Donald Trump	And, you know, when I watch -- liked I watched sleepy eyes Chuck Todd the other day saying why is the president giving up so much and North Korea's giving up nothing?
456	Donald Trump	This was at the beginning of Meet the Press, which, I mean, this guy shouldn't even be --
457	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
458	Donald Trump	-- on the show.
459	Donald Trump	So I said to myself well, wait a minute, I'm seeing it just the opposite.
460	Donald Trump	I haven't given up anything.
461	Donald Trump	I haven't even talked about it.
462	Donald Trump	I haven't given up anything.
463	Donald Trump	We're not giving up much.
464	Ainsley Earhardt	When are you going to meet with him?
465	Donald Trump	I'm not giving up much.
466	Donald Trump	They've given up denuclearization, testing, research.
467	Donald Trump	We're going to close different sites.
468	Donald Trump	And I'm saying to myself, wait a minute.
469	Donald Trump	All of these things he's given up and we haven't even really that much asked them because we would have asked them but they gave it before I even asked.
470	Donald Trump	So I have this guy, fake news -- he's on television saying why am I giving up something?
471	Donald Trump	I never gave up anything.
472	Donald Trump	The people have to understand how dishonest the news is.
473	Donald Trump	And in all fairness to Fox, you guys don't always treat me great but you treat me fairly.
474	Donald Trump	You know, it's not like Fox is perfect for me.
475	Donald Trump	They're not -- they're tough but at least it's fair.
476	Donald Trump	When you look at some of the others -- you look at like a CNN, they'll have a council of seven people and of the seven people every one of them is against me.
477	Donald Trump	I'm saying, where do we -- where do they even find these people?
478	Donald Trump	I appreciate the --
479	Brian Kilmeade	I'm not your doctor, Mr. President, but I would -- I would recommend you watch less of them.
480	Donald Trump	I don't watch them at all.
481	Donald Trump	I watched last night.
482	Steve Doocy	Well, that makes it easy.
483	Donald Trump	I'll tell you what.
484	Donald Trump	I watched leaking, lying Comey last night and I did -- I did -- I hated to do it.
485	Donald Trump	You know, one of the reasons people say you're still looking good, Mr. President.
486	Donald Trump	How do you do it?
487	Donald Trump	Well, one of the things I've been able to do, which is something I never thought I had the ability -- I would always watch when I was -- now, frankly, I don't have time for two reasons.
488	Donald Trump	There's too much and I don't have time.
489	Donald Trump	But I would watch -- whether it's good or bad, I'd always watch.
490	Donald Trump	I have an ability -- I don't watch NBC anymore.
491	Donald Trump	They're as bad as CNN.
492	Donald Trump	I don't -- and by the way, I made them a fortune with THE APPRENTICE.
493	Donald Trump	Think of that one.
494	Donald Trump	I made them -- and I did 19 episodes.
495	Steve Doocy	Your alma mater.
496	Donald Trump	No, but I made them a fortune.
497	Steve Doocy	Right.
498	Donald Trump	You would think that these guys would treat me great.
499	Donald Trump	I made them a fortune.
500	Donald Trump	So they treat me horribly --
501	Steve Doocy	OK.
502	Donald Trump	-- and they treat me falsely.
503	Donald Trump	But just one thing.
504	Donald Trump	I don't watch things now.
505	Donald Trump	I can put it out of my mind and I never, ever thought that that would be possible.
506	Donald Trump	And you know what that does?
507	Donald Trump	It keeps you on the ball.
508	Donald Trump	It keeps you -- you keep your sanity and it works very well.
509	Donald Trump	But last night I did watch --
510	Ainsley Earhardt	Mr. President, I have one question.
511	Donald Trump	I did watch a liar-leaker and his performance, by the way, was horrible.
512	Donald Trump	And I will say this.
513	Donald Trump	Anderson Cooper was surprisingly tough and he did a good job.
514	Steve Doocy	He did.
515	Ainsley Earhardt	Mr. President, real quickly, have you decided on a date to meet with Kim Jong Un?
516	Donald Trump	We have a decision to be made.
517	Donald Trump	We have three or four dates and that includes --
518	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
519	Donald Trump	-- locations.
520	Donald Trump	We have five locations --
521	Brian Kilmeade	Great.
522	Donald Trump	-- and that will all be narrowed down.
523	Donald Trump	I can only say this.
524	Donald Trump	When I came into office people thought we were going into nuclear war, OK, and now they're saying wow --
525	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
526	Donald Trump	-- it looks like that's going to be taken care.
527	Steve Doocy	Mr. President --
528	Donald Trump	I think we're doing very well.
529	Donald Trump	Let's see what happens.
530	Steve Doocy	OK. We're running out of time but when we came down after your first month in office and we did that big famous now interview in the East Room --
531	Donald Trump	Right.
532	Steve Doocy	-- Ainsley asked you a question to grade your first month in office.
533	Steve Doocy	Now, fast-forward.
534	Steve Doocy	You've been in office over a year.
535	Steve Doocy	Last year, you said in the first month I give myself an A for effort and a C for messaging because you were having trouble -- the White House was -- explaining what you were doing.
536	Steve Doocy	How would you grade yourself now?
537	Donald Trump	Look, I'm fighting a battle against a horrible group of deep-seated people -- drained the swamp -- that are coming up with all sorts of phony charges against me, and they're not bringing up real charges against the other side.
538	Donald Trump	So we have a phony deal going on and it's a cloud over my head.
539	Donald Trump	And I've been able to do -- to really escape that cloud because the message now everyone knows -- it's a fix, OK.
540	Donald Trump	It's a witch hunt and they know that and I've been able to message it.
541	Donald Trump	I would give myself an A+.
542	Donald Trump	Nobody has done --
543	Steve Doocy	Right.
544	Donald Trump	-- what I've been able to do and I did it despite the fact that I have a phony cloud over my head that doesn't exist.
545	Donald Trump	It was what the Democrats used to try and make an excuse for their loss of an election -- for their loss of the Electoral College that they should never lose because the Electoral College is set up perfectly for the Democrats and this was an absolute total beating in the Electoral College.
546	Donald Trump	They should never lose the Electoral College and they did --
547	Brian Kilmeade	But --
548	Donald Trump	-- and they got thwamped.
549	Brian Kilmeade	But does it make you want to talk to Mueller and put an end to it?
550	Brian Kilmeade	Does it make you want to talk to him because that's what Rudy Giuliani --
551	Donald Trump	Well, if I can.
552	Donald Trump	The problem is that it's such a -- it's such -- if you take a look they're so conflicted.
553	Donald Trump	The people that are doing the investigation -- you have 13 people that are Democrats.
554	Donald Trump	You have Hillary Clinton people.
555	Donald Trump	You have people that worked on Hillary Clinton's foundation.
556	Donald Trump	They're all -- I don't mean Democrats, I mean like the real deal.
557	Donald Trump	And then you look at the phony Lisa Page and Strzok and the memos back and forth, and the FBI.
558	Donald Trump	And by the way, you take a poll at the FBI.
559	Donald Trump	I love the FBI, the FBI loves me.
560	Donald Trump	But the top people in the FBI, headed by Comey, were crooked.
561	Donald Trump	You look at McCabe where he takes $700,000 from somebody supporting Hillary Clinton.
562	Donald Trump	He takes $700,000 for his wife's campaign.
563	Donald Trump	And by the way, didn't even spend that money.
564	Donald Trump	They kept some of it because under that law you're -- he took seven.
565	Donald Trump	He took $700,000 from a group headed by Terry McAuliffe who was under investigation by McCabe and the FBI and that investigation disappeared.
566	Donald Trump	He took $700,000.
567	Donald Trump	And you look at the corruption at the top of the FBI.
568	Donald Trump	It's a disgrace.
569	Donald Trump	And our Justice Department, which I try and stay away from, but at some point I won't.
570	Brian Kilmeade	OK.
571	Donald Trump	Our Justice Department should be looking at that kind of stuff, not the nonsense of collusion with Russia.
572	Donald Trump	There is no collusion with me --
573	Ainsley Earhardt	All right.
574	Brian Kilmeade	All right.
575	Donald Trump	-- and Russia, and everyone knows it.
576	Brian Kilmeade	Everyone.
577	Brian Kilmeade	We could talk to you all day but it looks like --
578	Donald Trump	Sure.
579	Brian Kilmeade	-- you have a million things to do.
580	Donald Trump	Well, you could have --
581	Brian Kilmeade	But I hope you can join us again, Mr. President.
582	Ainsley Earhardt	Thank you so much for much for being with us.
583	Donald Trump	And, Ainsley, good luck with your book.
584	Donald Trump	It's going to be a winner.
585	Ainsley Earhardt	Thank you.
586	Ainsley Earhardt	Thank you so much.
587	Steve Doocy	And happy birthday to Melania.
588	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
589	Brian Kilmeade	We'll see you next Thursday, Mr. President.
590	Donald Trump	OK, thank you.
591	Brian Kilmeade	The phone line's open.
592	Donald Trump	Sounds OK.
593	Steve Doocy	Call in again some time.
594	Ainsley Earhardt	Thank you.
595	Donald Trump	Good.
596	Donald Trump	Thank you, bye.
597	Brian Kilmeade	Very nice of you to call in.
