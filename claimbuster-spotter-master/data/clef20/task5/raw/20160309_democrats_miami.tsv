35	SYSTEM	[ through translator ]
36	RAMOS	We will make our questions in English and they will be translated simultaneously into Spanish for our viewers.
37	RAMOS	And right now, each one of them has one minute for your initial words.
38	RAMOS	We begin with Secretary Clinton.
39	CLINTON	Thank you very much.
40	CLINTON	I've been looking forward to this debate, and I want to thank Univision, the Washington Post, Facebook and Miami-Dade College, the largest college in North America for hosting us here this evening.
41	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
42	CLINTON	And tonight I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how we knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying ahead, starting with the economic ones.
43	CLINTON	My focus is on more good paying jobs with rising incomes for families and how we prevent corporations from taking jobs out of our country by imposing an exit tax, making them pay back any tax breaks they've gotten.
44	CLINTON	But we also need to be having a positive agenda for manufacturing.
45	CLINTON	for small businesses and entrepreneurs, for more clean energy jobs.
46	CLINTON	And I also look forward to discussing comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship that will be one of my priorities in my first 100 days as president.
47	CLINTON	And I will also be talking about education, every child deserves a good teacher and a good school.
48	SALINAS	Thank you, Secretary.
49	CLINTON	And so thank you for having us, and I look forward to the debate.
50	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
51	SALINAS	Thank you.
52	SALINAS	Senator Sanders, your opening remarks.
53	SANDERS	Thank you — thank you all very much.
54	SANDERS	I'm running for president of the United States because given the crises facing our country, it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.
55	SANDERS	Together we're going to have to overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision.
56	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
57	SANDERS	Billionaires and Wall Street should not be buying elections.
58	SANDERS	We've got to end this rigged economy where people are working longer hours for low wages, almost all new income and wealth going to the top 1 percent, and of course, we need comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship.
59	SANDERS	And here in Miami...
60	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
61	SANDERS	...here in Miami as much as any city in America, we know that we have got to combat climate change, transform our energy system, and leave this planet in a way that is healthy and habitable for our kids and our grandchildren.
62	SALINAS	Thank you, Senator.
63	SALINAS	First question, Secretary, you have been starting to sound like the nominee lately, but many voters are saying, not so fast.
64	SALINAS	Where did you fail last night in Michigan?
65	CLINTON	Well, look, I won one of the contests and lost another close one.
66	CLINTON	I am continuing to work hard for every single vote across our country.
67	CLINTON	I was pleased that I got 100,000 more votes last night than my opponent and more delegates.
68	CLINTON	So this is a marathon, and it's a marathon that can only be carried out by the kind of inclusive campaign that I'm running, a campaign that reaches out to everybody, a campaign that offers real positive solutions to the problems that we face, a campaign that is based on how together we can make progress, because I am a progressive who likes to get things done.
69	CLINTON	So I'm excited about the upcoming contests, including right here in Florida.
70	CLINTON	And we'll continue to work as hard as I can to earn the vote of every single voter.
71	SALINAS	What went wrong in Michigan?
72	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
73	SALINAS	What went wrong in Michigan?
74	SALINAS	What went wrong in Michigan?
75	SALINAS	What failed in Michigan specifically?
76	CLINTON	It was a very close race.
77	CLINTON	We've had some of those.
78	CLINTON	I've won some.
79	CLINTON	I've lost some.
80	CLINTON	But, you know, I was very pleased by the overall outcome last night.
81	CLINTON	And now we're on to the states for next Tuesday and I'm looking forward to campaigning hard in all of them.
82	SALINAS	Senator, aside from your astounding upset last night in Michigan, you are still far behind Secretary Clinton in delegate count.
83	SALINAS	She has 1,221 delegates, including superdelegates, and you have 571.
84	SALINAS	What is your pathway to make up the deficit, and can you realistically catch up?
85	SANDERS	Well, you know, when we began this campaign, I was 3% in the polls.
86	SANDERS	I was probably 60 or 70 points behind the Secretary.
87	SANDERS	We have come a long way in 10 months.
88	SANDERS	We have won...
89	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
90	SANDERS	...including Michigan last night, which some people,considered one of the major political upsets in modern American history.
91	SANDERS	We have won nine state primaries and caucuses.
92	SANDERS	And I believe that our message of the need for people to stand up and tell corporate America and Wall Street that they cannot have it all is resonating across this country.
93	SANDERS	And I think in the coming weeks and months, we are going to continue to do extremely well, win a number of these primaries, and convince superdelegates that Bernie Sanders is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump.
94	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
95	RAMOS	Secretary Clinton, I want to disclose once again that my daughter Paula works for your campaign.
96	RAMOS	And now I have a question about your emails.
97	RAMOS	Your Republican opponents say that those emails have endangered our national security.
98	RAMOS	When you were secretary of state, you wrote 104 emails in your private server that the government now says contain classified information according to The Washington Post analysis.
99	RAMOS	That goes against a memo that you personally sent to your employees in 2011 directing all of them to use official email, precisely because of security concerns.
100	RAMOS	So it seems that you issued one set of rules for yourself and a different set of rules for the rest of the State Department.
101	RAMOS	So who specifically gave you permission to operate your email system as you did?
102	RAMOS	Was it President Barack Obama?
103	RAMOS	And would you drop out of the race if you get indicted?
104	CLINTON	Well, Jorge, there's a lot of questions in there.
105	CLINTON	And I'm going to give the same answer I've been giving for many months.
106	CLINTON	It wasn't the best choice.
107	CLINTON	I made a mistake.
108	CLINTON	It was not prohibited.
109	CLINTON	It was not in any way disallowed.
110	CLINTON	And as I have said and as now has come out, my predecessors did the same thing and many other people in the government.
111	CLINTON	But here's the cut to the chase facts.
112	CLINTON	I did not send or receive any emails marked classified at the time.
113	CLINTON	What you are talking about is retroactive classification.
114	CLINTON	And the reason that happens is when somebody asks or when you are asked to make information public, I asked all my emails to be made public.
115	CLINTON	Then all the rest of the government gets to weigh in.
116	CLINTON	And some other parts of the government, we're not exactly sure who, has concluded that some of the emails should be now retroactively classified.
117	CLINTON	They've just said the same thing to former Secretary Colin Powell.
118	CLINTON	They have said, we're going to retroactively classify emails you sent personally.
119	CLINTON	Now I think he was right when he said this is an absurdity.
120	CLINTON	And I think that what we have got here is a case of overclassification.
121	RAMOS	If we get your permission...
122	CLINTON	I am not concerned about it.
123	CLINTON	I am not worried about it and no Democrat or American should be either.
124	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
125	RAMOS	Secretary Clinton, the questions were, who gave you permission to cooperate?
126	RAMOS	Was it President Obama?
127	CLINTON	There was no permission to be asked.
128	CLINTON	It had been done by my predecessors.
129	CLINTON	It was permitted.
130	RAMOS	If you get indicted would you going to drop out?
131	CLINTON	Oh, for goodness — that's not going to happen.
132	CLINTON	I'm not even answering that question.
133	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
134	RAMOS	Senator Sanders, you have gone from saying the following, the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e- mails, to claiming that it is a very serious issue.
135	RAMOS	Which is it?
136	SANDERS	There is a process under way, and that process will take its course.
137	SANDERS	Today in America, the middle class is disappearing.
138	SANDERS	We have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, climate change threatens the whole planet, 47 million people live in poverty.
139	SANDERS	I'm going to focus on the issues facing the working families of this country.
140	SANDERS	That process specifically.
141	TUMULTY	Secretary Clinton, you have known Donald Trump a long time.
142	TUMULTY	You have seen what kind of campaign he's running.
143	TUMULTY	Secretary Clinton, is Donald Trump a racist?
144	CLINTON	Karen, I'm going to follow my friend Senator Sanders model here.
145	CLINTON	If I'm so fortunate enough to be the Democratic nominee, there will be a lot of time to talk about him.
146	CLINTON	I was the first one to call him out.
147	CLINTON	I called him out when he was calling Mexicans rapists.
148	CLINTON	When he was engaging in rhetoric that I found deeply offensive.
149	CLINTON	I said basta, and I am pleased that others...
150	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
151	CLINTON	...others are also joining in making clear that his rhetoric, his demagoguery, his trafficking in prejudice and paranoia has no place in our political system.
152	CLINTON	Especially from somebody running for president who couldn't decide whether or not to disavow the Ku Klux Klan and David Duke.
153	CLINTON	So people can draw their own conclusions about him.
154	CLINTON	I will just end by saying this.
155	CLINTON	You don't make America great by getting rid of everything that made America great.
156	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
157	TUMULTY	Secretary Clinton, my question was about his character.
158	TUMULTY	And that is one of the primary things that Americans think about when they choose their next president.
159	TUMULTY	How would you describe the character of a person who has said the sorts of things he has about Mexican immigrants, about women, and who would ban people from entering this country based on their religion?
160	CLINTON	I think it's un-American.
161	CLINTON	I think what he has promoted is not at all in keeping with American values, Karen.
162	CLINTON	And I am going to take every opportunity to criticize him, to raise those issues.
163	CLINTON	I'm not going to engage in the kind of language that he uses.
164	CLINTON	I think we can make the case against him if he is the nominee, by pointing out what he has said.
165	CLINTON	What he claims to believe in The values he's promoting and I think that's a better way for the American people to draw their conclusions.
166	TUMULTY	Senator Sanders, do you think it's fair to call Donald Trump a racist?
167	SANDERS	This is what I think.
168	SANDERS	I think that the American people are never going to elect a president who insults Mexicans, who insults Muslims, who insults women, who insults African-Americans.
169	SANDERS	And let us not forget that several years ago, Trump was in the middle of the so- called birther movement, trying to delegitimize the president of the United States of America.
170	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
171	SANDERS	You know, I find it very interesting, Karen, my dad was born in Poland.
172	SANDERS	I know a little bit about the immigrant experience.
173	SANDERS	Nobody has ever asked me for my birth certificate.
174	SANDERS	Maybe it has something to do with the color of my skin.
175	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
176	TUMULTY	So what does that tell you about his character?
177	SANDERS	And I am very pleased — I am very pleased that I think in the last national poll that I saw, we were running 18 points ahead of Donald Trump.
178	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
179	RAMOS	On
180	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
181	RAMOS	, people are talking about immigration, and this map shows where in the country they are talking about it the most.
182	RAMOS	Maria Elena?
183	SALINAS	So Secretary, I have a question for you.
184	SALINAS	In 2003, you said on a radio show, specifically it was John Gambling's radio show in New York, that you were adamantly against illegal immigrants and that people have to stop employing illegal immigrants.
185	SALINAS	Your new immigration plan is that you would expand President Obama's executive actions and that you would push for legislation that would include a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.
186	SALINAS	So, are you flip-flopping on this issue?
187	SALINAS	Or are you pandering to Latinos, what some would call Hispandering?
188	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
189	CLINTON	In 2003, I sponsored the DREAMER Act.
190	CLINTON	I sponsored I think in every Congress after that.
191	CLINTON	I have been consistent and committed to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
192	CLINTON	I think our best chance was in 2007, when Ted Kennedy led the charge on comprehensive immigration reform.
193	CLINTON	We have Republican support.
194	CLINTON	We had a president willing to sign it.
195	CLINTON	I voted for that bill.
196	CLINTON	Senator Sanders voted against it.
197	CLINTON	Just think, imagine where we would be today is we had achieved comprehensive immigration reform nine years ago.
198	CLINTON	Imagine how much more secure families would be in our country, no longer fearing the deportation of a loved one; no longer fearing that they would be found out.
199	CLINTON	So I am staunchly in favor of comprehensive immigration reform and have been so over the course of my public career.
200	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
201	SALINAS	Now, Senator Sanders, in 2007, you voted against immigration reform.
202	SALINAS	You now say that it was because the bill had guestworker provisions which seemed semi-slavery.
203	SALINAS	But back then, this is what you said to CNN's Lou Dobbs.
204	SALINAS	Let's listen.
205	SYSTEM	[ begin video clip ]
206	SANDERS	Poverty is increasing.
207	SANDERS	And if wages are going down, I don't know why we need millions of people to be coming into this country as guestworkers who will work for lower wages than American workers and drive wages down even lower than they are right now.
208	SYSTEM	[ end video clip ]
209	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
210	SALINAS	So, Senator, were you concerned with working conditions for guestworkers, or really because you think immigrants drive down wages and take jobs from Americans?
211	SANDERS	Well, you have guestworker programs that have been described by the Southern Poverty Law Center, one of the important institutions in this country who studies these issues, as guestworkers programs akin to slavery, where people came in.
212	SANDERS	They were cheated.
213	SANDERS	They were abused.
214	SANDERS	They were humiliated.
215	SANDERS	And if they stood up for their rights, they would be thrown out of the country.
216	SANDERS	Of course, that type of
217	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
218	SANDERS	leads to a race to the bottom for all of our people.
219	SANDERS	And I worked very hard on that issue.
220	SANDERS	And of course, I supported the 2013 immigration reform bill.
221	SANDERS	And what I believe right now is not only that we need comprehensive immigration reform, if the Congress does not do its job, as president of the United States I will use the executive powers of that office to do what has to be done, to do what President Obama did, and expand on that.
222	SALINAS	But if you're saying that you would...
223	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
224	SALINAS	...if you're saying that you would expand on the executive actions, how do you that they're not going to end up in a legal battle just like Obama's executive actions?
225	SANDERS	Well, we do the best — we don't know.
226	SANDERS	And I should also say with regard to that 2007 immigration bill, as you may know, LULAC, the major Hispanic organization in his country, also opposed that bill as did many other Latino organizations.
227	SANDERS	But to your point, we have to do the best we can.
228	SANDERS	I applaud President Obama for his efforts on DAPA and DACA.
229	SANDERS	And I think we have got to expand those efforts.
230	CLINTON	If I could...
231	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
232	CLINTON	You know, I think it's very hard to make the case that Ted Kennedy, Barack Obama, me, La Raza, United Farmworkers, Dolores Huerta, leaders of the Latino community, would have supported a bill that actually promoted modern slavery.
233	CLINTON	That was one of the many excuses used not to vote for the 2007 bill.
234	CLINTON	And I will go back to what I said.
235	CLINTON	If we had been able to get that passed, we would be so much further along now.
236	CLINTON	I'm committed to defending DAPA and DACA.
237	CLINTON	I'm committed to going even further to get more people deferred action, to go as far as I can under the law.
238	CLINTON	And I am committed to introducing comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship in the first 100 days of my presidency.
239	SALINAS	Secretary Sanders (sic).
240	SALINAS	Senator, would you like to respond?
241	SANDERS	Well, when we talk about efforts to assist immigrants, Secretary Clinton prevailed upon the governor of New York, Elliot Spitzer, who wanted to do the right thing and provide driver's license to these who were undocumented, she said don't do it, and New York State still does not do it.
242	SANDERS	In Vermont, by the way, I worked with officials and undocumented people in Vermont do have the ability to get driver's license.
243	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
244	SANDERS	When we talk about immigration, the secretary will remember that one of the great tragedies, human tragedies of recent years is children came from Honduras where there's probably more violence than almost any place in this country, and they came into this country.
245	SANDERS	And I said welcome those children into this country, Secretary Clinton said send them back.
246	SANDERS	That's a difference.
247	CLINTON	Let me — let me respond again because the misrepresentation can't go unanswered here.
248	CLINTON	First of all, that is something that is not fair about what I said.
249	CLINTON	I did say we needed to be very concerned about little children coming to this country — on their own, very often — many of them not making it.
250	CLINTON	And when they got here, they needed, as I have argued for, legal counsel, due process, to make a decision.
251	CLINTON	We need to end private detention, we need to end family detention.
252	CLINTON	And in 2006, when Senator Sanders was running for the Senate from Vermont, he voted in the House with hard-line Republicans for indefinite detention for undocumented immigrants, and then he sided with those Republicans to stand with vigilantes known as Minute Men who were taking up outposts along the border to hunt down immigrants.
253	CLINTON	So I think when you were running for the Senate, you made it clear by your vote, Senator, that you were going to stand with the Republicans.
254	CLINTON	When you got to the Senate in 2007, one of the first things you did was vote against Ted Kennedy's immigration reform which he'd been working on for years before you ever arrived.
255	SALINAS	One last response.
256	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
257	SANDERS	Let me respond — let me respond to that.
258	SALINAS	Go ahead.
259	SANDERS	You know, Ted Kennedy was a very close friend of mine, and I served on the committee he chaired, the Health, Education, Labor Committee.
260	SANDERS	And Ted Kennedy was kind enough to allow me to hold a hearing in 2008, I believe, in Congress, dealing with the plight of undocumented tomato pickers in Immokalee, Florida.
261	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
262	SANDERS	And I went there on my own.
263	SANDERS	Wasn't an issue really for the state of Vermont to expose the horrendous working conditions and the semi slavery, if you like, that those workers lived under.
264	SANDERS	And the result of that hearing and the work that many, many people did was to significantly improve the wages and working conditions of those workers.
265	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
266	RAMOS	Senator, Secretary, we're going to take a break and we'll continue talking about immigration when we come back.
267	CLINTON	Great.
268	CLINTON	Thank you.
269	CLINTON	RAMOS
270	SYSTEM	[ through translator ]
271	RAMOS	So this is the moment of talking about deportations.
272	RAMOS	We're going to immigrants.
273	SYSTEM	[ through translator ]
274	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ] Facebook page [ inaudible ]
275	SALINAS	Tell us what you think of the debate in the comment section.
276	SALINAS	We will come back after the break.
277	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
278	SYSTEM	[ through translator ]
279	RAMOS	We're back to the Democratic debate.
280	RAMOS	Secretary Clinton, the last time we talked in January, in Iowa, I asked you if you could be the next deporting chief.
281	RAMOS	And you told me, no, that you wouldn't be the next deporter in chief.
282	RAMOS	However, you refused two times to say you would not deport children.
283	RAMOS	This is what you said.
284	SYSTEM	[ begin video clip ]
285	RAMOS	And can you promise that you won't deport immigrants who don't have a criminal record?
286	CLINTON	Here's what I can promise Jorge, I can promise that I will do everything possible to provide due process.
287	RAMOS	But will you deport children?
288	CLINTON	Let me say this.
289	CLINTON	I would give every person, but particularly children, due process to have their story told.
290	CLINTON	And a lot of children will, of course, have very legitimate stories under our law to be able to stay.
291	SYSTEM	[ end video clip ]
292	RAMOS	So secretary, you seem to be defending President Obama's deportation policy.
293	RAMOS	And as you know, so far he has deported more than 2.5 million immigrants.
294	RAMOS	So if you really don't want to be the next deporter in chief, can you promise tonight that you won't deport children and that you won't deport immigrants who don't have a criminal record and this time, could I get a yes or no answer?
295	CLINTON	Yes, you can because the question you were asking me were about children seeking asylum.
296	CLINTON	And we have laws.
297	CLINTON	That was the most critical thing I said.
298	CLINTON	Under our laws.
299	CLINTON	I would like to see those laws changed.
300	CLINTON	I would like see added to them, a guaranteed counsel and other support for children.
301	CLINTON	But if you are asking about everyone who is already here, undocumented immigrants, the 11-12 million who are living here, my priorities are to deport violent criminals, terrorists, and anyone who threatens our safety.
302	CLINTON	So I do not have the same policy as the current administration does.
303	CLINTON	I think it's important that we move to our comprehensive immigration reform, but at the same time, stop the raids, stop the round-ups, stop the deporting of people who are living here doing their lives, doing their jobs, and that's my priority.
304	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
305	RAMOS	But again, yes or no, can you promise tonight that you won't deport children, children who are already here?
306	CLINTON	I will not deport children.
307	CLINTON	I would not deport children.
308	CLINTON	I do not want to deport family members either, Jorge.
309	CLINTON	I want to, as I said, prioritize who would be deported: violent criminals, people planning terrorist attacks, anybody who threatens us.
310	CLINTON	That's a relatively small universe.
311	RAMOS	OK.
312	RAMOS	So I want to be very specific.
313	RAMOS	So you are telling us tonight that if you become president you won't deport children who are already here?
314	CLINTON	I will not.
315	RAMOS	And that you won't deport immigrants who don't have a criminal record?
316	CLINTON	That's what I'm telling you.
317	CLINTON	Now I don't want — because I'm not contradicting what I told you in the interview.
318	CLINTON	Asylum is a particular legal process.
319	CLINTON	I'd like to see it changed.
320	CLINTON	I'd like to see us give more support to people who come fleeing the terrible violence that they do.
321	CLINTON	But under our law, we have a process we have to go through which is different.
322	RAMOS	So you will stop those deportations.
323	CLINTON	I would stop...
324	RAMOS	The deportations for children...
325	CLINTON	Yes.
326	RAMOS	... and those who don't have a criminal record.
327	CLINTON	Of the people, the undocumented people living in our country, I do not want to see them deported.
328	CLINTON	I want to see them on a path to citizenship.
329	CLINTON	That is exactly what I will do.
330	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
331	RAMOS	Senator Sanders, would you — can you promise us tonight that you won't deport children?
332	SANDERS	Let me just say this.
333	SANDERS	I don't think that the secretary fully answered your question, and I think the proof may be in the pudding.
334	SANDERS	Honduras and that region of the world may be the most violent region in our hemisphere.
335	SANDERS	Gang lords, vicious people torturing people, doing horrible things to families.
336	SANDERS	Children fled that part of the world to try, try, try, try, maybe, to meet up with their family members in this country, taking a route that was horrific, trying to start a new life.
337	SANDERS	Secretary Clinton did not support those children coming into this country.
338	SANDERS	I did.
339	SANDERS	Now I happen to agree with President Obama on many, many issues.
340	SANDERS	I think he has done a great job as president of the United States.
341	SANDERS	He is wrong on this issue of deportation.
342	SANDERS	I disagree with him on that.
343	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
344	SANDERS	So to answer your question, no, I will not deport children from the United States of America.
345	RAMOS	And can you promise not to deport immigrants who don't have a criminal record?
346	SANDERS	I can make that promise.
347	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
348	CLINTON	This is why I go back to that 2007 vote because if we had been successful then, a lot of the issues we are still discussing today would be in the rear-view mirror.
349	CLINTON	I want us to be able to achieve comprehensive immigration reform if I'm so fortunate enough to be president.
350	CLINTON	And we do have to take a look at asylum laws.
351	CLINTON	When I was secretary of state, I worked to try to support many different approaches to ending the violence in Central America.
352	CLINTON	I was there meeting with leaders, security leaders, and others.
353	CLINTON	And I think the Congress should support the president's request to fund programs that would protect people and change the culture of criminality and violence in Central America, helping people be able to stay safely in their homes and countries.
354	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
355	SANDERS	Let me just answer, I want to get back to this 2007 immigration bill.
356	SANDERS	It's true, Ted Kennedy, a good friend of mine, and I think of the secretary's, did work very hard on that bill.
357	SANDERS	But does anyone really believe that if that bill was all so good, as the secretary is touting, that LULAC and other major Latino organizations, the largest Latino organizations in this country said no to that bill.
358	SANDERS	And I worked very hard in improving the guest worker provisions so that in 2013 a bill I strongly supported, people who were in the guest worker program in America would not be treated like slaves.
359	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
360	CLINTON	Let me just conclude by saying that United Farm Workers considered that bill in their words the last best hope for farm workers and immigrants.
361	CLINTON	They have proven to be right in the succeeding years.
362	CLINTON	I only hope that we can put together a coalition to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the next Congress.
363	CLINTON	And as I said earlier, in 2006, Senator Sanders supported indefinite detention for people facing deportation...
364	SANDERS	It's...
365	CLINTON	...and stood with the Minutemen vigilantes in their ridiculous, absurd efforts to, quote, "hunt down immigrants.
366	CLINTON	So look, I think the goal here is to elect a Democratic Senate, elect a Democratic president and get to work immediately to get comprehensive immigration reform.
367	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
368	RAMOS	Did you support the Minutemen, Senator?
369	RAMOS	Did you support the Minutemen?
370	SANDERS	I'm sorry?
371	RAMOS	Did you support the Minutemen, as Secretary Clinton has said?
372	SANDERS	Of course not.
373	SANDERS	There was a piece of legislation supported by dozens and dozens of members of the House which codified existing legislation.
374	SANDERS	What the secretary is doing tonight and has done very often is take large pieces of legislation and take pieces out of it.
375	SANDERS	No, I did not oppose the bailout or the support of the automobile industry.
376	SANDERS	No, I do not support vigilantes, and that is a horrific statement, an unfair statement to make.
377	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
378	SANDERS	I will stand
379	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
380	SANDERS	of my career, political career fighting for workers, fighting for the poorest people in this country.
381	SANDERS	Madame Secretary, I will match my record against yours any day of the week.
382	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
383	CLINTON	Well, let's do that.
384	CLINTON	Let's talk about that.
385	CLINTON	Let's talk about that.
386	RAMOS	Secretary, you said this morning...
387	CLINTON	Let's talk about the auto bailout because I think it's important for people to understand what happened.
388	CLINTON	In December of 2008, we were both in the Senate, there was a vote on a free-standing bill to rescue the auto industry.
389	CLINTON	We both voted for it.
390	CLINTON	was the right vote.
391	CLINTON	Unfortunately, it did not succeed.
392	CLINTON	The Republicans marshalled the votes against it.
393	CLINTON	A month later, in January, a new piece of legislation was offered that contained the money that would be used for the auto rescue.
394	CLINTON	Then President-elect Obama — before he'd even been sworn in — sent word to all of us that he really hoped we would support it.
395	CLINTON	He was still in the Senate, I was still in the Senate.
396	CLINTON	And I voted for it.
397	CLINTON	It was a hard vote.
398	CLINTON	I'll tell you, it was a hard vote.
399	CLINTON	A lot of the votes you make are hard votes.
400	CLINTON	But the fact is the money that rescued the auto industry was in that bill.
401	SALINAS	Secretary...
402	CLINTON	Now, Senator Sanders voted against it.
403	CLINTON	That's his perfect right to vote against it.
404	CLINTON	But if everyone had voted as he voted...
405	RAMOS	OK, Senator.
406	SANDERS	Yeah, let me...
407	CLINTON	... we would not have rescued the auto industry.
408	RAMOS	You have 30 seconds and then we'll pass to another.
409	RAMOS	Thirty more seconds and then we'll move to another...
410	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
411	SANDERS	Let me — let's — so that everybody knows, the bill that Secretary Clinton is talking about, that is — that was the bailout of the recklessness, irresponsibility and illegal behavior of Wall Street.
412	SANDERS	It was the Wall Street bailout.
413	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
414	SANDERS	And I find it interesting that when Secretary Clinton, who was the former senator of New York, of course, when she defended her vote, she said, well, it's going to help the big banks in New York.
415	SANDERS	Those are my constituents.
416	SANDERS	And then you go to Detroit and suddenly this legislation helps the automobile workers.
417	SANDERS	There was an article just yesterday...
418	SALINAS	Your time is up, Senator.
419	SANDERS	... where people like Senator Bayh and Ron Wyden, Byron Dorgan...
420	SALINAS	Senator — your time is up, Senator.
421	SANDERS	...former senators said, no, this wasn't the automobile bailout.
422	SANDERS	It was the bailout of Wall Street.
423	RAMOS	Thank you.
424	SALINAS	We have to move on.
425	SALINAS	Senator, the time is up.
426	SALINAS	We have to move on.
427	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
428	SALINAS	Next question.
429	SALINAS	Secretary Clinton, you recently said instead of building walls we need to tear down barriers.
430	SALINAS	However, last November in New Hampshire, you openly said that as senator you voted numerous times to build the wall with Mexico.
431	SALINAS	What's the difference between what you did, voting to build the wall, and what Donald Trump wants to do now?
432	CLINTON	Well, I think both of us, both Senator Sanders and I, voted numerous times to enhance border security along our border.
433	CLINTON	We increased the number of border security agents.
434	CLINTON	We did vote for money to build a fence, a pedestrian fence in some place, a vehicle fence in other places.
435	CLINTON	And the result is that we have the most secure border we've ever had.
436	CLINTON	Apprehensions coming across the border are the lowest they've been in 40 years, which just strengthens my argument that now it's time to do comprehensive immigration reform.
437	CLINTON	The Republicans, the opponents no longer have an argument.
438	CLINTON	And certainly, we hear a lot coming from the Republican side that is absolutely out of touch with reality.
439	CLINTON	We raised money through the congressional appropriations process.
440	CLINTON	We enhanced the border security.
441	CLINTON	That part of the work is done.
442	CLINTON	Everybody that I know has looked at it said, okay, we have a secure border.
443	CLINTON	There's no need for this rhetoric and demagoguery that's still —is carried out on the Republican side.
444	CLINTON	You've run out of excuses.
445	CLINTON	Let's move to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
446	CLINTON	And I think that makes a very strong argument in favor of doing it.
447	SALINAS	But the question is, what is the difference between the wall that you voted for and Donald Trump's wall?
448	CLINTON	It's a big difference.
449	CLINTON	First of all, as I understand him, he's talking about a very tall wall.
450	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
451	CLINTON	Right?
452	CLINTON	A beautiful tall wall.
453	CLINTON	The most beautiful tall wall, better than the Great Wall of China, that would run the entire border.
454	CLINTON	That he would somehow magically get the Mexican government to pay for.
455	CLINTON	And, you know, it's just fantasy.
456	CLINTON	And in fact, if he cared to know anything about what members of Congress, like the senator and I have done, where it was necessary, we did support some fencing.
457	CLINTON	Where it was necessary, we did add border patrol agents.
458	CLINTON	We have done what by any fair estimate would have to conclude is a good job, quote, "securing the border".
459	CLINTON	So let's get about the business of comprehensive immigration reform.
460	SANDERS	Let me just say...
461	SALINAS	Senator...
462	SANDERS	I think the secretary and I mostly, I think, agree on this issue.
463	SANDERS	Look, in this country, immigration reform is a very hot debate.
464	SANDERS	It's divided the country.
465	SANDERS	But I would hope very much, that as we have that debate, we do not, as Donald Trump and others have done, resort to racism and xenophobia and bigotry.
466	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
467	SANDERS	This idea of suddenly, one day or maybe a night, rounding up 11 million people and taking them outside of this country is a vulgar, absurd idea that I would hope very few people in America support.
468	TUMULTY	Your time is up, senator.
469	TUMULTY	Thank you.
470	SALINAS	Now we have a question from the audience for both of you.
471	SYSTEM	[ through translator ]
472	QUESTION	We have a question from the public.
473	QUESTION	I want to go to Lucia Aquiette.
474	QUESTION	She's an immigrant from Guatemala, she's here with her five children who have not seen their father since he was deported three years ago.
475	QUESTION	She has a question for both of you.
476	SYSTEM	[ through translator ]
477	QUESTION	I would like to ask — me and my children — hardworking men in the field —
478	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
479	QUESTION	Senator Sanders, as you can see, these are a very painful and personal issue for Lucia and her family.
480	QUESTION	She wants to know what you would do to stop deportations, but most importantly, to reunite families like hers.
481	SANDERS	Well, I absolutely support that.
482	SANDERS	At the heart of my immigration policy and I should say that the New York times editorial board called my immigration policy the most progressive and the strongest of any candidate running.
483	SANDERS	But to answer your question, the essence of what we are trying to do is to unite families, not to divide families.
484	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
485	SANDERS	The idea that a mother is living here and her children are on the other side of the border is wrong and immoral.
486	SANDERS	A number of months ago, I talked to a young man who was serving in the United States military and while he was serving in the military, his wife was deported.
487	SANDERS	That is beyond comprehension and policies that should not be allowed to exist.
488	SANDERS	So, ma'am, I will do everything that I can to unite your family.
489	SANDERS	Your children deserve to be with their mother.
490	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
491	RAMOS	Thank you Senator Sanders.
492	SYSTEM	[ through translator ]
493	QUESTION	Secretary Clinton, you've also said you want to stop deportations.
494	QUESTION	But what's your plan to reunite families and thousands of children, U.S. citizens, with their parents?
495	CLINTON	First of all, please know how brave I think you are, coming here with your children to tell your story.
496	CLINTON	This is an incredible act of courage that I'm not sure many people really understand.
497	CLINTON	And I want you to know that in the work that I've done and the many families that I've met, I have heard similar stories like yours, where your husband is deported.
498	CLINTON	Your children's father is gone.
499	CLINTON	You are doing your very best to support your children.
500	CLINTON	But it is time to bring families together.
501	CLINTON	And I don't think there's any doubt that we must do more to let stories like yours be heard more widely so that more Americans know what the human cost of these policies are.
502	CLINTON	And I will do everything I can to prevent other families from facing what you are facing.
503	CLINTON	And I will do everything I can to pass laws that would bring families back together.
504	CLINTON	And I hope that your children are all either citizens born in this country or eligible for the programs that President Obama has put into place, DACA and DAPA, because I will defend those and I will absolutely protect your children, yourself, and try to bring your family back together.
505	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
506	QUESTION	Secretary Clinton, thank you.
507	QUESTION	Secretary Clinton, they are U.S. citizens
508	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
509	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
510	QUESTION	Thank you.
511	QUESTION	Now let's go back to Karen.
512	TUMULTY	Thank you, Enrique.
513	TUMULTY	Secretary Clinton, a Washington Post poll just yesterday found that only 37 percent of Americans consider you honest and trustworthy.
514	TUMULTY	Now, when you've been asked about this in the past, you have said that this is the result of many, many years of Republican attacks upon you.
515	TUMULTY	But Americans have also had 25 — more than that — years to get to know you for themselves.
516	TUMULTY	Is there anything in your own actions and the decisions that you yourself have made that would foster this kind of mistrust?
517	CLINTON	Well, first Karen, obviously it's painful for me to hear that.
518	CLINTON	And I do take responsibility.
519	CLINTON	When you're in public life, even if you believe that it's not an opinion that you think is fair or founded, you do have to take responsibility.
520	CLINTON	And I do.
521	CLINTON	And I also have, you know, very much committed to the best of my ability my energies and efforts to helping people.
522	CLINTON	That's something that I care deeply about.
523	CLINTON	And I will continue to do that, to demonstrate by my past actions and my present levels of commitment and plans that people can count on me.
524	CLINTON	That is certainly what happened to me in New York, where people got to know me.
525	CLINTON	They saw me in action.
526	CLINTON	And they did.
527	CLINTON	Look, I have said before and it won't surprise anybody to hear me say it, this is not easy for me.
528	CLINTON	It's not easy to do what I think is right, to help people, to even the odds, to hear a story like the woman's story we just heard.
529	CLINTON	And to know that I can make a difference and I want to in every way possible.
530	CLINTON	I am not a natural politician, in case you haven't noticed, like my husband or President Obama.
531	CLINTON	So I have a view that I just have to do the best I can, get the results I can, make a difference in people's lives, and hope that people see that I'm fighting for them and that I can improve conditions economically and other ways that will benefit them and their families.
532	TUMULTY	Thank you.
533	TUMULTY	Thank you.
534	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
535	TUMULTY	Senator Sanders, you have demanded that Secretary Clinton release the transcripts of her paid Wall Street speeches.
536	TUMULTY	Why is this important?
537	TUMULTY	Do you have reason to believe that she says one thing in private and another in public?
538	SANDERS	Well, what I have said is that when you get I believe it is $225,000 for giving a speech, and she gave several speeches to Goldman Sachs, one of the Wall Street financial institutions whose greed and illegal behavior helped destroy our economy a number of years ago, when you get paid $225,000, that means that that speech must have been an extraordinarily wonderful speech.
539	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
540	TUMULTY	So does this mean that you would not think she should have to disclose...
541	SANDERS	I would think that a speech so great that you got paid so much money for, you would like to share it with the American people.
542	SANDERS	So I think she should release the transcript.
543	SYSTEM	[ laughter and applause ]
544	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
545	SANDERS	As the secretary said, well, she will do it if other people do it.
546	SANDERS	I will do it.
547	SANDERS	I didn't give any speeches, there is no transcript.
548	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
549	TUMULTY	But my question was, do you think she saying one thing in the speeches and another in public?
550	SANDERS	That is exactly what releasing the transcripts will tell us.
551	SANDERS	This I do know.
552	SANDERS	This I do know.
553	SANDERS	There is a reason why Wall Street has provided $15 million just in the last reporting period to the secretary's super PAC.
554	SANDERS	Now, the secretary says it doesn't influence her.
555	SANDERS	Well, that's what every politician says who gets money from special interests.
556	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
557	SANDERS	The question that the American people have to determine - you know, can you say that Wall Street is greedy, they're fraudulent, but they're not dumb.
558	SANDERS	Why are they making those kind of large contributions?
559	TUMULTY	Thank you, your time is up.
560	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
561	CLINTON	Well, let me respond, as I have numerous times during this campaign.
562	CLINTON	You know, I have a public record and you can go look it up.
563	CLINTON	I went to Wall Street before the Great Recession and basically called them out, said that their behavior was putting our economy at risk, called for a moratorium on foreclosures.
564	CLINTON	I went to the Orlando area during the '08 campaign to make the same case, visiting with families who had been defrauded by mortgages, these subprime mortgages that put them and their homes at risk.
565	TUMULTY	Thank you, Secretary Clinton.
566	CLINTON	I called for those changes.
567	CLINTON	I have been on the record and now I do have the toughest, most comprehensive plan to go after Wall Street.
568	CLINTON	And not just the big banks, all the other financial interests that pose a threat to our economy.
569	CLINTON	And I have said no bank is too big to fail and no executive is too powerful to jail, and I will use the powers that have now been passed by the Congress, by President Obama, who, incidentally, took a lot of money from Wall Street, which didn't stop him from signing into law the toughest regulations on the financial industry since the Great Depression.
570	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
571	SANDERS	Look, clearly, clearly, the secretary's words to Wall Street has really intimidated them, and that is why they have given her $15 million in campaign contributions.
572	TUMULTY	Thank you, Senator.
573	SANDERS	Now, what I believe is in fact that we have a corrupt campaign finance system.
574	SANDERS	And it's not just Wall Street, it's the drug companies,
575	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
576	SANDERS	received millions of dollars from the fossil fuel industry.
577	SANDERS	We've got to overturn Citizens United and end that.
578	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
579	CLINTON	Wait a minute.
580	CLINTON	I just think it's worth pointing out that the leaders of the fossil fuel industry, the Koch brothers, have just paid to put up an ad praising Senator Sanders.
581	CLINTON	There are a lot of different powerful interests in Washington.
582	CLINTON	I've taken them on.
583	CLINTON	I took on the drug companies.
584	CLINTON	I took on the insurance companies.
585	CLINTON	Before there was something called Obamacare, there was something called Hillarycare, and I worked really hard...
586	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
587	CLINTON	...to get comprehensive health care reform, and they beat me.
588	CLINTON	So I have a long record of standing up to special interests.
589	CLINTON	And I will continue to do so.
590	RAMOS	We're going to move on to the next question.
591	SYSTEM	[ booing ] [ crosstalk ]
592	SYSTEM	[ laughter and applause ]
593	RAMOS	You have 30 seconds, Senator.
594	SANDERS	There is nobody in the United States Congress who has taken on the Koch brothers, who want to destroy Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and virtually every federal program passed since the 1930s more that Bernie Sanders.
595	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
596	SANDERS	And I am proud that the gentleman who is head of Goldman Sachs, now, he didn't give me $225,000 for speaking fees, he said I was dangerous and he's right.
597	SANDERS	I am dangerous for Wall Street.
598	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
599	CLINTON	Well, if I can say...
600	RAMOS	We're going to move on to the secretary.
601	CLINTON	... you know though, I guess Senator Sanders, that the Koch brothers, as you said, are sensible with how they use their money.
602	CLINTON	And I agree with you.
603	CLINTON	They stand for things that I find abhorrent, that would be bad for our country, bad for our future.
604	CLINTON	But they did just put up a little video praising you for being the only Democrat who stood with the Republicans to try to eliminate the Export/Import Bank, which has helped hundreds and hundreds of companies here in Florida be able to export their goods and employ more Floridians.
605	CLINTON	So from my perspective, you sided with the Koch brothers.
606	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
607	SANDERS	Let me respond.
608	RAMOS	Yes.
609	RAMOS	Just a few seconds.
610	SANDERS	The Export/Import Bank is often called the bank of Boeing, because Boeing corporation gets 40 percent of the revenue.
611	RAMOS	OK. We're going to move on.
612	SANDERS	It is corporate welfare and yes, I oppose corporate welfare.
613	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
614	RAMOS	OK, next question.
615	RAMOS	I want to continue with the issue of trust.
616	RAMOS	Secretary Clinton, on the night of the attacks in Benghazi, you sent an e-mail to your daughter Chelsea...
617	SYSTEM	[ booing ]
618	RAMOS	...saying, that Al Qaida was responsible for the killing of the Americans.
619	SYSTEM	[ booing ]
620	RAMOS	However, some of the families claim that you lied to them.
621	RAMOS	To that speed, the mother of the information officer, Chaznea.
622	RAMOS	Let's listen.
623	SYSTEM	[ begin video clip ]
624	SMITH	Hillary and Obama and Panetta and Biden and all of — and Susan Rice, all told me it was a video, when they knew it was not the video.
625	SMITH	And they said that they would call me and let me know what the outcome was.
626	SYSTEM	[ end video clip ]
627	RAMOS	Secretary Clinton, did you lie to them?
628	CLINTON	You know, look.
629	CLINTON	I feel a great deal of sympathy for the families of the four brave Americans that we lost at Benghazi.
630	CLINTON	And I certainly can't even imagine the grief that she has for losing her son, but she's wrong.
631	CLINTON	She's absolutely wrong.
632	CLINTON	I and everybody in the administration, all the people she named, the president, the vice president, Susan Rice, we were scrambling to get information that was changing, literally by the hour.
633	CLINTON	And when we had information, we made it public.
634	CLINTON	But then sometimes we had to go back and say we have new information that contradicts it.
635	CLINTON	So I testified for 11 hours.
636	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
637	CLINTON	Anybody who watched that and listened to it knows that I answered every question that I was asked and when it was over the Republicans had to admit they didn't learn anything.
638	CLINTON	Why?
639	CLINTON	Because there had already been one independent investigation.
640	CLINTON	There had been seven or eight congressional investigations, mostly led by Republicans who all reached the same conclusions, that there were lessons to be learned.
641	CLINTON	And this is not the first time we lost Americans in a terrorist attack.
642	CLINTON	We lost 3,000 people on 9/11.
643	CLINTON	We lost Americans serving in embassies in Tanzania and Kenya when my husband was president.
644	CLINTON	We lost 250 Americans, both military and civilian, when Ronald Reagan was president in Beirut.
645	CLINTON	And at no other time were those tragedies were they politicized
646	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
647	CLINTON	Instead people said, let's learn the lessons and save lives.
648	CLINTON	And that's when I did.
649	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
650	RAMOS	But Secretary Clinton, what they're saying is that — what the families are saying is that you told your daughter Chelsea one thing and a different thing to them.
651	CLINTON	Jorge, that makes my point.
652	CLINTON	At the time I e-mailed with my daughter, a terrorist group had taken credit for the attacks on our facility in Benghazi.
653	CLINTON	Within 16, 18 hours, they rescinded taking credit.
654	CLINTON	They did it all on social media.
655	CLINTON	And the video did play a role.
656	CLINTON	We have captured one of the lead terrorists and he admits it was both a terrorist attack and it was influenced by the video.
657	CLINTON	This was fog of war.
658	CLINTON	This was complicated.
659	CLINTON	The most effective, comprehensive reports and studies demonstrate that.
660	CLINTON	Look, as I said in the beginning, I deeply regret that we lost four Americans.
661	RAMOS	Thank you senator.
662	CLINTON	And I of course sympathize with members of the families who are still, you know, very much grieving.
663	CLINTON	And I wish that there could be an easy answer at the time, but we learned a lot, and the intelligence kept...
664	RAMOS	Thank you.
665	CLINTON	... improving, and we learned enough to say what we think happened at Benghazi.
666	RAMOS	You have 30 seconds, Senator.
667	SANDERS	Well, I'm not going to comment on the Benghazi tragedy, but I will say this.
668	SANDERS	A series of articles in the New York Times talked about Secretary Clinton's role in urging the administration to go forward with regime change, getting rid of Gadhafi in Libya.
669	SANDERS	Gadhafi was a brutal dictator, there's no question.
670	SANDERS	But one of the differences between the secretary and I is I'm not quite so aggressive with regard to regime change.
671	SANDERS	I voted against the war in Iraq because I had a fear of what would happen the day after.
672	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
673	SANDERS	And Secretary Clinton talks about Henry Kissinger...
674	RAMOS	Thank you, Senator.
675	SANDERS	... winning the praise of Henry Kissinger, I don't want Henry Kissinger's praise at all.
676	SYSTEM	[ applause ]

696	SALINAS	Good evening, good evening.
697	SALINAS	We heard a lot about immigration, about the deportations and race.
698	SALINAS	In your opinion, who
699	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
700	SALINAS	better and who presented the immigration proposal?
701	SYSTEM	[ through translator ]
702	QUESTION	The two candidates did a good action of talking, explaining, but what concerned me a bit is that we — we haven't seen the plan of Senator Bernie Sanders, and we have not seen a plan in writing from Secretary Hillary Clinton.
703	QUESTION	So we want to see what she says.
704	QUESTION	That is important,
705	QUESTION	The six months — that we have seen as immigration is concerned, and we see that they're moving towards.
706	QUESTION	The community needs to not only immigration reform, but the raids have to stop.
707	QUESTION	Families that we have seen that are suffering, they have to be reunited.

709	UNKNOWN	We heard very emotional testimony of a mother that was brave enough to come here with her five children.

712	SYSTEM	[ through translator ]

714	QUESTION	And those children suffering because they do not have their father.
715	QUESTION	And this is what we see that is happening, that Republicans are doing not — by not approving a migratory reform, but also President Obama.
716	QUESTION	So we need — we need not only words, but plans as well.
717	QUESTION	And we need as a community to both stand up and support women as her.

723	SALINAS	We'll continue with the debate now.
724	SALINAS	Senator Sanders, you call your opponent Hillary Clinton an establishment politician.
725	SALINAS	You yourself are a career politician.
726	SALINAS	Why should voters prefer a career politicians over an establishment politician?
727	SANDERS	Well, you've got to look at what the career is about.
728	SANDERS	And this is a career that has stood up to every special interest in this country.
729	SANDERS	I don't take money from Wall Street.
730	SANDERS	I demand that we break up the large financial institutions.
731	SANDERS	I don't take money from the pharmaceutical industry because I believe they are ripping off the American people and charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
732	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
733	SANDERS	I don't take money from the fossil fuel industry because they are destroying — they are destroying this planet through their emissions of carbon and creating the terrible climate change that we are seeing.
734	SANDERS	So I think it is true that I have served in Congress for many years.
735	SANDERS	But if you check my record, it is a record of strength for the environment, for workers, for seniors.
736	SANDERS	Unlike the secretary, I believe we should expand Social Security benefits.
737	SANDERS	It is a record of achievement for veterans, working with Republicans, helping to craft the most significant veterans healthcare bill passed in many decades.
738	SANDERS	So I think the point is look at the record, and it's a record that I am proud of.
739	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
740	SALINAS	Secretary,
741	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
742	SALINAS	Latinos, according to the Univision-Washington Post poll, the number one issue is jobs and the economy.
743	SALINAS	Latino unemployment rate is higher than the national average.
744	SALINAS	Their net worth has gone down 42 percent during the Obama years, and 60 percent of Latinos make less than $15 an hour.
745	SALINAS	So, last week you tweeted that for the GOP, the economy is an after thought.
746	SALINAS	Well, many Latinos feel that they are an after thought.
747	SALINAS	Do you understand what the specific needs of Latinos are to improve their living conditions?
748	CLINTON	Well, I certainly know what all Americans need, and that is more jobs, with rising incomes.
749	CLINTON	It's something that I have worked on for many years.
750	CLINTON	It's why I've laid down the only really comprehensive plan about how to create more good jobs.
751	CLINTON	And there are several things that need to be addressed.
752	CLINTON	We do have to do more infrastructure spending.
753	CLINTON	That will put many Americans to work.
754	CLINTON	It's a good job that gets you on the ladder to the middle class.
755	CLINTON	We need to improve the conditions for manufacturing in our country and punish those companies that want to export jobs.
756	CLINTON	We need them to be incentivized to create jobs right here in America.
757	CLINTON	We also do have to combat climate change, and no state has more at stake in that than Florida.
758	CLINTON	And the best way to do that is not only enforcing the laws we have, but also the clean power plan that President Obama has put forth that I support, and the Paris agreement that I think was a huge step forward in the world, that Senator Sanders said was too weak, but I helped to lay the groundwork for that.
759	CLINTON	But we need more clean energy jobs and we have to do more to help small businesses.
760	CLINTON	You know, the fastest-growing segment of small businesses are minority and women-owned small business, and we need to help businesses get started.
761	CLINTON	The very distinguished congresswoman from New York who's been on the Small Business Committee, Congresswoman Velasquez, knows exactly what we need to be doing to create more small businesses.
762	CLINTON	We do need to raise the minimum wage and we have to guarantee equal pay for women.
763	SALINAS	Secretary, what would you do...
764	CLINTON	That will help Latinos as well as every other working person in our country.
765	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
766	SALINAS	Secretary, you talked in general terms, but you haven't really said what you would specifically do to improve the living conditions of Latinos.
767	CLINTON	Everything I just said will improve the living conditions, and I've spent a lot of time and effort talking to and mostly listening to Latinos.
768	CLINTON	Jobs are the number one issue, with rising incomes.
769	CLINTON	Close behind is education.
770	CLINTON	Every child deserves a good teacher in a good school, regardless of the zip code that they live in.
771	CLINTON	Following behind that is health care and how important it is to continue to build on the Affordable Care Act and provide access to health care.
772	CLINTON	And then there are a number of other issues — comprehensive immigration reform certainly at the top.
773	SALINAS	Your time is up, Secretary — sorry, your time is up.
774	SANDERS	OK, let me answer that question because it's a huge question.
775	SANDERS	And one of the — huge, I know.
776	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
777	SANDERS	One of the points that I've been making, and media does not seem to pick up on it, is that we have a real crisis not only with real unemployment in America being close to 10 percent, but youth unemployment in this country.
778	SANDERS	If you look at Latino kids between 17 and 20 who graduated high school, 36 percent of them are unemployed or underemployed...
779	SALINAS	Your time is up.
780	SANDERS	Oh wait a minute.
781	SANDERS	Can I have...
782	RAMOS	Go ahead.
783	SANDERS	... a little bit of time here please?
784	SANDERS	African-American kids are unemployed or underemployed to the tune of 51 percent.
785	SANDERS	That's why I co-sponsored legislation to put $5 billion into a jobs program to put our kids to work because I would rather invest in education and jobs than jails and incarceration.
786	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
787	SANDERS	We have got to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
788	SANDERS	The United States has got to join the rest of the industrialized world in guaranteeing health care to all people as a right.
789	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
790	SANDERS	We need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.
791	SANDERS	And when we do that, under my plan, we create 13 million decent-paying jobs.
792	SALINAS	Thank you, Senator.
793	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
794	RAMOS	We have a question on education.
795	RAMOS	Senator, I'll continue with you.
796	RAMOS	You propose free college tuition.
797	SANDERS	No, I do not propose free college tuition, I proposed free tuition at public colleges and universities.
798	SANDERS	Yes I did.
799	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
800	RAMOS	So under your plan, potentially, millions of students who can not truly afford college would be getting federal subsidies.
801	RAMOS	Is that right?
802	SANDERS	No.
803	SANDERS	What they would — look, this is what I believe, Jorge.
804	SANDERS	This is the year 2016.
805	SANDERS	Fifty years ago a high school degree got you a good job in the economy.
806	SANDERS	Today, in many respects, a college degree is the equivalent of a high school degree.
807	SANDERS	We have got to go beyond first grade to 12th grade when we talk about public education.
808	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
809	SANDERS	So I do believe we should make public colleges and universities tuition-free, and I don't believe we should punish millions of young and not-so-young people with outrageous levels of student debt.
810	RAMOS	Because my question was if you think, for instance, if Donald Trump's grandchildren or — I'm sorry — Hillary Clinton's grandchildren, should they be able to go for free?
811	SANDERS	Absolutely.
812	RAMOS	For free.
813	SANDERS	Absolutely.
814	SANDERS	They can go — I don't think they will, but Donald Trump's kids — Donald Trump's kids can go to public school right now, I think Secretary Clinton is talking about making community colleges free, they can go to those things.
815	SANDERS	The point is we are going to get to Donald Trump by raising the taxes on the top 1 percent and our millionaires and billionaires.
816	SANDERS	But all of our people, in my view, regardless of income, should have a right to get a higher education.
817	SANDERS	I want children in the third grade to know that if they study hard, no matter what the income of their families, my family didn't have any income, my parents didn't go to college, they didn't have good income.
818	SANDERS	I want every kid to know if you do your school work, study hard, yes, you will be able to get a college education.
819	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
820	RAMOS	We'll continue this — we'll continue talking about education.
821	RAMOS	For that, we go Enrique Cevedo has a question.
822	RAMOS	Enrique Cevido.
823	SYSTEM	[ through translator ]
824	QUESTION	We just heard about free tuition from Senator Sanders, but right now there are millions of students who can't afford to pay their loans.
825	QUESTION	Maria Martinez is 20 years old and she's a major of political science at Miami-Dade College.
826	UNKNOWN	Secretary Clinton, she said she wants to go to grad school and get a PhD.
827	UNKNOWN	What are you going to do to help her achieve that goal and pay off her student debt?
828	CLINTON	Well, congratulations on your education.
829	CLINTON	And also on your plans for the future.
830	CLINTON	And here's what I will do.
831	CLINTON	We're going to refinance everyone's existing student debt, 40 million Americans have student debt.
832	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
833	CLINTON	And right now, I go around asking people at my events if they know what their interest rate is and the interest rates literally go from like 8 percent to 14 percent.
834	CLINTON	It's outrageous that at a time when interest rates have been historically low, people borrowing money to invest in their education are paying some of the highest interest rates around.
835	CLINTON	And you can refinance your house to get a lower interest rate.
836	CLINTON	You can refinance your car.
837	CLINTON	Corporations can refinance their debt.
838	CLINTON	Under my plan, you will be able to also lower your debt, move into a program to pay it back as a percentage of your income and more than that, my plan for debt-free tuition at public colleges and universities will eventually eliminate any student debt.
839	CLINTON	But for people who have it, I'm going to put a date certain that after a certain number of years, you no longer have to pay anything.
840	CLINTON	The government has to quit making money off of lending money to young people to get their education.
841	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
842	UNKNOWN	Karen, let's go back to you.
843	SANDERS	I think what Secretary Clinton just said is absolutely right.
844	SANDERS	I think I said it many months before she said it, but thanks for copying a very good idea.
845	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
846	SANDERS	Now the question though, you know, I have been criticized a lot for thinking big.
847	SANDERS	You know, that's for believing that we can do great things as a nation.
848	SANDERS	One of the things we should not be doing obviously, is punishing people for doing what we want them to do and that is to get an education.
849	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
850	SANDERS	But here is the point.
851	SANDERS	My program, making public colleges and universities tuition free, allowing people with debt to refinance at the lowest possible interest rates is a fairly expensive proposal, about $70 billion a year.
852	SANDERS	You know how I'm going to pay for it?
853	SANDERS	I'm going to pay for it by imposing a tax on Wall Street speculation.
854	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
855	SANDERS	We bailed out — Secretary Clinton was one of those who voted to bail out Wall Street.
856	SANDERS	Now I think it's time for Wall Street to help the working families of this country.
857	RAMOS	Thank you senator.
858	RAMOS	Thank you very much.
859	CLINTON	Well, I'm going to respond to that, because I think it's a very important issue.
860	CLINTON	And by the way, everybody, who, quote, "got money" in the quote, "bailout", that also included money for the auto rescue has paid it back.
861	CLINTON	So, the Treasury was out nothing.
862	CLINTON	Now that will no longer happen because we have Dodd-Frank and we will break up banks that pose a systemic threat to our economy.
863	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
864	CLINTON	But let me say this.
865	CLINTON	Senator Sanders has talked about free college for everybody.
866	CLINTON	He's talked about universal, single payer health care for everybody.
867	CLINTON	And yet, when you ask questions, as many of us have and more importantly, independent experts, it's very hard to get answers.
868	CLINTON	And a lot of the answers say that this is going to be much more expensive than anything Senator Sanders is admitting to.
869	CLINTON	This is going to increase the federal government dramatically.
870	CLINTON	And, you know, my dad used to say, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
871	SANDERS	All right.
872	SANDERS	Let me respond to this.
873	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
874	CLINTON	And we deserve answers about how these programs will actually work and how they would be paid for.
875	SANDERS	I want you all to think.
876	SANDERS	What Secretary Clinton is saying is that the United States should continue to be the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all of our people.
877	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
878	SANDERS	I think if the rest of the world can do it, we can.
879	SANDERS	And by the way, not only are we being ripped off by the drug companies, we are spending far, far more per capita on health care than any other major country on earth.
880	SANDERS	You may not think the American people are prepared to stand up to the insurance companies or the drug companies.
881	SANDERS	I think they are.
882	SANDERS	And I think we can pass...
883	RAMOS	Thank you senator.
884	RAMOS	[
885	RAMOS	crosstalk ]
886	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
887	CLINTON	This is a very important point in this debate, because I do believe in universal coverage.
888	CLINTON	Remember, I fought for it 25 years ago.
889	CLINTON	I believe in it.
890	CLINTON	And I know that thanks the Affordable Care Act, we are now 90 percent of universal coverage.
891	CLINTON	I will build on the Affordable Care Act.
892	CLINTON	I will take it further.
893	CLINTON	I will reduce the cost.
894	CLINTON	But I just respectfully disagree.
895	CLINTON	Between the Republicans trying to repeal the first chance we've ever had to get to universal health care, and Senator Sanders wanting to throw us into a contentious debate over single-payer, I think the smart approach is build on and protect the Affordable Care Act.
896	CLINTON	Make it work.
897	CLINTON	Reduce the cost.
898	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
899	SANDERS	I'm on the committee, I know a little bit about this, I'm on the committee, Health, Education, Labor Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act.
900	SANDERS	And it has done a number of good things.
901	SANDERS	But when Secretary Clinton says, well, 90 percent of the people have insurance, yes, not really.
902	SANDERS	Many of you may have insurance, but you have outrageously high deductibles and co-payments.
903	SANDERS	One out of five Americans cannot afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe.
904	SANDERS	Elderly people are cutting their pills in half.
905	SANDERS	I do believe that we should do what every other major country on earth does, and I think when the American people stand up and fight back, yes, we can have it, a Medicare for all health care system.
906	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
907	TUMULTY	I'm going to call time here because I want to move on to a subject that more than two dozen Florida mayors have asked to raise with you.
908	TUMULTY	They have asked us to share with you their concern over the effects of rising sea levels and climate change in their communities.
909	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
910	TUMULTY	Just take a look at this map.
911	TUMULTY	You can see that no state has more at stake than Florida does.
912	TUMULTY	And no city has more at stake than Miami, the city in which we are sitting.
913	TUMULTY	But many Republicans argue that this is not a man-made problem.
914	TUMULTY	Senator Sanders, is it possible to move forward on this issue if you do not get a bipartisan consensus, and what would you do?
915	SANDERS	Well, first of all, Karen, when you have Republican candidates for president and in Congress telling you that climate change is a hoax, which is Donald Trump and other candidates' position, what they are really saying is, we don't have the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry.
916	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
917	SANDERS	What candidates are saying is if we stand up to the fossil fuel industry, and transform our energy system away from coal and oil and gas to energy efficiency and wind and solar and geothermal and other sustainable technologies, you know what happens to that Republican who listens to the scientists?
918	SANDERS	On that day, that Republican loses his campaign funding from the Koch brothers and the fossil fuel industry.
919	TUMULTY	So you've just described the problem, but how would you move forward given that this is the situation?
920	SANDERS	The way I would move forward in every other area.
921	SANDERS	And what we are doing in this campaign is fighting not only to become president, but I'm the only candidate who says no president, not Bernie Sanders, can do it all.
922	SANDERS	You know what we need, Karen?
923	SANDERS	We need a political revolution in this country.
924	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
925	SANDERS	And when millions of people stand up and tell the fossil fuel industry that their profits, their short-term profits are less significant than the long-term health of this planet, we will win.
926	SANDERS	That is the way change always takes place.
927	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
928	TUMULTY	Secretary Clinton, can we do this without a bipartisan consensus?
929	TUMULTY	No major environmental legislation has ever passed without bipartisan votes.
930	CLINTON	Well, Karen, first of all, I was proud a number of mayors from Florida campaign for me in South Carolina.
931	CLINTON	I had a chance to talk to some of them about this issue.
932	CLINTON	It is a really serious one.
933	CLINTON	And there isn't much time left to do several things that I will move quickly to do.
934	CLINTON	You can see already what's happening in Miami, particularly in Miami Beach with tides rising.
935	CLINTON	So we do have to invest in resilience and mitigation while we are trying to cut emissions and make up for the fact that this is clearly man-made and man-aggravated.
936	CLINTON	And there are certain things that the president has done through executive action that I will absolutely support.
937	CLINTON	All the Republican say they will, if they're elected, heaven forbid, repeal all of those executive actions.
938	CLINTON	I will maintain them and act on them.
939	CLINTON	The clean power plan is something that Senator Sanders has said he would delay implementing, which makes absolutely no sense.
940	CLINTON	We need to implement all of the president's executive actions and quickly move to make a bridge from coal to natural gas to clean energy.
941	CLINTON	That is the way we will keep the lights on while we are transitioning to a clean energy future.
942	CLINTON	And when I talk about resilience, I think that is an area we can get Republican support on.
943	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
944	SANDERS	Let me be very clear...
945	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
946	CLINTON	Because — because after all — excuse me.
947	SANDERS	I have introduced...
948	CLINTON	Excuse me, excuse me.
949	SANDERS	Did you ask me to speak?
950	CLINTON	After all, there are...
951	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
952	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
953	SANDERS	Madam Secretary, when he asked me to speak...
954	CLINTON	You know, you don't — you know, you don't have to do much more than look at rising insurance rates.
955	RAMOS	Secretary, thank you very much.
956	CLINTON	You know, most of the property in Florida will be at risk in the next 50 years.
957	CLINTON	I think I can get a bipartisan consensus on resilience and then implementing the president's orders until we frankly win back enough seats, take back the Senate, and get back to bipartisan...
958	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
959	RAMOS	Senator Sanders?
960	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
961	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
962	SANDERS	have as much time as she just had.
963	RAMOS	Absolutely.
964	RAMOS	This is your debate.
965	SANDERS	Thank you.
966	SANDERS	Let's be clear.
967	SANDERS	You're looking at the senator who introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation in the history of the United States Senate.
968	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
969	SANDERS	Now, I hope that Secretary Clinton would join me if we are serious about climate change, about imposing a tax on carbon on the fossil fuel industry and making massive investments in energy efficiency and sustainable energy.
970	SANDERS	And by the way, while we are on the subject of energy, I hope you'll join me in ending fracking in the United States of America.
971	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
972	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
973	TUMULTY	Secretary Clinton, Senator Elizabeth Warren — Senator Elizabeth Warren says personnel is policy.
974	TUMULTY	And she says that there is a revolving door between Wall Street and the highest levels of economic policy-making and regulation in Washington.
975	TUMULTY	Three of the last four Treasury secretaries appointed by Democratic presidents had ties to Citigroup.
976	TUMULTY	Do you agree with Elizabeth Warren's criticism that both your husband's administration and President Obama's have relied too heavily on advisers who represent the world view of the big banks?
977	CLINTON	Well, Karen, I do agree that we have to end the revolving door.
978	CLINTON	I strongly support a piece of legislation from Senator Tammy Baldwin that would do just that.
979	CLINTON	And I will be looking for people who will put the interests of consumers first, who will do more to try to make sure Main Street flourishes.
980	CLINTON	And I will very much reach out and ask for advice as to who should be appointed, including to Senator Warren and many of my other former colleagues in the Senate.
981	CLINTON	But I think it's important also to look at what we want to accomplish.
982	CLINTON	You know, in the debates we've had — maybe this is the seventh or so — Senator Sanders is always criticizing the two recent Democratic presidents — President Clinton and President Obama.
983	CLINTON	And that's fine, but I wish he would criticize and join me in criticizing George W. Bush, who I think wrecked the economy and created the conditions for the great recession.
984	CLINTON	You know, at the end of the '90s, we had 23 million new jobs.
985	CLINTON	Incomes went up for everybody.
986	CLINTON	We were talking earlier about what needs to be done for Latinos and African Americans.
987	CLINTON	Well, we were doing it by the end of the '90s.
988	CLINTON	Median family income went up 17 percent.
989	CLINTON	For minorities, it went up even more.
990	CLINTON	Along came the Republicans, trickle-down economics — one of the worst ideas since snake oil — was put back into place.
991	CLINTON	And we ended up with the great recession.
992	CLINTON	President Obama had to rescue the economy.
993	CLINTON	And I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for doing that.
994	TUMULTY	Senator Sanders, your name was mentioned.
995	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
996	SANDERS	Now, let me say this.
997	SANDERS	I gather Secretary Clinton hasn't listened to too many of my speeches.
998	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
999	SANDERS	Or followed my work in the Congress as very few people stood up to George W. Bush whether it was the war in Iraq or any other of his policies.
1000	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1001	SANDERS	Now, when we talk about the policies of the 1990s, I worked closely and supported President Clinton.
1002	SANDERS	And obviously, I have worked very closely in supporting President Obama, who has taken our economy a very long way from where Bush left us.
1003	SANDERS	But when you go back to the 1990s, let's remember, that's when Wall Street deregulation took place.
1004	SALINAS	Thank you senator.
1005	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1006	SANDERS	That's when disastrous trade policies took place.
1007	SALINAS	We're going to break now.
1008	SANDERS	Yes, good things happened, but some dangerous mistakes were made that laid the groundwork for some of the problems we're having with a disappearing middle class today.
1009	SALINAS	Thank you senator.
1010	TUMULTY	Time is up.
1011	TUMULTY	Thank you.
1012	RAMOS	We're going to take a break.
1013	RAMOS	And when we come back, we'll talk about Latin America.
1014	SYSTEM	[ Speaking in Spanish ]
1015	UNKNOWN	When we come back, we'll talk about Latin America.
1016	UNKNOWN	Don't leave.
1017	UNKNOWN	Of course you can follow us on Facebook live.
1018	UNKNOWN	Don't forget.
1019	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
1020	SYSTEM	[ through translator ]
1021	UNKNOWN	We continue with the Democratic debate.
1022	RAMOS	Let's talk about Latin America.
1023	RAMOS	Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders, it will be my welcome to Miami question.
1024	RAMOS	So it goes as follows.
1025	RAMOS	President Barack Obama is going to Cuba in two weeks.
1026	RAMOS	Forty percent of Cuban Americans supporting to uphold — oppose a new White House policy towards Cuba.
1027	RAMOS	If you were president, would you meet with the dissidents in Cuba?
1028	RAMOS	Would you meet with Fidel Castro?
1029	RAMOS	And would you consider Raul Castro a president or a dictator?
1030	RAMOS	Welcome to Miami.
1031	CLINTON	Well, first of all, I supported the president's moves.
1032	CLINTON	I helped to implement some of them leading up to the announcements when I was secretary of state, expanding travel opportunities, remittances.
1033	CLINTON	And I certainly told the president toward the end of my time that I hoped he would be able to move toward diplomatic relations and to make more of an impact by building up the relationship.
1034	CLINTON	And there are no better ambassadors for freedom, democracy and economic opportunity than Cuban Americans.
1035	CLINTON	So the more that we can have that kind of movement back and forth, the more likely we are to be able to move Cuba toward greater freedom, greater respect for rights.
1036	CLINTON	You know, I'm looking forward to following the president's trip.
1037	CLINTON	I do think meeting with dissidents, meeting with people who have been voices, tribunes of freedom and opportunity is important.
1038	CLINTON	The Cuban people deserve to have their human rights respected and upheld, they deserve to be able to move towards democracy where they pick their own leads.
1039	CLINTON	And I think both Castros have to be considered authoritarian and dictatorial because they are not freely chosen by the people that are in Cuba.
1040	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1041	CLINTON	I hope someday there will be leaders who are chosen by the Cuban people, and I hope that democracy will be deeply rooted in Cuban soil and that the people of Cuba will have every opportunity to fulfill their own dreams in their own country.
1042	CLINTON	That is my hope.
1043	SALINAS	Senator Sanders...
1044	RAMOS	On Facebook, by the way, this is the conversation that everybody is having, talking about Cuba.
1045	RAMOS	Senator Sanders.
1046	SANDERS	Look, I understand that not everybody in Florida or in the United States will agree with me, but I think we have got to end the embargo.
1047	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1048	SANDERS	I believe that we should move towards full and normalized political relations with Cuba.
1049	SANDERS	I think at the end of the day, it will be a good thing for the Cuban people.
1050	SANDERS	It will enable them, I think when they see people coming into their country from the United States, move in a more democratic direction, which is what I want to see.
1051	SANDERS	So right — I'm sorry.
1052	SALINAS	Let's continue with another question, Senator, if you don't mind.
1053	SANDERS	Sure.
1054	SALINAS	In 1985, you praised the Sandinista government and you said that Daniel Ortega was an impressive guy.
1055	SALINAS	This is what you said about Fidel Castro.
1056	SALINAS	Let's listen.
1057	SYSTEM	[ begin video clip ]
1058	SANDERS	You may recall way back in, when was it, 1961, they invaded Cuba, and everybody was totally convinced that Castro was the worst guy in the world.
1059	SANDERS	All the Cuban people were going to rise up in rebellion against Fidel Castro.
1060	SANDERS	They forgot that he educated their kids, gave them health care, totally transformed their society.
1061	SYSTEM	[ end video clip ]
1062	SALINAS	In South Florida there are still open wounds among some exiles regarding socialism and communism.
1063	SALINAS	So please explain what is the difference between the socialism that you profess and the socialism in Nicaragua, Cuba and Venezuela.
1064	SANDERS	Well, let me just answer that.
1065	SANDERS	What that was about was saying that the United States was wrong to try to invade Cuba, that the United States was wrong trying to support people to overthrow the Nicaraguan government, that the United States was wrong trying to overthrow in 1954, the government — democratically elected government of Guatemala.
1066	SANDERS	Throughout the history of our relationship with Latin America we've operated under the so-called Monroe Doctrine, and that said the United States had the right do anything that they wanted to do in Latin America.
1067	SANDERS	So I actually went to Nicaragua and I very shortly opposed the Reagan administration's efforts to overthrow that government.
1068	SANDERS	And I strongly opposed earlier Henry Kissinger and the — to overthrow the government of Salvador Aliende in Chile.
1069	SANDERS	I think the United States should be working with governments around the world, not get involved in regime change.
1070	SANDERS	And all of these actions, by the way, in Latin America, brought forth a lot of very strong anti-American sentiments.
1071	SANDERS	That's what that was about.
1072	SALINAS	Senator, in retrospect, have you ever regretted the characterizations that you made of Daniel Ortega and Fidel Castro that way?
1073	SANDERS	I'm sorry.
1074	SANDERS	Please say that...
1075	SALINAS	In retrospect, have you ever regretted the characterizations of Daniel Ortega and Fidel Castro that you made in 1985?
1076	SANDERS	The key issue here was whether the United States should go around overthrowing small Latin American countries.
1077	SANDERS	I think that that was a mistake...
1078	SALINAS	You didn't answer the question.
1079	SANDERS	...both in Nicaragua and Cuba.
1080	SANDERS	Look, let's look at the facts here.
1081	SANDERS	Cuba is, of course, an authoritarian undemocratic country, and I hope very much as soon as possible it becomes a democratic country.
1082	SANDERS	But on the other hand...
1083	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1084	SANDERS	...on the other hands, it would be wrong not to state that in Cuba they have made some good advances in health care.
1085	SANDERS	They are sending doctors all over the world.
1086	SANDERS	They have made some progress in education.
1087	SANDERS	I think by restoring full diplomatic relations with Cuba, it will result in significant improvements to the lives of Cubans and it will help the United States and our business community invest.
1088	SALINAS	Thank you, Senator.
1089	SALINAS	Your time is up on that.
1090	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1091	RAMOS	Secretary, I have a question on Puerto Rico.
1092	RAMOS	Puerto Rico is bankrupt.
1093	RAMOS	It owes more than $70 billion it cannot pay and we have a question from Facebook.
1094	RAMOS	Lian Purvea is asking you the following; I would like to know if during the first 100 days of your presidency, you will help Puerto Rico restructure its public debt and help its economy.
1095	RAMOS	The first 100 days, secretary.
1096	CLINTON	Absolutely, although it happens before I am president if I am so fortunate to be.
1097	CLINTON	I have been calling for months that the Congress must give authority to Puerto Rico to restructure its debts.
1098	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1099	CLINTON	Just like it has enabled states and cities to restructure their debt.
1100	CLINTON	And it's a grave injustice for the Congress, led by the Republicans to be refusing to enact that opportunity within the bankruptcy law.
1101	CLINTON	And what we see in Puerto Rico now is a lot of suffering.
1102	CLINTON	We see schools being closed, we see health care being denied and we see a thousand Puerto Rican families a month moving to the United States, mostly to Florida.
1103	CLINTON	Puerto Ricans are citizen of America.
1104	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1105	CLINTON	They deserve to be treated as citizens and to be given the opportunity to get back on their feet economically.
1106	CLINTON	And I just want to add one thing to the question you were asking Senator Sanders.
1107	CLINTON	I think in that same interview, he praised what he called the revolution of values in Cuba and talked about how people were working for the common good, not for themselves.
1108	CLINTON	I just couldn't disagree more.
1109	CLINTON	You know, if the values are that you oppress people, you disappear people, you imprison people or even kill people for expressing their opinions, for expressing freedom of speech, that is not the kind of revolution of values that I ever want to see anywhere.
1110	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1111	SANDERS	Well, as I said earlier, I don't believe it is the business of the United States government to be overthrowing small countries around the world.
1112	SANDERS	And number two, when you get to Puerto Rico, there's an issue that we have not talked about.
1113	SANDERS	That little island is $73 billion in debt and the government now is paying interest rates of up to 11 percent.
1114	SANDERS	And many of the bonds that they are paying off were purchased by vulture capitalists for 30 cents on the dollar.
1115	SANDERS	And what I have said in talking to the leaders of Puerto Rico, we've got to bring people together.
1116	SANDERS	And it's not the people of Puerto Rico, or the children or the schools.
1117	TUMULTY	Senator, OK
1118	SANDERS	But maybe some of these vulture capitalists who are going to have to lose a little bit of money in this process.
1119	TUMULTY	We need to move on to another topic.
1120	TUMULTY	Secretary Clinton, there is a vacancy on the supreme court at a very crucial moment.
1121	TUMULTY	Among other things, the court is considering the most significant abortion restrictions in a generation.
1122	TUMULTY	So I would like to share with you a question that we got from Facebook from Joshua Dansby, a law student in Washington, D.C. who wants to know what specific forms of qualifications you would look for in a Supreme Court justice?
1123	CLINTON	Well, I think this is one of the most important issues facing our country right now.
1124	CLINTON	And I fully support President Obama's intention under the constitution to nominate a successor to Justice Scalia.
1125	CLINTON	And I believe...
1126	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1127	CLINTON	...I believe no state probably understands this better than Florida.
1128	CLINTON	Because let's remember three words: Bush versus Gore.
1129	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1130	CLINTON	A court took away a presidency.
1131	CLINTON	Now we've got the Republican Congress trying to take away the constitution.
1132	CLINTON	And we should not tolerate that.
1133	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1134	CLINTON	And so from my perspective, it is imperative that we put enormous pressure on the Republicans in the Senate to do their constitutional duty.
1135	CLINTON	Now, obviously you look for people who are not only qualified on paper, but have a heart, have life experience, understand what these decisions mean in the lives of Americans.
1136	CLINTON	And understand the balance of power that their decisions can disrupt one way or the other.
1137	CLINTON	So clearly, I would look for people who believe that Roe v. Wade is settled law and that Citizens United needs to be overturned as quickly as possible.
1138	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1139	TUMULTY	It's time to go to commercial.
1140	TUMULTY	We're going to commercial.
1141	TUMULTY	We'll be right back.

1153	SALINAS	We come back with the Democratic debate, sponsored by Univision, Washington Post and Facebook.
1154	SALINAS	We are reaching the end, asking the candidates to give their last words.
1155	SALINAS	We're coming to the end of this wonderful debate, and it's time for your closing remarks.
1156	SALINAS	Secretary Clinton, you're first.
1157	CLINTON	Well, thank you very much for a lively debate.
1158	CLINTON	And I appreciate greatly all the questions, especially the questions in person from the people here and those coming at us from Facebook.
1159	CLINTON	It just reinforces my strong commitment to do everything I can to break down all the barriers that stand in the way of people living up to their own potential, and of our country doing the same.
1160	CLINTON	So I am going to take on those economic barriers.
1161	CLINTON	I have a plan to create jobs and raise incomes.
1162	CLINTON	I'm going to take on the education barriers that often leave too many children behind even after they have completed schooling.
1163	CLINTON	I'm going to take on the healthcare barriers.
1164	CLINTON	I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that we unite our country.
1165	CLINTON	I will find common ground, just as I have as first lady, as senator and secretary of state.
1166	CLINTON	I will also stand my ground wherever matters of principles are at stake.
1167	CLINTON	I would be honored to have your support in the upcoming primary on Tuesday, and hope to have the great honor of serving you as your president.
1168	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1169	RAMOS	Senator Sanders, your closing remarks.
1170	SANDERS	This has been a wonderful debate, but time being limited, some of the most important issues facing our country have not been asked.
1171	SANDERS	And that is, is it acceptable that in America the top 0.1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.
1172	SANDERS	Is it acceptable that while the average American works longer hours for lower wages, 58 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent.
1173	SANDERS	Is it acceptable that Wall Street and billionaires are spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to buy elections?
1174	SANDERS	Is that democracy or this that oligarchy?
1175	SANDERS	Which is why I believe we've got to overturn Citizens United and move to public funding of elections.
1176	SANDERS	Is it right that in the greatest, wealthiest country in the history of the world, so many of our young people can't even afford to go to college or leave school deeply in debt, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world?
1177	SANDERS	If we stand up, fight back, we can do a lot better.
1178	SANDERS	That's why I'm running for president.
1179	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1180	SALINAS	Secretary and Senator, we want to thank both of you for being here, for joining us tonight.
1181	SALINAS	And, of course, we also want to thank also the wonderful crowd that was here today.
1182	SALINAS	Our audience has been wonderful, and thank you for being here.
1183	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1184	TUMULTY	And on behalf of The Washington Post and Univision and Facebook, we'd like to thank you again for joining us in this debate and also to remind people to get out and vote.
1185	SYSTEM	[ through translator ]
1186	RAMOS	We want to use these last moments, it's very important to go out and vote, remember next Tuesday, March 15th is elections in Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, all these states — in all these states the Hispanic vote is crucial
1187	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
1188	RAMOS	Talk about the importance of Hispanic votes, how in very close races it is the Hispanic vote that can choose the next president of the United States.
1189	RAMOS	This is Hispanic power, but the only way that this can happen is if we all go out and vote.
1190	RAMOS	So you know it perfectly, who does not vote doesn't count.
1191	SYSTEM	[ through translator ]
1192	SALINAS	And as you know, nobody can reach the White House without the Hispanic vote.
1193	SALINAS	Remember, don't let others decide for you.
1194	SALINAS	The power is in your hands, you have to participate, you have to vote.
1195	SALINAS	Thank you for being with us this evening and thank you for trusting in Univision.
1196	SALINAS	Good evening.
1197	RAMOS	Good evening.
