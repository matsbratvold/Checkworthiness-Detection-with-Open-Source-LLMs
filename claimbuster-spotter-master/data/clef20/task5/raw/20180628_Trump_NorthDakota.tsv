1	Donald Trump	Wow.
2	Donald Trump	Oh, hello, Fargo.
3	Donald Trump	Hi, Fargo.
4	Donald Trump	We love you, Fargo.
5	Donald Trump	What a place.
6	Donald Trump	What a place.
7	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
8	Donald Trump	This is an honor.
9	Donald Trump	You know, I wish we could have had this stage back about 100 yards.
10	Donald Trump	You'd see how many people.
11	Donald Trump	This place is packed.
12	Donald Trump	This place is packed.
13	Donald Trump	The only thing more packed is outside, trying to get in.
14	Donald Trump	They're having a hard time.
15	Donald Trump	They can't get in.
16	Donald Trump	It's full.
17	Donald Trump	You know, we had the chance for a 24,000-seat arena.
18	Donald Trump	And we should have taken it.
19	Donald Trump	The problem is, if we had two empty seats, we didn't quite get there, which will always happen, they will say, "He didn't fill up the arena.
20	Donald Trump	He didn't fill it up."
21	Donald Trump	Right.
22	Donald Trump	That's what they'll say.
23	Donald Trump	He didn't fill that arena up.
24	Donald Trump	Twenty-four thousand seats.
25	Donald Trump	No, we would have filled it up very easily, in retrospect, but that's OK.
26	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
27	Donald Trump	I am thrilled to be here in the great state of North Dakota with so many hard-working American patriots.
28	Donald Trump	Right?
29	Donald Trump	And I want to congratulate -- right?
30	Donald Trump	We want to do this.
31	Donald Trump	You know what I'm going to say.
32	Donald Trump	I want to congratulate the North Dakota State Bison.
33	Donald Trump	I shouldn't tell you this.
34	Donald Trump	I shouldn't tell you this, but when I was coming out, they were talking about Bison.
35	Donald Trump	I said, "I thought there was an s." They said, "It is.
36	Donald Trump	But it's pronounced Bizon."
37	Donald Trump	So, we didn't want to get that wrong, right?
38	Donald Trump	But that is some -- that is some great national championship team.
39	Donald Trump	That's a great group of winners.
40	Donald Trump	Winners.
41	Donald Trump	We're honored to be joined by many of your wonderful North Dakota leaders.
42	Donald Trump	Your governor, and a great guy, Doug Burgum, and his wife, First Lady of North Dakota, Kathryn Burgum.
43	Donald Trump	Where are you, Governor?
44	Donald Trump	Where are you?
45	Donald Trump	Thank you, Governor.
46	Donald Trump	Your former governor, Ed Schafer.
47	Donald Trump	Ed.
48	Donald Trump	Nice guy.
49	Donald Trump	A friend of mine, who employs a lot of people, a very successful guy.
50	Donald Trump	He puts a straw in the ground and oil comes out.
51	Donald Trump	These big companies, they go out, they spend billions looking for oil.
52	Donald Trump	They don't find anything.
53	Donald Trump	Harold Hamm.
54	Donald Trump	Where's Harold?
55	Donald Trump	Where is Harold?
56	Donald Trump	If I ever want to find oil, I'm going to call Harold.
57	Donald Trump	Here's a straw, Harold.
58	Donald Trump	North Dakota Republican Party Chairman, great guy, really helpful, Rick Berg.
59	Donald Trump	Thank you, Rick.
60	Donald Trump	A man who is so incredibly helpful, to me and to you, and to everybody.
61	Donald Trump	A special person who works so hard.
62	Donald Trump	I call him all-action, no-talk, that's -- don't we like that?
63	Donald Trump	All-action...
64	Donald Trump	Senator John Hoeven.
65	Donald Trump	He is fantastic.
66	Donald Trump	And I also want to thank Kelly Armstrong, who's running for Congress.
67	Donald Trump	He's going to win.
68	Donald Trump	And Kelly, thank you very much.
69	Donald Trump	Thank you.
70	Donald Trump	Good guy.
71	Donald Trump	We also have a couple of big supporters.
72	Donald Trump	Do you ever see this guy with the pillows on Fox?
73	Donald Trump	John?
74	Donald Trump	MyPillow guy.
75	Donald Trump	Mike Liddell.
76	Donald Trump	Where is Mike?
77	Donald Trump	He is the greatest.
78	Donald Trump	I have never seen so many ads for so long.
79	Donald Trump	And you know what?
80	Donald Trump	I think he gets them for, like, peanuts.
81	Donald Trump	First of all, he does make a great product.
82	Donald Trump	Great pillows.
83	Donald Trump	I actually use them, believe it or not.
84	Donald Trump	But he's been -- he's been a supporter from day one.
85	Donald Trump	And I said, "You know, I want you to be my ad buyer."
86	Donald Trump	Because I guarantee you, he makes great deals.
87	Donald Trump	So, I haven't asked him yet.
88	Donald Trump	Will you be my ad buyer, please, Mike?
89	Donald Trump	The MyPillow guy.
90	Donald Trump	Thank you.
91	Donald Trump	And he's been with us right from the beginning.
92	Donald Trump	Along with a lot of other folks, actually.
93	Donald Trump	We've had a great journey together, and we are making progress like nobody thought possible.
94	Donald Trump	Finally, the person we are all here tonight to support, a special person, an incredible person, the next United States Senator from the great state of North Dakota, Kevin Cramer.
95	Donald Trump	Kevin, come out.
96	Donald Trump	Good guy.
97	Kevin Cramer	Thank you.
98	Kevin Cramer	Thank you.
99	Kevin Cramer	Thank you, Mr. President.
100	Kevin Cramer	All I can say is, Mr. President, on behalf of all of the thousands of people in this arena, and the tens of thousands outside of this arena, who live in flyover country, thank you for not forgetting us.
101	Kevin Cramer	And for all the farmers, and the manufacturers, and the families, and the energy workers, thank you for rolling back all of those regulations so they can not only keep their jobs but create more jobs.
102	Kevin Cramer	And, Mr. President, on behalf of the middle-class working families represented in this room and throughout the heartland, thank you for cutting their taxes, so they can keep more of their hard-earned money right here.
103	Kevin Cramer	And, Mr. President, on behalf of the most vulnerable forgotten people, the unborn babies, thank you for standing for life.
104	Kevin Cramer	Thank you.
105	Kevin Cramer	And on these very important North Dakota values, you'll never have to wonder where I'll be, because I'll always be with them and with you, 100 percent of the time.
106	Kevin Cramer	Thank you.
107	Kevin Cramer	God bless you.
108	Kevin Cramer	Welcome to North Dakota.
109	Audience	USA!
110	Audience	USA!
111	Audience	USA!
112	Donald Trump	I have got to tell you, that's pretty good.
113	Donald Trump	That's pretty good.
114	Donald Trump	He did good.
115	Donald Trump	He loves you.
116	Donald Trump	I will tell you that.
117	Donald Trump	He loves this state, loves the people.
118	Donald Trump	And we need Kevin Cramer to replace liberal Democrat Heidi Heitkamp in the Senate.
119	Donald Trump	Going to happen.
120	Donald Trump	It's going to happen.
121	Donald Trump	When Heidi ran for office, she promised to be an independent vote for the people of North Dakota.
122	Donald Trump	Instead, she went to Washington and immediately joined Chuck.
123	Donald Trump	You know who Chuck is.
124	Donald Trump	And Nancy.
125	Donald Trump	And now they have a new leader.
126	Donald Trump	Who's the new leader?
127	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
128	Donald Trump	Maxine Waters is their new leader.
129	SYSTEM	[Booing]
130	Donald Trump	Maxine Waters.
131	Donald Trump	I think she's taking over.
132	Donald Trump	You know, they say, took.
133	Donald Trump	I never believed I was taking over the Republican Party.
134	Donald Trump	They say that to cause problems.
135	Donald Trump	But Maxine Waters is taking over the Democrat Party, so.
136	Donald Trump	Heidi voted no on the Obamacare repeal.
137	Donald Trump	And, by the way, it was done.
138	Donald Trump	It was done.
139	Donald Trump	Unfortunately, she wouldn't vote.
140	Donald Trump	And another person didn't vote.
141	Donald Trump	We had it done.
142	Donald Trump	Another person campaigned for eight years.
143	Donald Trump	Repeal and replace.
144	Donald Trump	And we were a little surprised when the thumb went down.
145	Donald Trump	But we're doing very well.
146	Donald Trump	You see what's happening.
147	Donald Trump	We're coming up with incredible plans.
148	Donald Trump	We've gotten rid of the individual mandate, which is terrible.
149	Donald Trump	It's been gutted.
150	Donald Trump	But remember this.
151	Donald Trump	Individual mandate, where you have the privilege of paying a lot of money for the second privilege of not having to pay for not getting health care.
152	Donald Trump	What kind of a deal is that?
153	Donald Trump	So, you pay in order to not to have to pay, because you don't want the health care because it was no good anyway.
154	Donald Trump	So, we have, though our Secretary of Labor, Alex Acosta, we just came out with the association plan, which is phenomenal.
155	Donald Trump	Millions and millions of people are signing up.
156	Donald Trump	And we're coming out with another plan with Alex Azar.
157	Donald Trump	We are coming out with that plan in two weeks.
158	Donald Trump	We are coming out with so many health care plans.
159	Donald Trump	It is so much better than anything you've ever seen before.
160	Donald Trump	Competitive.
161	Donald Trump	And Obamacare is essentially dead.
162	Donald Trump	I would have been happier with a nice yes vote instead of a no vote, but that's OK. We're doing great.
163	Donald Trump	And probably we wouldn't have come up with these two other plans.
164	Donald Trump	And it's actually three, now, other plans if we didn't.
165	Donald Trump	You know, sometimes you work under pressure, and you do better, right?
166	Donald Trump	I think most of the people in this room, under pressure, you end up doing better.
167	Donald Trump	There are those people.
168	Donald Trump	We want to know those people.
169	Donald Trump	Heidi voted no on our massive tax cuts for North Dakota families.
170	Donald Trump	She voted "no."
171	SYSTEM	[Booing]
172	Donald Trump	Not one Democrat voted to cut your taxes.
173	Donald Trump	And the other day Nancy Pelosi said we have to raise your taxes.
174	Donald Trump	What's that all about?
175	Donald Trump	She wants to raise your taxes.
176	Donald Trump	Heidi voted no on legislation to stop late term abortions.
177	SYSTEM	[Booing]
178	Donald Trump	Heidi voted in favor of the deadly, very, very dangerous, horrible sanctuary cities.
179	SYSTEM	[Booing]
180	Donald Trump	You need a senator who doesn't just talk like they're from North Dakota but votes like they're from North Dakota.
181	Donald Trump	That's what you need.
182	Donald Trump	And that is Kevin Cramer.
183	Donald Trump	So, a vote for any Democrat is November is a vote for Schumer, Pelosi, and Maxine.
184	SYSTEM	[Booing]
185	Donald Trump	Maxine.
186	Donald Trump	She's a beauty.
187	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
188	Donald Trump	I mean, she practically was telling people the other day to assault.
189	Donald Trump	Can you imagine if I said the things she said?
190	Donald Trump	We demand that he immediately drop out of the race.
191	Donald Trump	Can you imagine, seriously, if I said that, or somebody else said that?
192	Donald Trump	Horrible, what she said.
193	Donald Trump	Now they want to censure her.
194	Donald Trump	Let's see where that goes, folks.
195	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
196	Donald Trump	Her own party was talking about censure.
197	Donald Trump	Let's see where that goes.
198	Donald Trump	Heidi was also against us from the very beginning of the travel ban, a common-sense policy to improve our vetting and our national security.
199	Donald Trump	And I'm proud to report that, just yesterday, the Supreme Court upheld the travel ban...... and our authority to keep America safe.
200	Audience	USA!
201	Audience	USA!
202	Audience	USA!
203	Donald Trump	And, by the way -- by the way, a lot of media back here.
204	SYSTEM	[Booing]
205	Donald Trump	If crooked Hillary would have won this election, and if she came here, which is about a zero percent change, after the election,... she'd have 200 people in a conference room in a small hotel.
206	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
207	Donald Trump	You know, the saddest thing, we, I, we're making them rich.
208	Donald Trump	They never had ratings like this.
209	Donald Trump	You know, when the NFL is down 20 percent, it's the flag.
210	Donald Trump	But it's also the fact that everybody is watching us on the different cable networks.
211	Donald Trump	Because, frankly, they find this more exciting than the NFL, and a hell of a lot more dangerous, right?
212	Donald Trump	And is there any better place to be on a nice, beautiful evening in North Dakota than at a Trump rally, right?
213	Donald Trump	We're having a good time.
214	Donald Trump	And I wish those cameras would circle the room to see how many thousands of people are here, because, you know, on the screen I look -- and all you see are those few beautiful, wonderful people -- I don't know who the hell I -- but you've got a nice group over there.
215	Donald Trump	I know you have Mike and some others.
216	Donald Trump	They're going to be so famous.
217	Donald Trump	But you see, like, that little group.
218	Donald Trump	That's all you see on camera.
219	Donald Trump	Would you please circle the room for the few honest...
220	Donald Trump	Please circle.
221	Audience	Trump!
222	Audience	Trump!
223	Audience	Trump!
224	Audience	USA!
225	Audience	USA!
226	Audience	USA!
227	Donald Trump	No, I just looked at the screen, and I said to my people, "How many people are here?"
228	Donald Trump	They said, "Six thousand in the arena, but we're going to be -- have to, unfortunately, walk 15,000 or 18,000 people that couldn't get in."
229	Donald Trump	I said, "You've got to be kidding, because on the screen it looks like there's exactly 30 people.
230	Donald Trump	What the hell is this?
231	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
232	Donald Trump	The late, great, Cecil B. DeMille would not have set it up this way, I will tell you.
233	Donald Trump	The travel ban ruling underscores just how critical it is to confirm judges who will support our Constitution, our great, great Constitution.
234	Donald Trump	Justice Anthony Kennedy, a very special guy, also just announced a little while ago his retirement from the United States Supreme Court.
235	Donald Trump	Great man.
236	Donald Trump	And I'm very honored that he chose to do it during my term in office, because he felt confident in me to make the right choice and carry on his great legacy.
237	Donald Trump	That's why he did it.
238	Donald Trump	And I'd like to take a moment to show our great appreciation for Justice Kennedy's lifetime of distinguished service.
239	Donald Trump	Terrific man.
240	Donald Trump	Service to our nation, and to the cause of liberty.
241	Donald Trump	We were thrilled to appoint one of Kennedy's former clerks to the Supreme Court.
242	Donald Trump	Did you ever hear of Justice Neil Gorsuch?
243	Donald Trump	He's doing great.
244	Donald Trump	He's a star.
245	Donald Trump	And Justice Kennedy is a star.
246	Donald Trump	And we appreciate it.
247	Donald Trump	We really have to take our hats off to Justice Kennedy.
248	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
249	Donald Trump	And remember this.
250	Donald Trump	So, we have a pick to come up.
251	Donald Trump	We have to pick a great one.
252	Donald Trump	We have to pick one that's going to be there for 40 years, 45 years.
253	Audience	Yeah.
254	Donald Trump	We need intellect.
255	Donald Trump	We need so many things to go.
256	Donald Trump	You know, there's so many elements go into the making of a great Justice of the Supreme Court.
257	Donald Trump	You've got to hit every one of them.
258	Donald Trump	Heidi will vote no to any pick we make for the Supreme Court.
259	Donald Trump	She will be told to do so.
260	Donald Trump	Now, maybe, because of this, she'll be forced to vote yes.
261	Donald Trump	Who knows?
262	Donald Trump	But I will tell you she'll vote no the day after the election on everything.
263	Donald Trump	Justice Kennedy's retirement makes the issue of Senate control one of the vital issues of our time.
264	Donald Trump	The most important thing we can do. Democrats want judges who will rewrite the Constitution any way they want to do it, and take away your Second Amendment, erase your borders...
265	SYSTEM	[Booing]
266	Donald Trump	... throw open the jailhouse doors and destroy your freedoms.
267	SYSTEM	[Booing]
268	Donald Trump	We must elect more Republicans.
269	Donald Trump	We have to do that.
270	Donald Trump	And the problem is, in the Senate, we have 51.
271	Donald Trump	We don't have enough.
272	Donald Trump	We lose one.
273	Donald Trump	If somebody gets a bad cold, let's assume they come in for a cold, but let's assume it's worse than that.
274	Donald Trump	It's a very tough situation.
275	Donald Trump	We need more Republicans, especially in the Senate.
276	Donald Trump	We have to hold the House, and maybe even increase it.
277	Donald Trump	And I think we'll be able to do it.
278	Donald Trump	They keep talking about this blue wave.
279	Donald Trump	Their blue wave is really sputtering pretty badly.
280	Donald Trump	The red wave is happening.
281	Donald Trump	Just look what happened last night.
282	Donald Trump	Famous people.
283	Donald Trump	Oh, they're going to be so famous tomorrow.
284	Donald Trump	You were in that little group of people behind the president.
285	Donald Trump	Yeah.
286	Donald Trump	They're going to be famous people, those people.
287	Donald Trump	You have a better location, but they're going to be famous.
288	Donald Trump	Republicans want strong borders and no crime.
289	Donald Trump	Very simple.
290	Donald Trump	Not complex.
291	Donald Trump	Democrats want open borders and crime, crime, crime happens automatically when you have those open borders.
292	SYSTEM	[Booing]
293	Donald Trump	The Democrats want to let the country be overrun.
294	Donald Trump	Just take a look at what's going on.
295	Donald Trump	Everybody comes in, including the vile gang, MS-13, which Nancy Pelosi has gone out and wants to protect, OK?
296	Donald Trump	We don't want to protect them.
297	Donald Trump	Do you remember two weeks ago, you remember that.
298	Donald Trump	Republicans love our military.
299	Donald Trump	They love our vets and our police.
300	Donald Trump	The Democrats are always fighting against funding for the military, and funding for law enforcement.
301	Donald Trump	Figure that one out.
302	Donald Trump	Democrats are now launching vicious smears against our incredible ICE officers and our Border Patrol agents.
303	Donald Trump	Every single day the men and women of ICE and the CBP work long hours in the most dangerous conditions you can imagine, to defend our families, and to defend our communities, and to defend our borders, and defend us.
304	Donald Trump	And I'll tell you what.
305	Donald Trump	You know, far fewer people are coming through, as much as I complain, coming through our southern border.
306	Donald Trump	And now it's getting worse because we have so much opportunity here.
307	Donald Trump	We have done so well.
308	Donald Trump	And we want people to come into our country.
309	Donald Trump	But we want them to come into our country based on merit.
310	Donald Trump	Merit.
311	Donald Trump	Not picked out of a jar.
312	Donald Trump	And we're sending MS-13 out by the thousands.
313	Donald Trump	By the thousands.
314	Donald Trump	We're liberating towns in Long Island.
315	Donald Trump	We are sending MS-13 out.
316	Donald Trump	You know, our ICE officers, they're tough.
317	Donald Trump	I have got to say it.
318	Donald Trump	It's not nice.
319	Donald Trump	But they're mean.
320	Donald Trump	But they have heart.
321	Donald Trump	But they go into these towns, in Long Island.
322	Donald Trump	I grew up in Long Island, right next to Long Island.
323	Donald Trump	And these are towns that I know all my life.
324	Donald Trump	They're being liberated, like a foreign power has taken over the towns.
325	Donald Trump	Our ICE goes in there.
326	Donald Trump	They grab 'em by the neck.
327	Donald Trump	They throw 'em in the paddy wagon.
328	Donald Trump	We get 'em the hell out of our country.
329	Donald Trump	And the Democrats are constantly complaining that we're too rough on ICE.
330	Donald Trump	Do you believe it?
331	Donald Trump	Do you see what they do?
332	Donald Trump	Bing, bing.
333	Donald Trump	Right?
334	Donald Trump	You see what they're doing?
335	Donald Trump	No, but do you see what they're doing?
336	Donald Trump	They don't need guns.
337	Donald Trump	They like knives, because knives are much more painful.
338	Donald Trump	They cut people up in small pieces.
339	Donald Trump	Beautiful young women, walking home from school.
340	Donald Trump	And the Democrats complain that we're treating them too rough.
341	Donald Trump	We're getting them the hell out, as I said, by the thousands.
342	Donald Trump	Right?
343	Donald Trump	Just days ago, a brave border agent was shot multiple times while protecting our border.
344	Donald Trump	Every day, border agents are keeping drugs, crime, and gangs from entering our country.
345	Donald Trump	We're going to get that wall built.
346	Donald Trump	We've already started it.
347	Donald Trump	$1.6 billion.
348	Donald Trump	We're getting the wall built.
349	Audience	Build that wall!
350	Audience	Build that wall!
351	Audience	Build that wall!
352	Donald Trump	It's already begun, and it's beautiful.
353	Donald Trump	And I'll tell you what, they may not want to talk about it in California, but those people in San Diego are very happy with Donald Trump.
354	Donald Trump	I'm building that wall, and they are so happy.
355	Donald Trump	They are so happy.
356	Donald Trump	In recent days, we've heard of shameless attacks on these courageous law enforcement officers.
357	Donald Trump	Extremist Democrat politicians have called for the complete elimination of ICE.
358	Donald Trump	We don't want ICE anymore.
359	Donald Trump	You know what would happen to parts of our country?
360	Donald Trump	It would be overrun with the worst criminal elements you have ever seen.
361	Donald Trump	Left-wing activists are trying to block ICE officers from doing their jobs, and publicly posting their home addresses, putting these incredible people and their families in harm's way.
362	SYSTEM	[Booing]
363	Donald Trump	These radical Democrat protesters, they really want anarchy.
364	Donald Trump	But the only response they will find from our government is very strong law and order.
365	Donald Trump	We will not tolerate attacks on our law enforcement.
366	Donald Trump	We will protect our law enforcement, like they protect us.
367	Donald Trump	We will always stand proudly with our brave heroes of ICE, the Border Patrol, the sheriffs, the police, yes, the firemen.
368	Donald Trump	The foremen sometimes are under attack, if you can believe it.
369	Donald Trump	The firemen.
370	Donald Trump	These are great people.
371	Donald Trump	And we have their backs.
372	Donald Trump	Thanks to Republican leadership, America is winning again, and America is being respected again all over the world.
373	Donald Trump	We're respected again.
374	Donald Trump	All over the world, we're respected again.
375	Donald Trump	You know, all those red hats and the white hats, Make America Great Again.
376	Donald Trump	Right?
377	Donald Trump	Make America Great Again.
378	Donald Trump	And that's what we're doing.
379	Donald Trump	And what are we going -- what are we going to say in two and a half years for the next campaign?
380	Donald Trump	It's called Keep America Great, exclamation point.
381	Donald Trump	Exclamation point.
382	Donald Trump	Keep America Great!
383	Donald Trump	We gained $7 trillion in value, trillion with a "t".
384	Donald Trump	Trillion.
385	Donald Trump	I have wealthy friends, like Harold Hamm.
386	Donald Trump	They don't even know what a trillion represents.
387	Donald Trump	I say, "Harold, how many billion are in a trillion?"
388	Donald Trump	And I'm not sure that Harold could answer that.
389	Donald Trump	But I'll tell you what.
390	Donald Trump	We've gained tremendous worth, economic worth, and other worth, more important worth.
391	Donald Trump	We're respected again, we're putting America first, we're making great trade deals.
392	Donald Trump	$7 trillion.
393	Donald Trump	Think of what that it.
394	Donald Trump	And people don't realize this.
395	Donald Trump	And we're going to get along with China.
396	Donald Trump	And we're going to get along with the European Union, which has barriers from our farmers and our people, selling product into the European Union.
397	Donald Trump	Last year, with the European Union, and we love the European Union.
398	Donald Trump	We love the countries of the European Union.
399	Donald Trump	But the European Union, of course, was set up to take advantage of the United States, to attack our piggy bank, right?
400	Donald Trump	And you know what, we can't let that happen.
401	Donald Trump	Last year, with the European Union, we lost $151 billion on trade.
402	Donald Trump	We had a trade deficit of $151 billion, because they send the Mercedes in.
403	Donald Trump	They send the BMWs in.
404	Donald Trump	They send their products in.
405	Donald Trump	We send things to them, they say, "No, thank you.
406	Donald Trump	We don't take your product."
407	Donald Trump	That's not the way it works.
408	Donald Trump	And for all those free traders out there, that's not free trade.
409	Donald Trump	That's stupid trade.
410	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
411	Donald Trump	That's stupid trade.
412	Donald Trump	So -- so, I said to them, as the great Harold Hamm would say, because to him it's a natural thing, to some of the people in here it's a nat -- because I know some of the people.
413	Donald Trump	They're great business people.
414	Donald Trump	I said to the, very simply, "Look.
415	Donald Trump	If you treat us that way, and if you don't take down your barriers" -- they call them trade -- you know what they call them.
416	Donald Trump	Non-monetary barriers.
417	Donald Trump	They're barriers.
418	Donald Trump	Just like charging a big tariff, they charge us many times tariff.
419	Donald Trump	If we send them a car which they don't want, and they practically don't take, but on the assumption it got through, they charge us many, many times what we charge them.
420	Donald Trump	And I said, "Look.
421	Donald Trump	If you're not going to treat us fairly, if you're not going to treat our workers, our companies, our farmers fairly, if you're not going to take our farm products like we take your farm products, then we're going to tax all of those beautiful Mercedes Benzes that are coming in, and we're going to tax BMWs that are coming in..."
422	Donald Trump	... and we're already taxing, through tariffs, their steel and their aluminum.
423	Donald Trump	And, by the way, do you see what's happening with our steel industry in the last four months?
424	Donald Trump	It's booming again, folks.
425	Donald Trump	It's booming.
426	Donald Trump	United States Steel is opening up six plants through expansion and new.
427	Donald Trump	I was in South Carolina the other night where, by the way, a great candidate won very easily.
428	Donald Trump	You know, our track record is extraordinarily good, right?
429	Donald Trump	That's why I'm here, for Kevin, that's why.
430	Donald Trump	That's why I'm here.
431	Donald Trump	But they just announced the day I get there, they have a steel company called Georgetown.
432	Donald Trump	It's been closed for four years.
433	Donald Trump	They announced the day before I got to South Carolina that Georgetown Steel is reopening and hiring 600 people.
434	Donald Trump	Not so complicated.
435	Donald Trump	We put tariffs on solar panels because China was flooding the market and it wasn't good stuff.
436	Donald Trump	We had 32 plants.
437	Donald Trump	Two were open and they were barely breathing.
438	Donald Trump	They were mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
439	Donald Trump	We put a 30 percent tax on solar panels coming into the United States.
440	Donald Trump	Now, those two plants are doing great.
441	Donald Trump	And they're talking about opening at least 10, 11, or 12, and they'll probably have them all open very soon.
442	Donald Trump	And they're going to make high quality panels.
443	Donald Trump	And a lot of jobs.
444	Donald Trump	Same thing with washing machines.
445	Donald Trump	Sounds sort of tacky.
446	Donald Trump	Washing machines.
447	Donald Trump	Big business.
448	Donald Trump	They were dumping, different countries -- I don't even want to tell you this country because I actually like this country, but, you know, they all -- sometimes our worst enemies are our so-called friends or allies, right?
449	Donald Trump	But they were dumping washing machines.
450	Donald Trump	We put a big tariff on, 30 percent.
451	Donald Trump	We're now making washing machines back in our country.
452	Donald Trump	But what else are we doing?
453	Donald Trump	Think of it.
454	Donald Trump	Just think, because you never hear this from the fake news.
455	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
456	Donald Trump	What else are we doing?
457	Donald Trump	No, what else?
458	Donald Trump	We're creating jobs, number one.
459	Donald Trump	And we're taking in billions and billions of dollars into our coffers.
460	Donald Trump	You know, there was a time -- there was a time when we had tariffs, because you had presidents like President McKinley and Roosevelt and others.
461	Donald Trump	Roosevelt, one, who liked the idea of foreign countries, when they come in and want to take our wealth, they have to pay for it.
462	Donald Trump	They don't take it.
463	Donald Trump	On top of everything else, so they take our wealth, and we even protect them with our military.
464	Donald Trump	We protect everybody.
465	Donald Trump	So, we get it every which way.
466	Donald Trump	So, we want to just tell those people, number one, we created a lot of jobs.
467	Donald Trump	Number two, what's happening is we're taking in billions and billions -- look at the steel.
468	Donald Trump	We have a 25 percent tariff.
469	Donald Trump	We're taking in billions of dollars, creating jobs, and -- and, you know what?
470	Donald Trump	Even if it wasn't perfect, we need a steel industry.
471	Donald Trump	We were going to have no steel plants.
472	Donald Trump	If something ever happened -- if something ever happened, you know what I'm talking about, and we needed steel to make that something, we wouldn't be able to make steel.
473	Donald Trump	We need -- you know, there are some industries, steel and aluminum, we have got to have it.
474	Donald Trump	So, we have jobs, we have a vibrant industry, in a short -- the head of United States Steel called me the other day.
475	Donald Trump	And he said, "Mr. President, I'd like to thank you.
476	Donald Trump	I have never seen anything like it.
477	Donald Trump	We haven't opened up a new plant in 32 years.
478	Donald Trump	And now we're opening up seven of them.
479	Donald Trump	Six of them extensions.
480	Donald Trump	We're going to build a new one."
481	Donald Trump	And that's just one company.
482	Donald Trump	The Heritage Foundation reported that in just the first 500 days of our presidency -- not my presidency.
483	Donald Trump	It's our presidency, let's face it.
484	Donald Trump	It's not my presidency.
485	Donald Trump	You're the one that did it.
486	Donald Trump	You're the one that did it.
487	Donald Trump	Although I've been a good student.
488	Donald Trump	I told John, and I told the whole group.
489	Donald Trump	We had a whole group of politicians before.
490	Donald Trump	And, you know, some of them have been congressmen, like, for 25, 30 years.
491	Donald Trump	And they're asking me questions about politics.
492	Donald Trump	I said, "I've only been doing this for two and half years.
493	Donald Trump	Don't ask me a question like that."
494	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
495	Donald Trump	But we've been good students, haven't we, altogether?
496	Donald Trump	Haven't we been good students?
497	Donald Trump	But the Heritage Foundation came out with a report, and this was as of two months ago.
498	Donald Trump	We've already implemented 64 percent of our top agenda items.
499	Donald Trump	And that's at a much faster pace than even Ronald Reagan.
500	Donald Trump	That's pretty good, right?
501	Donald Trump	And you don't hear this from the fake news.
502	Donald Trump	We've created 3.4 million new jobs since election day, 3.4.
503	Donald Trump	Unemployment -- think of this one.
504	Donald Trump	Unemployment claims are at a 45-year low, and it's going to 63, I believe, probably, next month.
505	Donald Trump	African-American unemployment is at its lowest level in the history of our country.
506	Donald Trump	Hispanic-American unemployment also is at the lowest point in the history of our country.
507	Donald Trump	Unemployment among women, women... remember, we were going to do so poorly with women.
508	Donald Trump	Look at all the women here tonight.
509	Donald Trump	Women for Trump.
510	Donald Trump	They never take those cameras off my face.
511	Donald Trump	Look at all the women.
512	Donald Trump	Remember we were going to do so poorly with women.
513	Donald Trump	We did great with the women.
514	Donald Trump	If -- I wouldn't be standing...
515	Donald Trump	My wife told me, she said, "You're going to do great with the women."
516	Donald Trump	It's hard to believe it, though, with the kind of press we get.
517	Donald Trump	Do you agree?
518	Donald Trump	But, you know what?
519	Donald Trump	They are so smart.
520	Donald Trump	And when they hear those numbers, they're happy.
521	Donald Trump	And when you hear the numbers -- I used to go into arenas, and I'd read the horrible statistics on crime and education, and how badly people are being treated in Hispanic communities, in African-American communities.
522	Donald Trump	And you remember, I'd go and I'd say, "You've been voting for Democrats for 100 years.
523	Donald Trump	You have these horrible"-- look at my friends, right there.
524	Donald Trump	Great guys.
525	Donald Trump	My friends.
526	Donald Trump	Thank you.
527	Donald Trump	You've had these horrible, horrible statistics for years on crime and the educational abuse, and all of the things.
528	Donald Trump	And I went in, and I'm reading them, point after point, and I'm seeing, and I'm -- I looked out at the audience.
529	Donald Trump	For 100 years they were with Democrats.
530	Donald Trump	The Democrats felt they had automatic votes.
531	Donald Trump	And I said to them, "What the hell do you have to lose?
532	Donald Trump	Vote for me.
533	Donald Trump	What do you have to lose?
534	Donald Trump	What do you have to lose?
535	Donald Trump	And I came off the stage.
536	Donald Trump	I'll never forget it.
537	Donald Trump	The first time I just said it.
538	Donald Trump	I just said it.
539	Donald Trump	I didn't care.
540	Donald Trump	I -- honestly, I want to say what's right.
541	Donald Trump	I don't care.
542	Donald Trump	I came off the stage and my political people said, "Sir, that's a horrible thing."
543	Donald Trump	What's a horrible thing?
544	Donald Trump	When you say, 'what the hell do you have to lose?'
545	Donald Trump	That's a horrible thing.
546	Donald Trump	I said, "But it's true.
547	Donald Trump	What the hell do you have to lose?"
548	Donald Trump	And now, I just said African-American unemployment is at the lowest level in history.
549	Donald Trump	Very, very good. Thank you,
550	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
551	Donald Trump	.
552	Donald Trump	Thank you. Thank you,
553	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
554	Donald Trump	.
555	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
556	Donald Trump	Thank you.
557	Donald Trump	So, we keep going, and we keep striving.
558	Donald Trump	And when it's all over, nobody's done the job that we've all done.
559	Donald Trump	Wages are rising.
560	Donald Trump	You know, for those of you that were with the campaign, which I think was probably about 130 percent of you...
561	Donald Trump	... you would hear me talking about wages.
562	Donald Trump	Where a person would have a job 21 years ago, 19 years ago from two years, where we were doing the campaign.
563	Donald Trump	And they made more money 19 years ago, relatively speaking, by far, than they made two years ago.
564	Donald Trump	And, actually, one year ago.
565	Donald Trump	Their wages were going along, and they had one job.
566	Donald Trump	And now they'd have two and three jobs.
567	Donald Trump	They'd be working much harder and making much less money.
568	Donald Trump	And now, for the first time in 22 years, wages are rising again.
569	Donald Trump	And even more importantly than that is, you have a choice of jobs.
570	Donald Trump	It's like the V.A.
571	Donald Trump	We approved choice.
572	Donald Trump	They've been trying to do it for 45 years.
573	Donald Trump	Choice.
574	Donald Trump	You have choice in a job.
575	Donald Trump	But the vets -- and you have great vets in North Dakota.
576	Donald Trump	Vets, vets, vets.
577	Donald Trump	So, remember, I used to say about the vets -- and I wasn't a great student of the vets, but I'd read where the vets would be online for 13 days, 18 days, three weeks, seven days.
578	Donald Trump	And they'd start off, and they wouldn't be in bad shape.
579	Donald Trump	And sometimes it would take so long before seeing a doctor that they would be terminally ill.
580	Donald Trump	Things that could have been taken care of.
581	Donald Trump	And I said, without knowing anything -- I thought it was the most brilliant policy I've ever heard.
582	Donald Trump	I said, "Why don't they just go to a doctor, local, that's looking for the business, that would be a very good doctor.
583	Donald Trump	We'll specify certain great doctors.
584	Donald Trump	Go to a doctor.
585	Donald Trump	Be taken care of.
586	Donald Trump	And we will pay the bill, and it will be much less expensive, and you'll be all set, right?"
587	Donald Trump	Right?
588	Donald Trump	And I thought that was so brilliant.
589	Donald Trump	I said, "Oh, I am so smart.
590	Donald Trump	I am the smartest person."
591	Donald Trump	My uncle was a great professor at MIT for 40 years.
592	Donald Trump	Can you believe?
593	Donald Trump	Forty years.
594	Donald Trump	I said, "But I'm smarter than him.
595	Donald Trump	I'm smarter than anybody."
596	Donald Trump	And you know what?
597	Donald Trump	I'll tell you.
598	Donald Trump	I came in, and I said that to a group of people that are professionals and have been working with the vets for a long time.
599	Donald Trump	They said, "Yeah, we know about that.
600	Donald Trump	We've been trying to get it for 30 years.
601	Donald Trump	We couldn't get it approved."
602	Donald Trump	So, I was so disappointed, because I thought it was my idea.
603	Donald Trump	But I'll tell you what I was good at.
604	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
605	Donald Trump	I was good at getting it done.
606	Donald Trump	We got it done.
607	Donald Trump	I signed it.
608	Donald Trump	That's what I was good at.
609	Donald Trump	I got it done.
610	Donald Trump	We got it done.
611	Donald Trump	They'd been trying to get it done for 40 years.
612	Donald Trump	I was so disappointed.
613	Donald Trump	I thought it was my idea.
614	Donald Trump	That's the only problem.
615	Donald Trump	I thought it was my idea.
616	Donald Trump	And, you know, we have another thing.
617	Donald Trump	Accountability with the vets.
618	Donald Trump	The V.A.
619	Donald Trump	-- there was no accountability.
620	Donald Trump	You'd have people that were protected, whether it was civil service unions, who cares.
621	Donald Trump	They were protected.
622	Donald Trump	You couldn't fire them.
623	Donald Trump	They could be sadists, and we had sadists.
624	Donald Trump	Sick people.
625	Donald Trump	We had people that would steal and rob.
626	Donald Trump	We had a lot of bad people.
627	Donald Trump	We had people that didn't work hard.
628	Donald Trump	And there was no accountability.
629	Donald Trump	For 40 years they tried to get the V.A.
630	Donald Trump	Accountability Act passed.
631	Donald Trump	I got it passed.
632	Donald Trump	And now, you look at the guy that did it, and you say, "Jim Smith, you've done a hell of a lousy job.
633	Donald Trump	You're late, and you don't treat our vets right.
634	Donald Trump	Jim, I'm sorry, you're fired.
635	Donald Trump	Get out of here."
636	Donald Trump	Right?
637	Donald Trump	Right?
638	Donald Trump	Jim, you're fired.
639	Audience	USA!
640	Audience	USA!
641	Audience	USA!
642	Donald Trump	So, those two things for the -- I just approved them.
643	Donald Trump	The accountability was a couple of months ago.
644	Donald Trump	And John helped so much.
645	Donald Trump	I'll tell you.
646	Donald Trump	John helped so much.
647	Donald Trump	He was a leader.
648	Donald Trump	Thank you.
649	Donald Trump	He was a leader on both.
650	Donald Trump	And everybody said you couldn't get accountability done.
651	Donald Trump	I said, "Why?"
652	Donald Trump	Too much power, too many unions, too many people that just don't want it done.
653	Donald Trump	You had people in Arizona that robbed $300,000 and they could -- they agreed.
654	Donald Trump	Everybody agreed.
655	Donald Trump	They robbed the money.
656	Donald Trump	They couldn't fire the people.
657	Donald Trump	So now you have -- accountability is done.
658	Donald Trump	And I think even more important -- I'm not sure.
659	Donald Trump	But even more important, V.A.
660	Donald Trump	choice.
661	Donald Trump	So now you go see a doctor when you have to wait on line.
662	Donald Trump	OK?
663	Donald Trump	Optimism among America's great manufacturers has hit 95 percent, the highest number by far in the history of the survey, which is a very old survey.
664	Donald Trump	We have eliminated record numbers of job-killing regulations.
665	Donald Trump	I think maybe as important as the tax cuts are the regulations.
666	Donald Trump	Our country was choking.
667	Donald Trump	And let me tell you, if our opponent, our wonderful opponent...
668	Audience	Lock her up!
669	Donald Trump	... when is she going to get over it?
670	Donald Trump	When does she get over it?
671	Audience	Lock her up!
672	Audience	Lock her up!
673	Audience	Lock her up!
674	Donald Trump	Oy, when do they get over it?
675	Donald Trump	But, you know, it is pretty amazing.
676	Donald Trump	Point after point, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty.
677	Donald Trump	Oh, she's OK.
678	Donald Trump	And then they go after us for a Russian hoax.
679	Donald Trump	It's a witch hunt hoax.
680	Donald Trump	It's -- isn't it incredible, when you talk about a double standard?
681	Donald Trump	When you talk about a double standard.
682	Donald Trump	And nobody even looks at her.
683	Donald Trump	Nobody even looks, I don't think, unless we're going to be surprised some day.
684	Donald Trump	Well, we'll see how that works out.
685	Donald Trump	But I'll tell you what.
686	Donald Trump	What's happened is somewhat of a miracle because we weren't expected to win.
687	Donald Trump	But every time I'd go out, we'd have crowds like this.
688	Donald Trump	We went to Michigan.
689	Donald Trump	We went to Wisconsin.
690	Donald Trump	We went to places that haven't been done.
691	Donald Trump	I think Wisconsin was 1952.
692	Donald Trump	Dwight Eisenhower.
693	Donald Trump	And we won Wisconsin.
694	Donald Trump	And Wisconsin, I went there, and I said, "I think we're going to win this state."
695	Donald Trump	And people said to me, "Oh, sir.
696	Donald Trump	It won't happen."
697	Donald Trump	I said, "Why?
698	Donald Trump	Look at the crowds we're getting.
699	Donald Trump	Look at the people.
700	Donald Trump	Look at the signs outside of the house.
701	Donald Trump	Look at the signs."
702	Donald Trump	I heard, and maybe it's not so, that Bill Clinton, President Bill Clinton, went back, and he went through Michigan.
703	Donald Trump	And he said, "You'd better get some people out to Michigan, because there's a Trump-Pence sign on every house.
704	Donald Trump	You'd better get people out."
705	Donald Trump	And they said, "Oh, no.
706	Donald Trump	Our statistics show that Michigan cannot be won by the Republicans."
707	Donald Trump	Well, let me tell you what's happened.
708	Donald Trump	Car plants are moving into Michigan.
709	Donald Trump	Jobs are moving into Michigan.
710	Donald Trump	Michigan's very happy with your president.
711	Donald Trump	They should have listened to Bill Clinton.
712	Donald Trump	They should have listened.
713	Donald Trump	And we just had our highest poll numbers.
714	Donald Trump	And I watch these fakers back there, and they'll be talking.
715	SYSTEM	[Booing]
716	Donald Trump	Well, you saw the polls that come out -- I don't know if this is true.
717	Donald Trump	You know, a year and a half ago, they said I was an interloper.
718	Donald Trump	How bad is that?
719	Donald Trump	An interloper.
720	Donald Trump	And now they say, and you will admit, a thing comes out, a big poll, and a couple of polls.
721	Donald Trump	A number of polls that, "He's the most powerful, most popular, Republican in the history of the party."
722	Donald Trump	And a little while ago I was an interloper.
723	Donald Trump	They came out "more popular than" a man I like, Ronald Reagan.
724	Donald Trump	Well -- but think of it.
725	Donald Trump	You go from interloper -- that's a horrible term, right?
726	Donald Trump	I was just doing my thing.
727	Donald Trump	I'm not an interloper.
728	Donald Trump	But we have tremendous -- look at the people.
729	Donald Trump	We endorsed Dan Donovan.
730	Donald Trump	He was behind.
731	Donald Trump	We endorsed him.
732	Donald Trump	He won by, like, 24 points or something last night, in Staten Island, New York, and New York generally.
733	Donald Trump	Dan Donovan, Congressman.
734	Donald Trump	Last night we had a great evening because we watched that television and we were winning left and right.
735	Donald Trump	They didn't know what the hell happened. And one of my biggest critics, a slovenly man named Joe Crowley, got his ass kicked...
736	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
737	Donald Trump	... by a young woman who had a lot of energy.
738	Donald Trump	She had a lot of energy.
739	Donald Trump	I guess he didn't see it.
740	Donald Trump	They couldn't find him.
741	Donald Trump	He spent a lot of money.
742	Donald Trump	He actually had a lot of money left over.
743	Donald Trump	Everyone is pouring a fortune because they figure -- and he was going to take Nancy Pelosi's place.
744	Donald Trump	And I was so disappointed, because I want to keep Nancy Pelosi right where she is, with Maxine Waters.
745	Donald Trump	I want to keep Nancy Pelosi.
746	Donald Trump	Please, I want to make a plea to my Democrat friends.
747	Donald Trump	Please, please, please don't remove Nancy Pelosi.
748	Donald Trump	She should be where she is.
749	Donald Trump	And please keep Maxine Waters on the air, as your face and your mouthpiece for the Democrat Party.
750	Donald Trump	Please.
751	Donald Trump	Maxine and Nancy.
752	Donald Trump	So, I was disappointed in a way when he got beaten, because he was going to take her place, I think.
753	Donald Trump	Now, he's just looking at us and saying, "Darling, what happened?"
754	Donald Trump	Politics is a mean game, isn't it?
755	Donald Trump	It's a mean -- it's a fleeting game.
756	Donald Trump	Six months ago, Republicans passed the biggest tax cuts and reform in American history.
757	Audience	Thank you.
758	Donald Trump	Our plan doubled the child tax credit, thank you to Ivanka Trump.
759	Donald Trump	She wanted that so badly.
760	Donald Trump	She really got to be a pest.
761	Donald Trump	Dad, you've got to get child tax credit.
762	Donald Trump	I said, "Darling, nobody knows what it is."
763	Donald Trump	She said, "The women know, Dad.
764	Donald Trump	The women know."
765	Donald Trump	My daughter and my wife, Melania, they love -- they love the women.
766	Donald Trump	And the women love them.
767	Donald Trump	The women love them.
768	Donald Trump	And the men love them.
769	Donald Trump	Child tax credits.
770	Donald Trump	People don't talk about it that much.
771	Donald Trump	It's very substantial.
772	Donald Trump	And you know we got it for you.
773	Donald Trump	We slashed taxes for working families, most of them in half, and saved our family farms and our small businesses by eliminating the estate tax in almost all cases.
774	Donald Trump	It's known as the death tax.
775	Donald Trump	And now, when you leave your small business or your farm, you leave it to your children.
776	Donald Trump	Your children don't go -- have to back.
777	Donald Trump	They don't go to the bank, borrow money, and end up losing the farm or losing the business.
778	Donald Trump	Thank Kevin and John and the whole group, they helped us a lot.
779	Donald Trump	And guess what.
780	Donald Trump	Heidi voted against it.
781	Donald Trump	OK?
782	Donald Trump	She voted against it.
783	SYSTEM	[Booing]
784	Donald Trump	Heidi voted against it.
785	Donald Trump	And she's always going to vote against it.
786	Donald Trump	And by the way, she may give us a couple of quickie votes, you know, before the election.
787	Donald Trump	She might, because she has no choice.
788	Donald Trump	But the day after that election, she's voting party line, 100 percent.
789	Donald Trump	More than 100 utility companies nationwide have slashed prices for customers, saving them and this country much more than $3 billion, which goes and reduces your electric and utility bill.
790	Donald Trump	Heidi and every single Democrat voted against our tax cuts.
791	Donald Trump	We're also fixing the disastrous trade deals that have plundered our wealth, gutted our communities, undermined our great farmers, taken our jobs.
792	Donald Trump	We are going to make trade fair and reciprocal.
793	Donald Trump	Reciprocal.
794	Donald Trump	You know what that is.
795	Donald Trump	They do it to us.
796	Donald Trump	We do it to them.
797	Donald Trump	And we are placing very big tariffs on some of these countries, because they have tariffs on us.
798	Donald Trump	It's incredible.
799	Donald Trump	I wonder where these people come from.
800	Donald Trump	Even politicians.
801	Donald Trump	So, we'll have a country.
802	Donald Trump	It doesn't matter.
803	Donald Trump	I can almost name any of them.
804	Donald Trump	They have massive tariffs on our people, on our workers, on our farmers, on our country, on our companies.
805	Donald Trump	So, we say we're going to put tariffs on them.
806	Donald Trump	And I'll actually have politicians and other people come to me.
807	Donald Trump	Oh, please.
808	Donald Trump	We want free trade.
809	Donald Trump	How is it free trade?
810	Donald Trump	I'll give you an example.
811	Donald Trump	China.
812	Donald Trump	If we make a car and sell it into China, they charge us a 25 percent tax.
813	Donald Trump	That's what it is.
814	Donald Trump	Twenty-five percent.
815	Donald Trump	When they make a car and sell it into the United States, and there are a lot of them, we charge them the grand total of 2.5 percent, and they don't pay that.
816	SYSTEM	[Booing]
817	Donald Trump	And then when I want to raise the game and play the game of poker, a game that we can't lose, I'll get even politicians, mostly Democrats, but even a couple of Republicans.
818	Donald Trump	They'll say, "We want free trade."
819	Donald Trump	That's not free trade.
820	Donald Trump	That's not fair trade.
821	Donald Trump	It is so ridiculous.
822	Donald Trump	Just play the game for a little while.
823	Donald Trump	It's a game we can't lose.
824	Donald Trump	You know, I've said a couple of times, when we're $500 billion down, they say, "Trump is starting a trade war."
825	Donald Trump	I say no.
826	Donald Trump	The trade war ended a long time ago, and the United States lost because our leaders didn't take care of our people and our companies.
827	Donald Trump	So, we're not starting a trade war, but we'll finish it.
828	Donald Trump	And you know what?
829	Donald Trump	In the end, you know what's going to happen.
830	Donald Trump	And it's already happening.
831	Donald Trump	Already happening.
832	Donald Trump	They're going to come to us, and they're going to say, "Hey, let's work it out."
833	Donald Trump	And we're going to work it out.
834	Donald Trump	It's very simple.
835	Donald Trump	But remember -- it is.
836	Donald Trump	It's the art of the deal, but anybody can do the deal.
837	Donald Trump	There are a lot of people.
838	Donald Trump	This one doesn't get much simple.
839	Donald Trump	Remember, it's true.
840	Donald Trump	When you're $500 billion down, you can't lose.
841	Donald Trump	You already lost.
842	Donald Trump	But now we're going to start winning.
843	Donald Trump	Or at least we're going to make it fair.
844	Donald Trump	It doesn't even have to -- we've got to make it fair.
845	Donald Trump	And the fact that we've had presidents and we've had leaders that worked for those presidents, negotiators, trade reps, who were missing in action.
846	Donald Trump	They weren't doing their job.
847	Donald Trump	You know, I was dealt a lot of bad hands.
848	Donald Trump	I was given North Korea where, frankly, we were very close to going to war.
849	Donald Trump	You could have lost 30 million people, 50 million people.
850	Donald Trump	Seoul is 30 miles off the border.
851	Donald Trump	They have what they call cannons, like howitzers.
852	Donald Trump	They have cannons, thousands of them, pointed.
853	Donald Trump	I had the meeting.
854	Donald Trump	We had a great relationship.
855	Donald Trump	We had a great chemistry together.
856	Donald Trump	The fake news was so upset when I said we had a good relationship.
857	Donald Trump	We had a good chemistry.
858	Donald Trump	They said, "That's a horrible thing."
859	Donald Trump	No, no.
860	Donald Trump	It's a good thing.
861	Donald Trump	Getting along with countries, getting along with China, getting along with Russia, getting along with these countries is a good thing.
862	Donald Trump	It's not a bad thing.
863	Donald Trump	Not a bad thing.
864	Donald Trump	And so, we have things cooking now.
865	Donald Trump	You're going to be so happy.
866	Donald Trump	But when people rush it -- you know, it's like rushing the turkey out of the stove.
867	Donald Trump	It's not going to be as good.
868	Donald Trump	The women can tell me, and some of the men.
869	Donald Trump	See, today I have to be politically correct. See, in the old days...
870	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
871	Donald Trump	... in the old days I would have never -- I just would have said, "Oh, I don't want to.
872	Donald Trump	It's too hokey."
873	Donald Trump	But it's true.
874	Donald Trump	Some of the men can tell me, too.
875	Donald Trump	Right?
876	Donald Trump	Some of the men.
877	Donald Trump	But here's what we do.
878	Donald Trump	The more they rush, the worse it's going to be.
879	Donald Trump	The longer we take, the better.
880	Donald Trump	Your farmers, your people are going to be great.
881	Donald Trump	You know, John -- I'll tell you, John and Kevin gave me something.
882	Donald Trump	They just told me this.
883	Donald Trump	Canadian wheat markets consistently discriminate against the United States' wheat by grading it as feed.
884	Donald Trump	Do you know what that means?
885	Donald Trump	They know what it means.
886	Donald Trump	I don't know what the hell it means.
887	Donald Trump	I just know it's a bad deal.
888	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
889	Donald Trump	But it's true.
890	Donald Trump	Canada charges us on dairy products a tariff of 275 percent, for you farmers in here.
891	Donald Trump	Two hundred.
892	Donald Trump	That's like saying, "We don't want your dairy products."
893	Donald Trump	It's no good.
894	Donald Trump	That's like saying, "We don't want North Dakota, Wisconsin, New York State.
895	Donald Trump	We don't want you there."
896	Donald Trump	Two hundred and seventy-five percent.
897	Donald Trump	And I actually hear that's an old number.
898	Donald Trump	They raised it a number of months ago to 300 percent.
899	Donald Trump	How horrible is that?
900	Donald Trump	And then Justin gets up.
901	Donald Trump	He said, "We fought World War I, we fought World War II," all true, "together."
902	Donald Trump	All true.
903	Donald Trump	We love Canada.
904	Donald Trump	But they're taking advantage of us.
905	Donald Trump	We can't let that happen.
906	Donald Trump	We can't let it happen.
907	Donald Trump	The era of global freeloading and taking advantage of the United States is over.
908	Donald Trump	It's just over.
909	Donald Trump	We're also restoring American security by rebuilding our military.
910	Donald Trump	We've secured a historic $700 billion.
911	Donald Trump	Just got it approved.
912	Donald Trump	$700 billion.
913	Donald Trump	We're rebuilding our military.
914	Donald Trump	And next year, already approved, $716 billion.
915	Donald Trump	We're rebuilding our military.
916	Donald Trump	It will be bigger and stronger than ever before.
917	Donald Trump	And hopefully we will never have to use it, because when it's bigger and stronger, you tend not to have to use it, OK?
918	Donald Trump	And in addition to that, we got $6 billion for drugs and fighting opioid abuse.
919	Donald Trump	$6 billion.
920	Donald Trump	We believe in peace.
921	Donald Trump	But it's got to be peace through strength, not weakness.
922	Donald Trump	Peace through strength.
923	Donald Trump	And I've directed the Pentagon to begin the process of creating a sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces, called the Space Force.
924	Donald Trump	The Space Force.
925	Donald Trump	Space Force.
926	Donald Trump	Because space is the new frontier.
927	Donald Trump	And I'm not just talking about going to up to the moon and going to Mars.
928	Donald Trump	And I want the rich guys -- you know, we have rich guys.
929	Donald Trump	They love these rockets.
930	Donald Trump	I said, "Lease them the land.
931	Donald Trump	Charge them a lot.
932	Donald Trump	They'll..." -- they just want to send rockets.
933	Donald Trump	But I look at it, with Bezos, with Elon Musk, they all love rockets.
934	Donald Trump	I said, "That's OK. Let's do it."
935	Donald Trump	Let them send a rocket up to Mars.
936	Donald Trump	Let's be the first.
937	Donald Trump	I hope they go fast.
938	Donald Trump	Let's help them.
939	Donald Trump	Let's make it really good for them.
940	Donald Trump	And if they do it, we're going to claim it on behalf of the United States, OK?
941	Donald Trump	We'll give them no credit.
942	Donald Trump	Let them spend the money.
943	Donald Trump	I think it's great.
944	Donald Trump	But I have a lot of military guys.
945	Donald Trump	And space, from a military standpoint, is really the new frontier.
946	Donald Trump	So, we're going to have a Space Force.
947	Donald Trump	Every day we are keeping our promises.
948	Donald Trump	But to keep this momentum going, we need Kevin Cramer in the Senate.
949	Donald Trump	All of us tonight are united by the same tireless values.
950	Donald Trump	We have pride in our history, respect for our great, beautiful, wonderful American flag, right?
951	Donald Trump	We put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance.
952	Donald Trump	And we proudly stand for our national anthem.
953	Donald Trump	Right?
954	Donald Trump	Proudly stand.
955	Donald Trump	In everything we do, we are standing up for our citizens.
956	Donald Trump	We are standing up for America, and we are standing up for North Dakota.
957	Donald Trump	Thank you.
958	Donald Trump	The forgotten men and women of our country are forgotten no more.
959	Donald Trump	No more.
960	Donald Trump	They don't know where they all came from.
961	Donald Trump	And by the way, our people, they call it the base, they used to say it's 35.
962	Donald Trump	Then they said it's 40.
963	Donald Trump	Then they said it's 42.
964	Donald Trump	Then they have these polls go -- we're driving them crazy.
965	Donald Trump	Now they say it's over 50 percent And then they said -- some great people.
966	Donald Trump	They said, "Any time Trump gets a poll, add 12 to it."
967	Donald Trump	Really.
968	Donald Trump	And did you ever notice -- I hate it.
969	Donald Trump	I meet these people.
970	Donald Trump	They call them the elite.
971	Donald Trump	These people.
972	Donald Trump	I look at them.
973	Donald Trump	I say, "That's elite?"
974	Donald Trump	We got more money.
975	Donald Trump	We got more brains.
976	Donald Trump	We got better houses, apartments.
977	Donald Trump	We got nicer boats.
978	Donald Trump	We're smarter than they are.
979	Donald Trump	And they say, "The elite."
980	Donald Trump	We're the elite.
981	Donald Trump	You're the elite.
982	Donald Trump	We're the elite.
983	Donald Trump	So, I said the other day, "Let's keep calling these people."
984	Donald Trump	And look, let's face it.
985	Donald Trump	They've been stone cold losers, the elite.
986	Donald Trump	The elite.
987	Donald Trump	So, let's let them keep calling themselves the elite.
988	Donald Trump	But we're going to call ourselves -- and remember, you are indeed.
989	Donald Trump	You work harder, but you are indeed smarter than them.
990	Donald Trump	Let's call ourselves from now on the super-elite.
991	Donald Trump	We're the super-elite.
992	Donald Trump	We are the super-elite.
993	Donald Trump	You are the people who farm the prairies, tame the badlands, and squeeze oil out of rock.
994	Donald Trump	Ugh.
995	Donald Trump	You celebrate your heritage, and you live life proudly under the big beautiful skies.
996	Donald Trump	And you have the big beautiful skies out here.
997	Donald Trump	Loyal citizens like you helped rebuild this country and together we are taking back our country, returning power to the everyday, smart, brilliant, wonderful, hard-working American people.
998	Donald Trump	We are standing on the shoulders of the American patriots who settled the frontier, scaled the Rockies, and won the American west.
999	Donald Trump	These are great, incredible, strong tough, tough people.
1000	Donald Trump	This state was forged by pioneer men and women who braved the cold and tamed the wilderness to build a home on the plains and a life for their families.
1001	Donald Trump	And it's been an incredible life.
1002	Donald Trump	These North Dakota pioneers were tough as hell and they were strong and they were smart.
1003	Donald Trump	And they all had one thing in common.
1004	Donald Trump	They loved their families.
1005	Donald Trump	They loved their countries, and they loved their God.
1006	Donald Trump	They never gave up and they never, ever, gave in.
1007	Donald Trump	And neither will we.
1008	Donald Trump	We will never stop fighting for our country, our families, and we will never, ever, stop fighting for our freedom.
1009	Donald Trump	As long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, we will never ever fail.
1010	Donald Trump	With your help, with your voice, with your vote, we will win, win, win.
1011	Donald Trump	Like we're doing.
1012	Donald Trump	Remember how I started.
1013	Donald Trump	This country, our country, our flag, we are respected again.
1014	Donald Trump	All over the world they're talking about us.
1015	Donald Trump	Leaders from all over the world, they call me, or they come to the Oval Office, and they say, "Congratulations, Mr. President, on the incredible job with the economy, the incredible job you're doing with your country.
1016	Donald Trump	The fact that your country is respected again, congratulations, Mr.
1017	Donald Trump	President."
1018	Donald Trump	Because we are Americans, and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue.
1019	Donald Trump	We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.
1020	Donald Trump	And together, we will make America wealthy again.
1021	Donald Trump	We will, and are, making America strong again.
1022	Donald Trump	We will make America safe again.
1023	Donald Trump	Look at our military.
1024	Donald Trump	We will make our great, great America stronger and more powerful than ever before.
1025	Donald Trump	We will make America loving again.
1026	Donald Trump	Love it.
1027	Donald Trump	Love it.
1028	Donald Trump	We're going to come together.
1029	Donald Trump	And we will make America great again.
1030	Donald Trump	Thank you.
1031	Donald Trump	Thank you, North Dakota.
1032	Donald Trump	Go out and get Kevin Cramer in the -- thank you, Kevin.
1033	Donald Trump	Thank you, everybody.
1034	Donald Trump	Thank you, North Dakota.
1035	Donald Trump	It's a great honor.
1036	Donald Trump	Thank you.
