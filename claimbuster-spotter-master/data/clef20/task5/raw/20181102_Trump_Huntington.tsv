1	Donald Trump	Wow, thank you so much.
2	Donald Trump	Hello, West Virginia.
3	Donald Trump	What a place.
4	Donald Trump	You know, we only won West Virginia by 42 points last time.
5	Donald Trump	42 points.
6	Donald Trump	You know what that is?
7	Donald Trump	That's like -- did anyone ever hear of 42 points -- and we're going to better this time, OK?
8	Donald Trump	But I'm thrilled to be back in this great state.
9	Donald Trump	I love this state with thousands of hard working American patriots.
10	Donald Trump	And what job numbers we had today.
11	Donald Trump	Did you hear?
12	Donald Trump	Did you hear?
13	Donald Trump	We're going to that.
14	Donald Trump	They all say speak about the economy.
15	Donald Trump	Speak about the economy.
16	Donald Trump	Well, we have the greatest economy in the history of our country... but sometimes it's not as exciting to talk about the economy, right?
17	Donald Trump	Because we have a lot of other things to talk about.
18	Donald Trump	Also, very important, the economy I unbelievable.
19	Donald Trump	You know it better than anybody because your state under our great Governor Big Jim Justice wherever he may be.
20	Donald Trump	Where is he?
21	Donald Trump	Where's big Jim?
22	Donald Trump	He's around here someplace.
23	Donald Trump	One thing you can't miss him.
24	Donald Trump	There he is.
25	Donald Trump	You can't miss him.
26	Donald Trump	He's got to be 6'11 and he's up there in the weight, but I won't get into it.
27	Donald Trump	He's the greatest.
28	Donald Trump	But I'm going to introduce him in a second.
29	Donald Trump	But we're here to celebrate our amazing achievements together, to make America's incredible comeback continuing and we will.
30	Donald Trump	Right now we're moving full speed ahead like nobody thought was possible.
31	Donald Trump	They did not think it was possible.
32	Donald Trump	They did not think it.
33	Donald Trump	In just four days -- so important.
34	Donald Trump	Because you have a great candidate.
35	Donald Trump	You have a couple of great candidates.
36	Donald Trump	Carol is a great candidate also.
37	Donald Trump	You know that.
38	Donald Trump	Carol Miller.
39	Donald Trump	In just four days the people of West Virginia are going to send Carol Miller to the House and Patrick Morrisey to the Senate so we making America great again.
40	Donald Trump	This election will decide whether we build on the extraordinary prosperity that we've unleashed.
41	Donald Trump	Nobody can believe what's happened.
42	Donald Trump	Or whether we let the radical Democrats take control of Congress and take a giant wrecking ball to our economy and to our future.
43	Donald Trump	America now has the best economy in the history of our country, and we want to keep it that way.
44	Donald Trump	In last month alone we added -- this just came out a few hours ago -- 250,000 jobs.
45	Donald Trump	That's in the month of October, by the way.
46	Donald Trump	That's for one month.
47	Donald Trump	And nearly half a million Americans returned to the workforce.
48	Donald Trump	We've created 4.5 million new jobs since the election, a number that was unthinkable.
49	Donald Trump	If I would have said that during the campaign, oh they would have given me a hard time.
50	Donald Trump	They would have said Pinocchio, you know, they do the whole thing.
51	Donald Trump	Oh boy.
52	Donald Trump	And we've lifted 4.3 million Americans off of food stamps.
53	Donald Trump	The unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in over 50 years.
54	Donald Trump	More Americans are working today -- think of this -- than ever before.
55	Donald Trump	More American today, right now, this hour, are working than ever before in the history of our country.
56	Donald Trump	How good is that?
57	Donald Trump	How do you lose that debate?
58	Donald Trump	When we're debating a lefty, how do you lose the debate when they're looking at you and say well, we're going to look at jobs.
59	Donald Trump	But more Americans in the history of our country.
60	Donald Trump	I mean that to me is -- here's another one.
61	Donald Trump	African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans unemployment have all reached the lowest levels in the history of our country.
62	Donald Trump	How do you lose that in a debate?
63	Donald Trump	How do you lose that in a debate?
64	Donald Trump	It's always nice.
65	Donald Trump	You know, when you go into a debate it is nice to have the facts on your side.
66	Donald Trump	It's going to be very tough to beat.
67	Donald Trump	Wages are rising and you know it's -- it's been incredible.
68	Donald Trump	And it just got announced they're going at the fastest pace in much more than a decade and wages went up.
69	Donald Trump	First time in a long time.
70	Donald Trump	They haven't gone up.
71	Donald Trump	People were making more money 19 years ago.
72	Donald Trump	I used to talk about it during the campaign.
73	Donald Trump	Where people had single jobs and they were making more money than they had with two and three jobs today.
74	Donald Trump	And now for the first time wages are going up, and they're going up nicely, and people have a choice of lots of different jobs.
75	Donald Trump	And right here in West Virginia jobless claims reached the lowest level in the history of your state.
76	Donald Trump	Is that good?
77	Donald Trump	No wonder I won by 42 points.
78	Donald Trump	No wonder.
79	Donald Trump	But then it was just talk.
80	Donald Trump	Remember?
81	Donald Trump	When I came, I was campaigning.
82	Donald Trump	What did you know?
83	Donald Trump	I mean, it was another, "Can you believe politicians?"
84	Donald Trump	I'm a politician.
85	Donald Trump	I guess.
86	Donald Trump	I have to say.
87	Donald Trump	Am I a politician?
88	Donald Trump	But I said things.
89	Donald Trump	And we overperformed, let's put it that way.
90	Donald Trump	We overperformed.
91	Donald Trump	And West Virginia's very happy, and that coal is coming back and our miners are working again, folks.
92	Donald Trump	They're working again.
93	Donald Trump	After years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country.
94	Donald Trump	And as you know very well, because you look at your wallet, Republicans passed a massive tax cut for working families, and we will soon follow it up with another 10 percent tax cut for the middle class.
95	Donald Trump	We've ended the war on beautiful, clean coal and we're putting our coal miners back to work.
96	Donald Trump	That you know better than anybody.
97	Donald Trump	Remember when my opponent in the last race went to another state about four weeks before she got to West Virginia?
98	Donald Trump	And she was bragging, how she was going to put the coal miners out of work?
99	Donald Trump	Remember that?
100	Donald Trump	Remember that?
101	Donald Trump	And I said, "You know?
102	Donald Trump	I don't think this is going to play well in four weeks."
103	Donald Trump	She was in a non-coal state, talking about how she was going to put the coal business out of business.
104	Donald Trump	That didn't work.
105	Donald Trump	It's doing great.
106	Donald Trump	And countries are buying our coal, and Asia now, you see what's happening?
107	Donald Trump	Asia's buying massive amounts.
108	Donald Trump	And you're back in business, folks.
109	Donald Trump	You're back in business.
110	Donald Trump	You wouldn't have been in business for another 12 months.
111	Donald Trump	You were going to be out of business in 12 months.
112	Donald Trump	You couldn't have -- you couldn't have sustained it.
113	Donald Trump	I'm telling you, the timing was perfect.
114	Donald Trump	Don't ever wait that long.
115	Donald Trump	You were ready.
116	Donald Trump	You were ready to go over the cliff.
117	Donald Trump	That wasn't good.
118	Donald Trump	But you're back in business.
119	Donald Trump	Your miners are back.
120	Donald Trump	And last year, our coal export skyrocketed by 65 percent.
121	Donald Trump	Pretty amazing.
122	Donald Trump	Under Republican leadership, America is booming.
123	Donald Trump	America is thriving.
124	Donald Trump	And America is winning.
125	Donald Trump	Winning like never before, because we are finally putting America first.
126	Donald Trump	It's been a long time.
127	Donald Trump	But if Chuck Schumer -- cryin' Chuck -- and Nancy Pelosi... and the legendary Maxine Waters... take power, they will try to erase our gains and eradicate our progress.
128	Donald Trump	That's what's going to happen.
129	Donald Trump	They're going to work hard, and we will be fighting.
130	Donald Trump	Oh, it will be -- it will be ridiculous, frankly.
131	Donald Trump	It'll be bad for our country.
132	Donald Trump	The Democrats -- and it could happen.
133	Donald Trump	Could happen.
134	Donald Trump	We're doing very well, and we're doing really well in the Senate.
135	Donald Trump	But it could happen.
136	Donald Trump	And you know what you do?
137	Donald Trump	My whole life.
138	Donald Trump	You know what I say?
139	Donald Trump	Don't worry about it, I'll just figure it out.
140	Donald Trump	Does that make sense?
141	Donald Trump	I'll just figure it out.
142	Donald Trump	The Democrats want to raise your taxes, restore job-killing regulations, shut down your coal mines -- and, by the way, they will shut down your coal mines.
143	Donald Trump	You know that.
144	Donald Trump	That's one thing I can guarantee.
145	Donald Trump	We can talk about taxes, and I'll be here, veto, veto, veto.
146	Donald Trump	But they ultimately want to raise your taxes very substantially.
147	Donald Trump	But I can tell you, they will shut down your coal mines.
148	Donald Trump	They want to take away your good health care, and essentially use socialism to turn America into Venezuela and Democrats want to totally open the borders.
149	Donald Trump	They have the caravans, let them in.
150	Donald Trump	Do you want to let them in?
151	Donald Trump	Does anybody want to let them in?
152	Donald Trump	I don't get it.
153	Donald Trump	Think of it -- you campaign on open borders and higher taxes.
154	Donald Trump	How the hell do you win that -- how do you win?
155	Donald Trump	You're right.
156	Donald Trump	Thank you, and we started the wall and built 1.6 billion and we have another 1.6 billion and then get another 1.6 billion.
157	Donald Trump	I want to build it all at one time, but wait till -- wait till you see -- go home and see tonight what our great military is doing on the border.
158	Donald Trump	Wait till you see.
159	Donald Trump	Go home and enjoy it.
160	Donald Trump	So the Democrats want to invite caravan after caravan and I don't know if you know -- you see the big caravan coming in?
161	Donald Trump	Three more are forming and you know what we give to these countries?
162	Donald Trump	Hundreds of millions of dollars to Honduras and to El Salvador, right?
163	Donald Trump	We have -- to others we give hundreds of millions of dollars.
164	Donald Trump	Do you know what they to give?
165	Donald Trump	Nothing -- nothing.
166	Donald Trump	They give us nothing.
167	Donald Trump	They give us nothing.
168	Donald Trump	That's going to be stopping, that's going to be stopping.
169	Donald Trump	But caravan after caravan is forming unvetted, illegal aliens trying to flood into our country on your dollar, over whelming your schools, depleting your resources, and endangering your community.
170	Donald Trump	Homeland Security has just confirmed that members of the lawless caravan, the one you've been watching, come from 20 different countries and influet among them criminals and gang members convicted of crimes ranging from armed robbery to sexual assault.
171	Donald Trump	And I don't know if you saw the one -- they interviewed him yesterday and he was asking for pardon.
172	Donald Trump	Didn't speak English and the nice young -- I guess reporter was saying oh, (inaudible) and what was it for?
173	Donald Trump	And essentially it was for murder who wants -- and he's in the caravan.
174	Donald Trump	This is what we have -- and you look -- you look at him, you look like nice, no, no murder, right?
175	Donald Trump	You saw that, good I hope you saw that.
176	Donald Trump	And then they gave me a hard time because I put it up on Twitter and they gave me a hard time.
177	Donald Trump	They said you shouldn't be doing that, that's not nice.
178	Donald Trump	And I say, all I'm doing is just telling the trust, what can I say.
179	Donald Trump	Republicans want strong borders, no drugs, no gangs, and no caravans.
180	Donald Trump	The choice in this election could not be more simple, a Republican Congress means more jobs and less crime.
181	Donald Trump	A Democrat Congress means more crime and less jobs.
182	Donald Trump	That's pretty good, that's nice and simple, doesn't get simpler than that.
183	Donald Trump	So this Tuesday you have to go out -- I know in West Virginia you tend to vote on Tuesday more so than I guess you could do the early thing, but everyone here likes to go out -- me too.
184	Donald Trump	There's something nice about its called Election Day.
185	Donald Trump	We're all old fashioned.
186	Donald Trump	That's why we get along.
187	Donald Trump	That's why we get along, but you have to go out on Tuesday and vote.
188	Donald Trump	And I'll tell you, Patrick's going to be fantastic.
189	Donald Trump	And you know what, he'll always vote for us.
190	Donald Trump	Not for me, for us.
191	Donald Trump	He'll always -- he's not going to be voting with Schumer or Pelosi and open borders and all the things that they want.
192	Donald Trump	And we're honored to be joined by a friend of mine who I just mentioned before because he is one great gentlemen.
193	Donald Trump	You know, he's a very, very successful man before he did this and he did it, and he made a mistake.
194	Donald Trump	He ran as a Democrat.
195	Donald Trump	And he didn't like it, and now he's a happy man and the Republican Party loves him.
196	Donald Trump	Big Jim Justice, your governor.
197	Donald Trump	Where is Jim?
198	Donald Trump	Thank you, Jim.
199	Donald Trump	Big Jim, you're doing a great job -- stay there, Jim.
200	Donald Trump	Just relax.
201	Donald Trump	Just relax.
202	Donald Trump	Just relax, but I'll tell you what, are you enjoying being governor, Jim?
203	Donald Trump	The people love you.
204	Donald Trump	65 percent up, coal exports, 65 and he works on it hard.
205	Donald Trump	Thank you, Jim for being here.
206	Donald Trump	Thanks for your support.
207	Donald Trump	We love -- we love our governor.
208	Donald Trump	Thank you, Jim.
209	Donald Trump	And another great friend of mine, somebody that has always been there, just always been there.
210	Donald Trump	And she is a fighter.
211	Donald Trump	She is very strong, tough but a great woman.
212	Donald Trump	He says Melania, that's true also.
213	Donald Trump	That's true, because surely I could say Melania too.
214	Donald Trump	Because she's been great.
215	Donald Trump	Great first lady, I will say that.
216	Donald Trump	And if you think it's easy being a first lady and married to me, it's not that easy.
217	Donald Trump	She's fantastic.
218	Donald Trump	But Senator Shelley Moore Capito, she was -- where is Shelley?
219	Donald Trump	Thanks, Shelley.
220	Donald Trump	Great job.
221	Donald Trump	Really a fantastic job, I appreciate it.
222	Donald Trump	Always there for us, always wanting to vote for West Virginia.
223	Donald Trump	Also joining us is Tim Armstead, who is running as you know for Supreme Court.
224	Donald Trump	A man who is highly respected and I just want to put a little word out, he's going for that extension.
225	Donald Trump	You know what an extension is, I guess you do a good job, you're supposed to be extended.
226	Donald Trump	And he has done so, Tim, wherever you may be -- where's Tim?
227	Donald Trump	Good luck, Tim.
228	Donald Trump	Good luck, Tim.
229	Donald Trump	Thank you.
230	Donald Trump	OK?
231	Donald Trump	And Jim specifically said you mind doing that, he's a good man, right?
232	Donald Trump	He is a good man.
233	Donald Trump	Thank you, good luck.
234	Donald Trump	Do you have any opposition -- any strong opposition?
235	Donald Trump	It's not strong, it's opposition but not strong.
236	Donald Trump	Nobody's going to beat you, Tim.
237	Donald Trump	Not after this anyway.
238	Donald Trump	Thank you, Tim.
239	Donald Trump	But I'm especially proud to introduce the next person who has really become (inaudible).
240	Donald Trump	And he's just -- he is a bundle of energy.
241	Donald Trump	He doesn't stop.
242	Donald Trump	You know, he's tied right now.
243	Donald Trump	They're tied in the polls, it's very close.
244	Donald Trump	It's very close.
245	Donald Trump	And I have to say, I like Joe.
246	Donald Trump	The problem is I'm just not going to get Joe's vote.
247	Donald Trump	I'm just not going to get it.
248	Donald Trump	I like him; he's a friend of mine.
249	Donald Trump	I'm just not going to get his vote.
250	Donald Trump	Even with Justice Kavanaugh, you know, I called Joe.
251	Donald Trump	I said, "Joe, do me a favor.
252	Donald Trump	I'd like you to vote."
253	Donald Trump	He said, "well, I may.
254	Donald Trump	I may."
255	Donald Trump	But no, but you got to vote before I win, not after we have the vote because it was a real question because nobody has ever been treated worse that Judge Brett Kavanaugh at the time now Justice Kavanaugh.
256	Donald Trump	Nobody, nobody.
257	Donald Trump	Get got blindsided like nobody ever got blindsided.
258	Donald Trump	What happened to him is disgraceful and what the Democrats did and the way they played that way a disgrace, right?
259	Donald Trump	A disgrace.
260	Donald Trump	And Joe said, "I'll think about it.
261	Donald Trump	I'll think about it."
262	Donald Trump	I said, "Joe, I don't want you to vote after we get the votes," because I didn't know we were going to have the votes without any Democrats.
263	Donald Trump	We didn't get one Democratic vote, so I said, "Joe, I need the vote like today."
264	Donald Trump	This was a few days before the vote.
265	Donald Trump	Well, let me think about it.
266	Donald Trump	Let me think about it.
267	Donald Trump	I want to wait to do it.
268	Donald Trump	OK, because there's nobody smoother than Joe, you understand.
269	Donald Trump	There's nobody smoother than Joe.
270	Donald Trump	And, no.
271	Donald Trump	He's much smoother than Schumer actually.
272	Donald Trump	Crying Chuck, right, right?
273	Donald Trump	When he wants something, he cries.
274	Donald Trump	But I've never seen him cry before, then he cried.
275	Donald Trump	But Joe said, "all right, let me think about it.
276	Donald Trump	Let me think about it."
277	Donald Trump	And then it came time to vote, and as you know we got the vote.
278	Donald Trump	And when that final vote was just coming out, Joe waited about one-tenth of one second.
279	Donald Trump	Now it means that Justice Kavanaugh was going to be Justice Kavanaugh, right?
280	Donald Trump	We had all the votes, so we didn't need Joe's vote.
281	Donald Trump	And he pressed that button.
282	Donald Trump	I think it was about one-eighth of one second after we had the final vote from Susan Collins, who did us a good job, good job.
283	Donald Trump	She did a good job.
284	Donald Trump	Really did.
285	Donald Trump	And it was really a tough period of time, but Joe -- I said, "Joe, that doesn't count."
286	Donald Trump	It doesn't count because if we would have needed the vote it was not going to happen.
287	Donald Trump	Does that make any sense?
288	Donald Trump	Do you guys understand that?
289	Donald Trump	I said, "Joe, do it before we have the vote.
290	Donald Trump	I think we've got the vote.
291	Donald Trump	Do it before we have the vote."
292	Donald Trump	And he said, "let me think.
293	Donald Trump	Let me think."
294	Donald Trump	And then when I spoke to him later he tried to say, "but I was watching for that one-eighth of a second.
295	Donald Trump	I was watching."
296	Donald Trump	But he didn't do it.
297	Donald Trump	He didn't do it.
298	Donald Trump	And I'll tell you what.
299	Donald Trump	Patrick Morrisey, I built up your coal business and it's going to get a lot better by the way.
300	Donald Trump	A lot.
301	Donald Trump	As much as you're doing and as good as you're doing, if you look at what's happening, if you look at other countries wanting our coal -- and I'll tell you, which buys a lot of coal from West Virginia.
302	Donald Trump	Do you know that?
303	Donald Trump	Vietnam -- I was with the Prime Minister and the president.
304	Donald Trump	You know, when you're with -- well, like when you're the President of the United States -I went to Vietnam, I went to various places in Asia -- but where you're the president here, you're not greeted by a president.
305	Donald Trump	You're greeted by a president and the Prime Minister.
306	Donald Trump	They have both.
307	Donald Trump	And they said they buy their coal now, because of me, from West Virginia.
308	Donald Trump	Well, that's good.
309	Donald Trump	But I -- something I didn't know -- I learned a lot since then.
310	Donald Trump	That was six months ago -- they said it is -- they've used coal for a long time.
311	Donald Trump	They said it's the finest coal in the world.
312	Donald Trump	It's the finest coal in the world.
313	Donald Trump	They have a lot of options, but they said it's the finest coal.
314	Donald Trump	I said, "good, if I'm never like around the people, which I expect to be a lot, I will explain that."
315	Donald Trump	But you -- do you understand?
316	Donald Trump	Do the miners know what I'm saying what I say that?
317	Donald Trump	The finest -- see, somebody like me coming from 5th Avenue.
318	Donald Trump	What the hell do I know about that?
319	Donald Trump	All I know is I want to put my miners back to work.
320	Donald Trump	And I know it works.
321	Donald Trump	And I know -- and I know for national security reasons -- another reason -- coal is something we have to have.
322	Donald Trump	We have to have.
323	Donald Trump	But they said it's the finest coal in the world.
324	Donald Trump	I thought that was great.
325	Donald Trump	Might as well tell you.
326	Donald Trump	Now I've told you and I don't feel guilty any longer.
327	Donald Trump	But I just want to introduce your next United States senator from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey.
328	Donald Trump	Patrick, come on up.
329	Patrick Morrisey	Wow.
330	Patrick Morrisey	Isn't this president making West Virginia great again?
331	Patrick Morrisey	Thank you, Mr. President, for coming back again.
332	Patrick Morrisey	I have to tell you, last night I had a debate with Senator Joe Manchin.
333	Patrick Morrisey	And you know what he said?
334	Patrick Morrisey	He attacked -- he attacked me for supporting President Trump.
335	Patrick Morrisey	Well I will never apologize for defending President Trump, nor will I kneel to alter of Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer or Nancy Pelosi.
336	Patrick Morrisey	I ask for your vote today.
337	Patrick Morrisey	President Trump needs a staunch ally in the U.S. Senate.
338	Patrick Morrisey	I will be that ally.
339	Patrick Morrisey	But I need your vote.
340	Patrick Morrisey	I need your help.
341	Patrick Morrisey	Go online.
342	Patrick Morrisey	patrickmorrisey.com, volunteer, donate, help me defeat the Manchin Schumer ATM machine.
343	Patrick Morrisey	Mr. President, thank you for everything you've done for West Virginia.
344	Patrick Morrisey	You've been huge in our state and I look forward to winning and working with this president.
345	Patrick Morrisey	Thank you and god bless.
346	Donald Trump	What a good job that was.
347	Donald Trump	So I said how's Patrick Morrisey doing to some of my friends, two people that live here, they -- I said how's he doing.
348	Donald Trump	They said he is the Energizer bunny.
349	Donald Trump	He is all over the state.
350	Donald Trump	You know, sometimes you'll ask that question about candidates -- I won't mention names -- and how're they doing -- oh, they're lazy, they're not working.
351	Donald Trump	They're not working.
352	Donald Trump	Well they couldn't say that about me in 2016 because (inaudible).
353	Donald Trump	Even these people say he's got a lot of energy.
354	Donald Trump	This man has a lot of energy.
355	Donald Trump	And just finally on Joe, I have to say that he was all for Hillary Clinton.
356	Donald Trump	He was for Hillary Clinton.
357	Donald Trump	She was against coal, she was against the miners, she got no support in this state, and yet Joe was totally in her camp. So that sort of -- that sort of tells you -- you know, Patrick -- as your attorney general, Patrick --
358	SYSTEM	[Audience chants Lock her up]
359	Donald Trump	That's up to Patrick and he won't do that.
360	Donald Trump	Because he's just focused on one thing, becoming your next United States senator.
361	Donald Trump	That's what he's doing.
362	Donald Trump	But Patrick's been tough on crime and a fierce defender of the rule of law.
363	Donald Trump	And as your senator, he'll always be the tireless champion for the great people of this great state.
364	Donald Trump	He loves this state.
365	Donald Trump	And your vote on election day -- thank you very much.
366	Donald Trump	He's not my type, but I like him anyway, folks.
367	Donald Trump	He's a rough looking guy.
368	Donald Trump	But you're going to decide.
369	Donald Trump	And -- and everybody's watching West Virginia.
370	Donald Trump	Because you know, this was a race -- when it started I won by a lot.
371	Donald Trump	And -- and a lot of people said that this was not one that was going to happen.
372	Donald Trump	This was a while ago, and then Patrick came along and did unbelievably in the primary.
373	Donald Trump	He has won statewide a number of times so he's been -- he's been through it but he's won statewide.
374	Donald Trump	He knows your state as well as anybody I guess and a lot of people said well, I don't know.
375	Donald Trump	It's almost -- lets sort of focus on other states, which were also doing very well I have to say.
376	Donald Trump	And then all the sudden we see polls and it's tied -- it's in one case he's up a little bit, another case he's down a little bit but I mean its right there.
377	Donald Trump	Let's assume it's sided.
378	Donald Trump	It's going to be whoever gets the people going to the polls on Tuesday.
379	Donald Trump	The whole country is watching the great state of West Virginia.
380	Donald Trump	It's going to be a very exciting moment.
381	Donald Trump	They asked me -- the fake news media asks me recently, like a couple of days it will say, what race are you watching?
382	Donald Trump	Oh I'm watching Florida, I'm watching all of the red, but I said watch West Virginia.
383	Donald Trump	It's going to be very inter -- and they said what?
384	Donald Trump	I said watch West Virginia, the great place.
385	Donald Trump	So you're going to decide, maybe, which party controls the United States Senate.
386	Donald Trump	It's a very powerful love and a vote for Joe is a vote for Schumer.
387	Donald Trump	It's a vote for a majority leader who will be not good and we don't want to put anti coal -- these are anti coal people.
388	Donald Trump	We are -- they are anti coal people and they vote anti coal and frankly, that's what you're getting and if that's what you end up with it's your vote, not mine.
389	Donald Trump	Remember that, remember that.
390	Donald Trump	Joe will never be with us in terms of the vote, he'll be with us in a lot of ways.
391	Donald Trump	We'll go to dinner with him, we'll take him out, we like him but he's never going to vote for it so I just want you to remember that, ok?
392	Donald Trump	Ok, let's get on with it.
393	Donald Trump	Let's get on with it, let's get on with it.
394	Donald Trump	Patrick, I think if he ever voted against us I'll come back here, I'll say we're going to impeach him -- impeach, we will impeach Patrick.
395	Donald Trump	He'll never do it.
396	Donald Trump	He loves the people too much.
397	Donald Trump	He loves your industry too much.
398	Donald Trump	He understands the state too well.
399	Donald Trump	It's not going to happen.
400	Donald Trump	So if you don't want the Democrat mob like you saw in the Senate, vote for Patrick.
401	Donald Trump	Just vote for him.
402	Donald Trump	Finally, we're thrilled to be joined by the next member of Congress, a person who you really do like a lot I have to say, and she's doing well and I thought I'd just call her up for a second.
403	Donald Trump	Third district in West Virginia, Carol Miller, she's done a fantastic job, Carol.
404	Carol Miller	It is terrific to be up here sharing a stage with our great President.
405	Carol Miller	West Virginia loves President Trump.
406	Carol Miller	President Trump, thank you for all of the support you have given my campaign.
407	Carol Miller	I can't wait to be Congress to work with you.
408	Carol Miller	You can always count on me to put America first, fight for coal, grow our economy, protect Social Security and Medicare, embrace our veterans, and strengthen our borders.
409	Carol Miller	Mr. President, thank you so much for your commitment to West Virginia.
410	Carol Miller	God bless you and God bless our country.
411	Donald Trump	Thank you, Carol.
412	Donald Trump	Be careful.
413	SYSTEM	[Audience chats USA]
414	Donald Trump	So just to tell you that Carol is great on jobs, she loves our coal miners.
415	Donald Trump	You know that.
416	Donald Trump	She'll always support our vets.
417	Donald Trump	She's very strong on our vets.
418	Donald Trump	We love our vets.
419	Donald Trump	Our military and our law enforcement.
420	Donald Trump	And Carol's opponent is a radical left winger named Richard Ojeda.
421	Donald Trump	If you don't want to be saying the words Speaker Pelosi for the next two years, who will end your coal business, then you better vote for Carol Miller.
422	Donald Trump	Thank you, Carol.
423	Donald Trump	Thank you.
424	Donald Trump	Thank you, Carol.
425	Donald Trump	She's doing great.
426	Donald Trump	If Democrats gain power, they'll also be planning a takeover of American healthcare and that would be socialism, what they want to do.
427	Donald Trump	The Democrat plan would obliterate Medicare and eliminate Medicare Advantage for more than 121,000 West Virginia seniors who depend on it.
428	Donald Trump	Republicans will protect Medicare for our great seniors who earned it and by the way, who paid for it.
429	Donald Trump	Right?
430	Donald Trump	You paid for it.
431	Donald Trump	And Republicans will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.
432	Donald Trump	We're all doing that.
433	Donald Trump	I listened to President Obama speak today.
434	Donald Trump	He had a very small crowd.
435	Donald Trump	I have to be honest with you.
436	Donald Trump	They don't tell you that.
437	Donald Trump	You know?
438	Donald Trump	They don't tell you that.
439	Donald Trump	We had -- in Houston we had the biggest thing you've ever seen and they were saying Donald Trump spoke today in front of a few thousand people.
440	Donald Trump	Few thousand?
441	Donald Trump	We had over 100,000 people that wanted to come.
442	Donald Trump	We had 22,000 people in the arena.
443	Donald Trump	We had thousands and thousands of people outside of the arena.
444	Donald Trump	Donald Trump spoke today in front of a crowd of a few thousand people.
445	Donald Trump	Can you believe it?
446	Donald Trump	It's called the fake news, folks.
447	Donald Trump	But I head President Obama speak today.
448	Donald Trump	I had to listen -- I was in the plane; I had nothing else to do.
449	Donald Trump	I heard him talk about telling the truth.
450	Donald Trump	He was talking about you have to tell the truth.
451	Donald Trump	And yet 28 times he said you can keep your doctor if you like your doctor.
452	Donald Trump	You can keep your plan if you like your plan.
453	Donald Trump	They were all lies.
454	Donald Trump	Over and over again you heard that.
455	Donald Trump	Just used it to pass a terrible healthcare plan that we are decimating strike by strike.
456	Donald Trump	You saw what happened to the individual mandate, the most unpopular part.
457	Donald Trump	And we actually had Obamacare killed except for one Republican vote and any Democrat -- one Democrat and we would have had it obliterated and you would have had great healthcare.
458	Donald Trump	But we're doing a lot to make it a lot better until we do get rid of it.
459	Donald Trump	Then I heard him talk about the freedom of the press.
460	Donald Trump	We have to maintain the press.
461	Donald Trump	We have to love those people.
462	Donald Trump	Love.
463	Donald Trump	Except that nobody was worse to the President Obama.
464	Donald Trump	Nobody.
465	Donald Trump	In fact, he even used, as I remember, the Justice Department to go after reporters.
466	Donald Trump	Remember?
467	Donald Trump	Remember?
468	Donald Trump	When he's talking about how I should be nice to the fake news.
469	Donald Trump	No thank you.
470	Donald Trump	And let's not forget President Obama's false promises about our trade deals.
471	Donald Trump	Just one.
472	Donald Trump	His administration promised that with South Korea we would create in a trade deal 70,000 jobs.
473	Donald Trump	But instead of that, it killed over 100,000 jobs in our country.
474	Donald Trump	It was a horrible deal, which by the way, I have totally renegotiated and made it a good deal.
475	Donald Trump	Lie after lie, broken promise after broken promise, that's what he did.
476	Donald Trump	Unlike President Obama, we live by a different moto.
477	Donald Trump	It's called promises made, promises kept.
478	Donald Trump	And we've done more than we ever said we would.
479	Donald Trump	We said we were going to do things and we've done a lot more and they will be the first to tell you tell.
480	Donald Trump	Democrats' plan -- that's right, the magic wand, right?
481	Donald Trump	Remember, he said you need a magic wand to produce manufacturing jobs.
482	Donald Trump	Well, we just hit almost 600,000.
483	Donald Trump	Democrats' plan to destroy healthcare, also includes raiding Medicare to fund benefits for illegal immigrants.
484	Donald Trump	I'm sure you don't mind that.
485	Donald Trump	As we speak, Democrats are openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to violate our laws and to over run our borders.
486	Donald Trump	They want to sign illegal aliens up for free healthcare, free welfare, free education and the right to vote.
487	Donald Trump	Otherwise, they don't get much.
488	Donald Trump	Illegal immigration cost American tax payers more than $100 billion every single year, more than 20 times the entire state budget of the sate of West Virginia.
489	Donald Trump	We need to use our precious resources to help low income Americans who respect our laws, not caravans who break in to our country and break our laws.
490	Donald Trump	We don't want that.
491	Donald Trump	We don't want that, I'm sorry.
492	Donald Trump	Now, we don't mind if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
493	Donald Trump	Democrat immigration policies not only drain our treasury, but they threaten our communities.
494	Donald Trump	Nearly 100 percent of heroin in the United States enters though the southern border, along with roughly 90 percent of cocaine, the majority of meth and a substantial portion of the ultra lethal fentanyl killing a youth drug, fentanyl -- the worst.
495	Donald Trump	These drugs kill more than 70,000 Americans every single year.
496	Donald Trump	Last year alone, our brave ICE officers who they want to get rid of by the way, these are tough, great, strong patriots.
497	Donald Trump	We need strength, arrested more than 127,000.
498	Donald Trump	Think of that, 127,000-- Aliens- With criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 48,000 assaults, 12,000 sex crimes and 1,800 homicides.
499	Donald Trump	They want to get rid of them, let's get rid of ICE.
500	Donald Trump	What are these people thinking?
501	Donald Trump	That's why you have to have Patrick Morrisey and Carol.
502	Donald Trump	You have to vote them in on Tuesday.
503	Donald Trump	You have to do it.
504	Donald Trump	Yet Democrats want to abolish ICE, they want to turn America in to a giant sanctuary for criminal aliens, drug dealers and MS-13 killers.
505	Donald Trump	And by the way, we remove thousands over the last little bit less than two years that I've been here.
506	Donald Trump	Thousands and thousands of MS-13 gang members have been thrown the hell out of the country.
507	Donald Trump	A blue wave equals a crime wave -- you don't hear too much about the blue wave anymore though, do you?
508	Donald Trump	Remember a couple of months -- oh, the blue wave, oh the blue wave.
509	Donald Trump	Now they don't talk -- you know, I'm not saying they don't squeak it by, maybe because they got of races and I can't go everywhere.
510	Donald Trump	Can't go everywhere.
511	Donald Trump	But now they're talking about (inaudible).
512	Donald Trump	I mean, you know let's see what happens.
513	Donald Trump	Going t be an interesting day at the office.
514	Donald Trump	You remember that election two years ago?
515	Donald Trump	There were a lot of really happy people that night, but there were some that were slightly -- not too happy.
516	Donald Trump	Cry, baby, cry.
517	Donald Trump	A red wave equals jobs and safety.
518	Donald Trump	Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens.
519	Donald Trump	And Republicans will always stand with the heroes of ICE, border patrol and our great law enforcement.
520	Donald Trump	You have great law enforcement right here... in West Virginia.
521	Donald Trump	I look at those people -- I'm looking at your law enforcement right there.
522	Donald Trump	I feel very safe.
523	Donald Trump	Thank you, fellas.
524	Donald Trump	Thank you.
525	Donald Trump	Thank you.
526	Donald Trump	Thank you, fellas.
527	Donald Trump	And, yes, the wall is happening.
528	Donald Trump	It should happen immediately.
529	Donald Trump	It's moving beautifully.
530	Donald Trump	The design is beautiful, and it's happening.
531	Donald Trump	And some communities in California, of all places, down to miss San Diego, we're just about finishing it up.
532	Donald Trump	But they're demanding the wall.
533	Donald Trump	They want the wall.
534	Donald Trump	I said, "Let's not give it to them because then they'll put pressure on their government to build it," right?
535	Donald Trump	Now once we build it for them, they'll say, "We shouldn't have a wall."
536	Donald Trump	But they already have their wall.
537	Donald Trump	That's the way it works, folks.
538	Donald Trump	Border security is also a woman's issue.
539	Donald Trump	You know, they keep talking about women.
540	Donald Trump	Trump with women.
541	Donald Trump	Remember the last election?
542	Donald Trump	Well, Donald Trump won't do very well with women.
543	Donald Trump	I did great with women.
544	Donald Trump	Look at the (inaudible).
545	Donald Trump	I did great.
546	Donald Trump	Right?
547	Donald Trump	I did great with women.
548	Donald Trump	In fact, at the end, when I won, they -- they said, "You know, a statistic we got wrong, women really came out for Trump."
549	Donald Trump	I said, "Thank you.
550	Donald Trump	Thank you."
551	Donald Trump	Same thing now.
552	Donald Trump	Because women want safe neighborhoods for their families, right?
553	Donald Trump	They want great schools, health care for their children.
554	Donald Trump	They want to keep drug dealers and predators and traffickers -- how about the traffickers?
555	Donald Trump	These are human traffickers.
556	Donald Trump	These are the worst scum in the world.
557	Donald Trump	They want them out of our country.
558	Donald Trump	And we do that.
559	Donald Trump	The Democrats don't do that.
560	Donald Trump	They want the open borders.
561	Donald Trump	Fly right in, folks.
562	Donald Trump	Come on in.
563	Donald Trump	We don't care who the hell you are, come on in.
564	Donald Trump	Think of it, 300 people.
565	Donald Trump	You know, we're getting a lot of heat because, I was saying, there were some bad people in that caravan.
566	Donald Trump	Right?
567	Donald Trump	So we checked, 300 people.
568	Donald Trump	I read them out to you.
569	Donald Trump	That is one more reason why women all across the nation are going to show up and vote Republican on Tuesday.
570	Donald Trump	They want security.
571	Donald Trump	They want safety.
572	Donald Trump	They don't want to have these people coming in.
573	Donald Trump	They don't want to have -- some of these people are just horrible people.
574	Donald Trump	You have to see the crimes they've committed.
575	Donald Trump	This election is about security, and it's about prosperity.
576	Donald Trump	For years, you watched as we let foreign countries plunder our wealth and shutter our factories and steal our jobs.
577	Donald Trump	And you watched helplessly.
578	Donald Trump	We don't watch helplessly any more.
579	Donald Trump	Those days are over.
580	Donald Trump	We've added half a million manufacturing jobs -- soon to be 600,000 -- since the election, including 32,000 in just the last month.
581	Donald Trump	These were jobs that the previous administration said would never happen.
582	Donald Trump	And these are great jobs.
583	Donald Trump	These are among our greatest jobs.
584	Donald Trump	Manufacturing jobs.
585	Donald Trump	And thanks to our tariffs that we put on steel that was coming in, and they were dumping it all over the place and destroying our steel companies and our aluminum industry.
586	Donald Trump	Roaring back.
587	Donald Trump	Steel industry is roaring back.
588	Donald Trump	And for the miners, by the way, in Minnesota and other places, we're grabbing that iron ore and they're making steel.
589	Donald Trump	And the hottest industry -- one of the hottest industries now, look at what's happened to steel.
590	Donald Trump	Steel, like coal, it was going off the cliff.
591	Donald Trump	You weren't going to have a steel industry in this country and we need it.
592	Donald Trump	Certain industries you need, you need steel.
593	Donald Trump	You don't have steel -- you need it for defense.
594	Donald Trump	What are we going to go incase we're -- hopefully we'll never have a problem, ok.
595	Donald Trump	I made the military -- it'll be stronger than it ever was before ever and that's why you won't have a problem.
596	Donald Trump	You know, if you don't want to have a problem, make your military much stronger than anybody else ever thought possible, but we need steel.
597	Donald Trump	How about this?
598	Donald Trump	We don't have any -- so see our steel bills were finished.
599	Donald Trump	We were going down -- you guys understand that, but we were going down.
600	Donald Trump	Now it's so hot, but you need steel.
601	Donald Trump	There are certain industries you have to have -- you need defense.
602	Donald Trump	You don't have it -- you have purpose, what are we gonna do?
603	Donald Trump	We have a conflict and we call China?
604	Donald Trump	We need more steel.
605	Donald Trump	Please, please, could we have some more steel?
606	Donald Trump	It's ridiculous.
607	Donald Trump	Our steel industry is roaring back and we're putting billions of dollars in our treasury because we're charging 25 percent tax on those people that dump their steel.
608	Donald Trump	They dump is all over the place in order to destroy our steel industry and the miner are coming back, in this case, since the iron ore and it's coming out and it's gonna -- it's a beautiful thing to see.
609	Donald Trump	I mean we've rebuilt -- we really started that about eight months ago, really heavy started it.
610	Donald Trump	I wanted to get my feet a little bit wet as President, right.
611	Donald Trump	We started it about eight months ago.
612	Donald Trump	It's incredible.
613	Donald Trump	The head of U.S. Steel called up, he said I've never said anything like it -- what you've been able to do in such a short period of time.
614	Donald Trump	They're building seven new plants, they're expanding plants.
615	Donald Trump	Nucor -- Nucor, a big steel company is building brand new plants $750 million, $900 million brand new plants.
616	Donald Trump	It's incredible.
617	Donald Trump	They haven't been built in years.
618	Donald Trump	Last month, I announced that we're replacing the horrible NAFTA deal, one of the worst -- stupidest deals ever made with an incredible brand new U.S. Mexico Canada agreement.
619	Donald Trump	We've taken the toughest ever action to crack down on China's abusive trade practices and we're doing very nicely.
620	Donald Trump	We'll probably make a deal.
621	Donald Trump	They want to make a deal.
622	Donald Trump	America is being respected again.
623	Donald Trump	We're respected as a country again.
624	Donald Trump	We were not respected for a long time.
625	Donald Trump	We were laughed at just like these stupid immigration laws.
626	Donald Trump	The whole world looks at it, they laugh, they said what is this all about?
627	Donald Trump	A person comes into our country -- another country throws them out.
628	Donald Trump	Hey, get out.
629	Donald Trump	You're not supposed to be here, you have to go through a process.
630	Donald Trump	You know what we do?
631	Donald Trump	We take them -- we can't do anything -- we bring them through a court proceeding.
632	Donald Trump	We take a person who walks onto our property we have a big deal -- a court case.
633	Donald Trump	They have lawyers, we have lawyers and what happens is then they go away and is supposed to come back for the trial.
634	Donald Trump	Could be two years, three years later and they disappear into the country never to be seen again.
635	Donald Trump	There's no trial, very few people come back -- almost none.
636	Donald Trump	This is the procedure.
637	Donald Trump	This is the law.
638	Donald Trump	This is crazy.
639	Donald Trump	And the Democrats don't want to change it because they know its chaos and a disaster and they think that's good, but I think it's good for us because I think they overplayed their hand.
640	Donald Trump	And how these caravans were formed, you'll have to figure that out.
641	Donald Trump	But they overplayed their hand too, assuming they had something to do with it but it was very well organized, amazingly, in Honduras and the different places very well.
642	Donald Trump	And you know they came up and I'll tell you people are really energized.
643	Donald Trump	They're energized about that, they're energized about the way justice, as you know Kavanaugh.
644	Donald Trump	Just as Kavanaugh was treated, they're energized when they saw the way he was -- Brett Kavanaugh -- when they saw the way he was treated, they're energized about a lot of things.
645	Donald Trump	They want to see us be a great, respected country.
646	Donald Trump	And that's what's happening.
647	Donald Trump	We have taken bold action to reduce the price of prescription drugs to help critically ill patients get life saving treatments.
648	Donald Trump	We passed something that they've been trying to pass for many, many years.
649	Donald Trump	It's called right to try where you can try stuff.
650	Donald Trump	That isn't out yet, but it's looking promising.
651	Donald Trump	That's such an important thing.
652	Donald Trump	They've been trying to pass that for decades.
653	Donald Trump	I got it done.
654	Donald Trump	After years of surging premiums, the cost of healthcare is finally coming down.
655	Donald Trump	We're getting the cost of healthcare down.
656	Donald Trump	And last month, I proudly signed the largest bill to fight the opioid epidemic.
657	Donald Trump	It's the largest bill in American history.
658	Donald Trump	We passed Veterans Choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor.
659	Donald Trump	And the landmark VA accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreat our veterans will be held accountable.
660	Donald Trump	You are fired.
661	Donald Trump	Get out.
662	Donald Trump	We secured $700 billion and $716 billion to fully rebuild the United States military.
663	Donald Trump	And we gave our great warriors, I know you have some of them right here.
664	Donald Trump	And I know they don't care about this, they couldn't care less, they don't mind; maybe we'll take it back.
665	Donald Trump	We gave them the largest pay raise they've had in more than a decade.
666	Donald Trump	OK?
667	Donald Trump	Our military.
668	Donald Trump	They deserve it.
669	Donald Trump	And my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth ranch of the American armed forces, the Space force.
670	Donald Trump	I was (inaudible) the United States from the horrible one sided Iran nuclear deal.
671	Donald Trump	And just today, we riposted all sanctions that were lifted under that horrible deal.
672	Donald Trump	Just today.
673	Donald Trump	We now have in place the toughest ever sanctions on a corrupt regime in Iran.
674	Donald Trump	We've recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem.
675	Donald Trump	Many, many presidents said they were going to do that, they never got it done.
676	Donald Trump	I got it done.
677	Donald Trump	I even got it built.
678	Donald Trump	I already built the embassy.
679	Donald Trump	$1 billion under budget, right?
680	Donald Trump	One billion.
681	Donald Trump	One billion under budget.
682	Donald Trump	It was supposed to go as $1.1 billion, we go tit done for less than $500,000.
683	Donald Trump	That's not bad, that's -- it's a long story, I won't bother telling you this.
684	Donald Trump	But it's pretty amazing.
685	Donald Trump	And there are many things like that.
686	Donald Trump	Together, we have made extraordinary progress.
687	Donald Trump	And we're just getting started.
688	Donald Trump	But the democrats want to turn back the clock and put America in reverse and give power back to corrupt, selfish ruling class people.
689	Donald Trump	And they want to take the power back for themselves.
690	Donald Trump	But we are not going backwards, we're going forwards.
691	Donald Trump	I need your vote for a republican house.
692	Donald Trump	I need your vote for a republican senate.
693	Donald Trump	So we can continue this incredible movement, the greatest political movement in the history of our country.
694	Donald Trump	And I say it all the time.
695	Donald Trump	And they can challenge it.
696	Donald Trump	Greatest movement in the history of our country.
697	Donald Trump	You know, Bernie Sanders had a reasonably good movement.
698	Donald Trump	But Hilary clipped him.
