1	Donald Trump	Oh, we had such luck in Orlando, we love being in Orlando.
2	Donald Trump	Thank you.
3	Donald Trump	Thank you, Orlando.
4	Donald Trump	What a turnout!
5	Donald Trump	What a turnout!
6	Donald Trump	You know this is a very big arena for a Tuesday night.
7	Donald Trump	I said, you know, if we have about three or four empty seats, the fake news will say, Headlines: "He didn't fill up the arena", so I said, maybe we shouldn't take a chance.
8	Donald Trump	Maybe we shouldn't go to Orlando as you go someplace else, then I said, "No, I think, we'll go to Orlando."
9	Donald Trump	And -- and not only did we fill it up, but we had 120,000 requests.
10	Donald Trump	That means you folks have come out very, very good.
11	Donald Trump	Congratulations.
12	Donald Trump	I want to thank our great Vice President Mike Pence and his wonderful wife, Karen Pence, and our magnificent First Lady Melania, thank you.
13	Donald Trump	I am thrilled to be back in my second home.
14	Donald Trump	That's what it is.
15	Donald Trump	It's my second home.
16	Donald Trump	In many cases, I think I could say it's my first home, if you want to know the truth.
17	Donald Trump	It's the great state of Florida, very historic, because exactly four years ago this week, I announced my campaign for president of the United States and it turned out to be more than just a political campaign.
18	Donald Trump	It turned out to be a great political movement because of you.
19	Donald Trump	A great movement.
20	Donald Trump	A movement made up of hard working patriots who love their country, love their flag, love their children, and who believe that a nation must care for its own citizens first.
21	Donald Trump	Together, we stared down a corrupt and broken political establishment and we restored government of, by, and for the people.
22	Donald Trump	Our country is now thriving, prospering and booming.
23	Donald Trump	And frankly, it's soaring to incredible new heights.
24	Donald Trump	Our economy is the envy of the world, perhaps the greatest economy we've had in the history of our country.
25	Donald Trump	And as long as you keep this team in place, we have a tremendous way to go.
26	Donald Trump	Our future has never ever looked brighter or sharper.
27	Donald Trump	The fact is, the American Dream is back, it's bigger and better, and stronger than ever, before.
28	Donald Trump	2016 was not merely another four-year election.
29	Donald Trump	This was a defining moment in American history.
30	Donald Trump	Ask them right there.
31	Donald Trump	By the way, that is a lot of fake news back there, that's a lot.
32	Donald Trump	You know what I say, the amount of press we have tonight reminds me of the Academy Awards before it went political and their ratings went down the tubes.
33	Donald Trump	This was our chance to reclaim our government from a permanent political class that enriched itself at your expense.
34	Donald Trump	As I said, what a wonderful beautiful day at my inauguration, we did not merely transfer power from one party to another, but we transferred power back to you, the proud citizens of the United States of America.
35	Donald Trump	We stared down the unholy alliance of lobbyists and donors and special interests, who made a living, bleeding our country dry.
36	Donald Trump	That's what we've done.
37	Donald Trump	We broke down the doors of Washington backrooms, where deals were cut to close our companies, give away your jobs, shut down our factories, and surrender your sovereignty and your very way of life, and we've ended it.
38	Donald Trump	We took on a political machine that tried to take away your voice and your vote.
39	Donald Trump	They tried to take away your dignity and your destiny, but we will never let them do that, will we?
40	Donald Trump	Many times I said, "We would drain the swamp.",
41	Donald Trump	and that's exactly what we're doing right now, we're draining the swamp.
42	Donald Trump	And that's why the swamp is fighting back so viciously and violently.
43	Donald Trump	For the last two and a half years, we have been under siege, and with the Mueller report we won, and now they want a do over, they want a do over.
44	Donald Trump	Let's do it again, didn't work out too well, let's do it again.
45	Donald Trump	They want a do over.
46	Donald Trump	No president should ever have to go through this again.
47	Donald Trump	It is so bad for our great country.
48	Donald Trump	Our hopes, the great hopes.
49	Donald Trump	Our patriotic movement has been under assault from the very first day.
50	Donald Trump	We accomplish more than any other president has in the first two and a half years of a presidency and under circumstances that no president has had to deal with before, because we did in the middle of the great and illegal witch hunt, things that nobody have been able to accomplish, not even close.
51	Donald Trump	Nobody's done what we have done in two and a half years.
52	Donald Trump	We went through the greatest witch hunt in political history.
53	Donald Trump	The only collusion was committed by the Democrats, the fake news media and their operatives and the people who funded the phony dossier, crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC.
54	Donald Trump	It was all an illegal attempt to overturn the results of the election spy on our campaign, which is what they did and subvert our democracy.
55	Donald Trump	Remember, the insurance policy, just in case Hillary Clinton lost.
56	Donald Trump	Remember the insurance policy?
57	Donald Trump	They appointed 18 very angry Democrats to try to take down our incredible movement.
58	Donald Trump	After two years, 1.4 million pages of documents, 500 search warrants, 500 witnesses, 2,800 subpoenas, and 40 FBI agents working round the clock.
59	Donald Trump	What did they come up with?
60	Donald Trump	No collusion.
61	Donald Trump	And the facts that led our great attorney general to determine no obstruction.
62	Donald Trump	No collusion, no obstruction.
63	Donald Trump	And they spent $40 million on this witch hunt, $40 million.
64	Donald Trump	That's right, they spent $40 million, probably a hell of a lot more than that.
65	Donald Trump	And think about it, nobody's been tougher on Russia than Donald Trump.
66	Donald Trump	Nobody.
67	Donald Trump	We call it The Russian hoax.
68	Donald Trump	Remember, President Obama's famous line caught on the open mic, secretly telling the Russian president to quote, "Inform Vladimir that after my election I'll have more flexibility."
69	Donald Trump	Okay.
70	Donald Trump	Remember that?
71	Donald Trump	Remember that?
72	Donald Trump	Lot of people remember that, I remembered it.
73	Donald Trump	I saw it happen, I didn't like it.
74	Donald Trump	They don't bring it up.
75	Donald Trump	The fake news will never bring it up.
76	Donald Trump	And in September, just before the election, the FBI told President Obama about possible Russian interference and he did nothing because he thought that Hillary Clinton, Crooked Hillary was going to win, that's why he did nothing.
77	Donald Trump	He did nothing.
78	Donald Trump	I built up the military, imposed sanctions on Russia, and provided alternative energy sources for all over Europe that competed very, very strongly with Russia.
79	Donald Trump	We are, by the way, the No.1 producer of energy in the world because of what we've done right now, The Democrats don't care about Russia, they only care about their own political power.
80	Donald Trump	They went after my family, my business, my finances, my employees, almost everyone that I've ever known or worked with, but they are really going after you.
81	Donald Trump	That's what it's all about, not about us, it's about you.
82	Donald Trump	They tried to erase your vote, erase your legacy of the greatest campaign and the greatest election, probably in the history of our country, and they wanted to deny you the future that you demanded and the future that America deserves, and that now America is getting.
83	Donald Trump	Our Radical Democrat opponents are driven by hatred, prejudice, and rage.
84	Donald Trump	They want to destroy you and they want to destroy our country, as we know it.
85	Donald Trump	Not acceptable, it's not going to happen.
86	Donald Trump	It's not going to happen.
87	Donald Trump	To understand Democrats ruthless tactics, look no further than the United States Supreme Court and our court system nationwide.
88	Donald Trump	I will soon have appointed my 145th judge.
89	Donald Trump	President Obama was very nice to us.
90	Donald Trump	He didn't fill the positions.
91	Donald Trump	I get there the first day.
92	Donald Trump	How many judges do I have to appoint?,
93	Donald Trump	they said, "Sir, 139.",
94	Donald Trump	now it's 145 and we've just finished number 107, already approved sitting on the bench, how about that?
95	Donald Trump	And by the time we're finished with the rest, we will have a record percentages.
96	Donald Trump	Our percentage will be a record except for one person.
97	Donald Trump	One person has a higher percentage than your favorite President Donald Trump.
98	Donald Trump	You know who that president is?
99	Donald Trump	He's got a higher percentage than me and it's devastating.
100	Donald Trump	His name is George Washington.
101	Donald Trump	George is at 100% and there's no way I'm going to get there no matter what I tell you.
102	Donald Trump	Got 100%.
103	Donald Trump	Well, he was first, so he just appointed them all and that was it.
104	Donald Trump	That's going to be a hard record to beat.
105	Donald Trump	They want to take away your judges.
106	Donald Trump	They want to pack the court with far left ideologues and they want to radicalise our judiciary.
107	Donald Trump	You know that, we already have a lot of that.
108	Donald Trump	Look at what they did to a great gentleman, Justice Kavanagh, highly respected.
109	Donald Trump	They didn't just try to win.
110	Donald Trump	They tried to destroy him with false and malicious accusations.
111	Donald Trump	And thank you, Marco, and thank you Lindsey wherever you may be.
112	Donald Trump	Thank you, great job, thank you.
113	Donald Trump	Stand up.
114	Donald Trump	Yeah, Lindsey Graham was doing okay in South Carolina, aint that great?
115	Donald Trump	Now he's through the roof great.
116	Donald Trump	Thank you.
117	Donald Trump	Great job, thank you.
118	Donald Trump	Great people, great people, all of them.
119	Donald Trump	They tried to ruin the family of now, Justice Kavanagh.
120	Donald Trump	They tried to ruin his career, they tried to ruin his life.
121	Donald Trump	They even wanted to impeach him on fraudulent charges.
122	Donald Trump	Those charges were a fraud.
123	Donald Trump	He did nothing wrong.
124	Donald Trump	All in pursuit of political domination and control.
125	Donald Trump	Just imagine what this angry left-wing mob would do if they were in charge of this country.
126	Donald Trump	Imagine if we had a Democrat president and a Democrat congress in 2020.
127	Donald Trump	They would shut down your free speech, use the power of the law to punish their opponents, which they're trying to do now anyway, they'll always be trying to shield themselves.
128	Donald Trump	They would strip Americans of their constitutional rights while flooding the country with illegal immigrants in the hopes it will expand their political base, and they'll get votes someplace down the future.
129	Donald Trump	That's what it's about.
130	Donald Trump	And we are building the wall.
131	Donald Trump	We're going to have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year.
132	Donald Trump	It's moving rapidly, moving very rapidly.
133	Donald Trump	And you know we couldn't get the wall approved by the Democrats, even though they voted for it four years ago and six years ago and didn't get built, but they voted for it, all of a sudden, Trump is president, we don't want a wall.
134	Donald Trump	Can you imagine, can you imagine those caravans without having the barriers and walls that we've already put up and that are up.
135	Donald Trump	This country would be a mess like you wouldn't believe.
136	Donald Trump	So the wall is moving along, it's moving along rapidly.
137	Donald Trump	It's beautiful, I changed the design, it's stronger, bigger, better, and cheaper.
138	Donald Trump	Cheaper, a lot cheaper.
139	Donald Trump	You know sometimes when they don't give you the money, you have to make it cheaper, not going to happen, but it's going well.
140	Donald Trump	Instead of bringing us together as one America, Democrats want to splinter us into factions and tribes, they want us divided, not going to happen to the Republicans anymore, it's not going to happen.
141	Donald Trump	This election is not merely a verdict on the amazing progress we've made.
142	Donald Trump	It's a verdict on the un-American conduct of those who tried to undermine our great democracy, and undermine you.
143	Donald Trump	And by the way, on July 4th, in Washington, D.C., come on down, we're going have a big day.
144	Donald Trump	Bring your flags, bring those flags.
145	Donald Trump	Bring those American flags, July 4th, we're going to have hundreds of thousands of people, we're going to celebrate America.
146	Donald Trump	Sounds good, right?
147	Donald Trump	July 4th, celebrate America.
148	Donald Trump	This election is a verdict on whether we want to live in a country where the people who lose an election refuse to concede and spend the next two years trying to shred our Constitution and rip your country apart.
149	Donald Trump	You remember during one of the debates, when Crooked Hillary said, "If I win, are you going to support me?",
150	Donald Trump	but I must be honest, I didn't give her a great answer.
151	Donald Trump	That was a very -- I might have been my hardest question during the debates.
152	Donald Trump	Isn't it amazing that it worked the other way around, right?
153	Donald Trump	Is isn't it amazing?
154	Donald Trump	If you want to know how the system is rigged, just compare how they came after us for three years with everything they had, versus the free pass they gave to Hillary and her aides after they set up an illegal server, destroyed evidence deleted and acid washed 33,000 e-mails, exposed classified information, and turned the State Department into a pay-for-play cash machine.
155	Donald Trump	33,000 emails deleted, think of it.
156	Donald Trump	I keep mentioning, you know, there was a lot of corruption on the other side, but you know the simplest thing, they get a subpoena from the United States Congress and they decide that they're not going to give it so Lindsey Graham, they did delete and they acid wash, which is very expensive.
157	Donald Trump	Nobody does it, they acid wash those emails, never to be seen again, but we may find them somewhere deep in the State Department.
158	Donald Trump	But can you imagine, if I got a subpoena, think of this, If I got a subpoena for e-mails, if I deleted one e-mail, like a love note to Melania, it's the electric chair for Trump, 33,000 e-mails.
159	Donald Trump	But let's see what happens, we now have a great attorney general, let's see what happens.
160	Donald Trump	So if you either shut down this rigged system once and for all, then show up November 3rd, that's your day, big day, and vote, vote, vote, we're going to have a big, big day.
161	Donald Trump	Thank you.
162	Donald Trump	And remember the only thing these corrupt politicians will understand is an earthquake at the ballot box, that's what they will understand, and they're going to see it.
163	Donald Trump	We did it once and now we will do it again, and this time we're going to finish the job, and this time should be a lot easier because we have done so much with our military, with our vets, with the Second Amendment, with our regulations, with the biggest tax cut in history, with getting rid of so many different problems, so many different things, including, by the way, the individual mandate in Obamacare, one of the worst things anybody's ever had to live through.
164	Donald Trump	We got rid of the individual mandate.
165	Donald Trump	Right?
166	Donald Trump	How many people are happy?
167	Donald Trump	They no longer have to pay for the privilege of not paying for bad health insurance.
168	Donald Trump	How many people are happy?
169	Donald Trump	Bad health care.
170	Donald Trump	So every time you don't have to make out a check in order not to have health care.
171	Donald Trump	Think of that, think of that.
172	Donald Trump	This is the only country you pay for the very distinct privilege of not having to pay but you have to pay a lot.
173	Donald Trump	Now you don't have to pay anymore.
174	Donald Trump	You don't want it, you don't have to pay.
175	Donald Trump	The individual mandate, Mike.
176	Donald Trump	We got rid of it.
177	Donald Trump	That was a big deal.
178	Donald Trump	The people tried to stop our movement are the same Washington insiders, who spent their careers rigging the system, so your losses will be their gains, you know that.
179	Donald Trump	These are the same career politicians who presided over decades of flat wages, the loss of our manufacturing jobs.
180	Donald Trump	Sixty thousand, could you believe that?
181	Donald Trump	Sixty thousand, who would believe that number?
182	Donald Trump	And you know how I know it's true, because if it wasn't I've been using it a lot.
183	Donald Trump	The fake news would have headlines: Trump used a phony number., they'll have headline.
184	Donald Trump	It would be the biggest story: Trump used -- well, they never corrected it, so I assumed, fellas, 60,000 shuttered factories.
185	Donald Trump	We closed up 60,000 factories, it didn't seem right.
186	Donald Trump	It didn't seem like it would be possible.
187	Donald Trump	And avalanche of job killing regulations, a growing wealth gap and one ruinous trade deal after another.
188	Donald Trump	By the way, those trade deals are getting very good folks, you will see.
189	Donald Trump	We just completed the deal with South Korea.
190	Donald Trump	Great deal.
191	Donald Trump	We're working with Mexico and Canada.
192	Donald Trump	We have to get the Democrats to approve it.
193	Donald Trump	We wanted to be bipartisan.
194	Donald Trump	As you know, you may have read a couple of things about China.
195	Donald Trump	I spoke to President Xi.
196	Donald Trump	Terrific president, a great leader of China, spoke to him this morning at length and we'll see what happens, but we are going to have a good deal and a fair deal or we're not going to have a deal at all and that's okay too.
197	Donald Trump	Because we are taking in billions and billions of dollars into our treasury and companies are leaving China because they want to avoid paying these large tariffs.
198	Donald Trump	And by the way, when the fake news tells you that you are paying, in the case of China, they devalue their currency, that helps them.
199	Donald Trump	And you know what else they're doing?
200	Donald Trump	They're subsidizing those companies and you're not paying very much if you're paying anything at all, the case of China, and we are taking billions and billions of dollars in.
201	Donald Trump	And remember this, and you know it as well as I do, we have never taken in 10 cents from China, we would lose $500 billion a year with China.
202	Donald Trump	We rebuilt China.
203	Donald Trump	They've done a great job, but they took us for suckers, and that includes Obama and Biden.
204	Donald Trump	We took -- they took us for suckers.
205	Donald Trump	Five hundred billion, five hundred billion.
206	Donald Trump	Somebody said, "You mean five hundred million."
207	Donald Trump	That's a lot too, right?
208	Donald Trump	No, $500 billion, actually more than that, I don't want to be too specific 507.
209	Donald Trump	We're fighting against the same far left politicians that ravage our great cities and crush the dreams of African-American middle class, the same people who threw open our borders and allowed drugs, gangs, and illegal labor to devastate our poorest American communities, you know that.
210	Donald Trump	Our political opponents looked down with hatred on our values and with utter disdain for the people whose lives they want to run.
211	Donald Trump	That's the way they've been doing it and if you take a look at the African American community, how's -- how much progress has been made, the lowest unemployment numbers in the history of our country.
212	Donald Trump	They called you and us, do you remember this?
213	Donald Trump	They called us deplorables, that was a mistake.
214	Donald Trump	That was a big mistake.
215	Donald Trump	I'll never forget.
216	Donald Trump	I was making a speech after Hillary used the word deplorables, and I didn't think it was that bad, you know why?
217	Donald Trump	She used another word.
218	Donald Trump	You know what the other word was?
219	Donald Trump	She said, deplorables and irredeemables.
220	Donald Trump	I think that was worse, but it didn't get picked up.
221	Donald Trump	You never know what's going to get picked up.
222	Donald Trump	It didn't.
223	Donald Trump	I think irredeemables is worst than deplorables, but I'll never forget.
224	Donald Trump	I was making a speech the next day.
225	Donald Trump	We had a big crowd in a great, great state, and women, in particular, were wearing: We are deplorables, The deplorables love you.
226	Donald Trump	And there were hundreds and hundreds of people wearing: We are deplorables, and I said, "I think Hillary Clinton made a big mistake with that speech, and that is the problem with politics, one word and your career is ruined.
227	Donald Trump	You never know, you have to be very careful with the fakers back there.
228	Donald Trump	I have news for democrats who want to return us to the bitter failures and betrayals of the past.
229	Donald Trump	We are not going back we're going on to victory, going on to victory.
230	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
231	Donald Trump	take it away as fast as it came, and as Mike Pence said a little while ago, "That's why we want a little more time.
232	Donald Trump	It's going to be cemented, it's going to be cemented."
233	Donald Trump	You know we have a big decision to make.
234	Donald Trump	You know what I'm going to say, "We have to come up with a theme for the new campaign, right?
235	Donald Trump	Is it going to be Make America Great Again, which is probably and possibly the greatest theme in the history of politics, I think.
236	Donald Trump	Make America Great Again, MAGA country, right?
237	Donald Trump	MAGA, MAGA, MAGA, we're in MAGA country, that I can tell you.
238	Donald Trump	But you know today we had a massive day on the stock market.
239	Donald Trump	A lot of good things are happening, but we had a very big day and we're very close to, I think, are 68 record.
240	Donald Trump	You know we've hit all time records.
241	Donald Trump	This tremendous, I think it's actually more than that, but it's a lot.
242	Donald Trump	So now I say, we've made America great again, but how do you give up the No.
243	Donald Trump	1 call a theme, logo, statement in the history of politics for a new one, but you know there's a new one that really works and that's called Keep America Great, right?
244	Donald Trump	Keep America Great, right?
245	Donald Trump	Keep America Great.
246	Donald Trump	In other words make America Great Again, well, we've really done it.
247	Donald Trump	We've rebuilt our military, it's still in the process.
248	Donald Trump	We've taken care of our vets.
249	Donald Trump	We've cut the hell out of regulations.
250	Donald Trump	You know, have cut more regulations than any president in the history of our country, regardless of the length of their term.
251	Donald Trump	So now I say, we need-- we have a lot of brilliant talent campaign people, they cost a fortune and they never give me any ideas.
252	Donald Trump	I'm only kidding.
253	Donald Trump	So now, I'm saying, what do we use as our theme as our statement, so I'm going to ask you to vote on it.
254	Donald Trump	I'm going to go, Make America Great Again and Keep America Great.
255	Donald Trump	Let me just here by your cheers, what you like.
256	Donald Trump	So, in all fairness, Make America Great, the greatest of all time.
257	Donald Trump	I really believe that.
258	Donald Trump	The greatest of all time, how do you give up the greatest of all time with a new theme, because you know what's gonna happen?
259	Donald Trump	If I do it with a new theme, I give up the greatest of all time and if I lose, people are going to say what a mistake that was, but we're not going to lose so it's not going to matter.
260	Donald Trump	We're not going to lose, right?
261	Donald Trump	We're not going to lose.
262	Donald Trump	Are you ready?
263	Donald Trump	First, we do make America Great Again, then we do Keep America Great.
264	Donald Trump	Let me hear it.
265	Donald Trump	Ready?
266	Donald Trump	Make America Great Again.
267	Donald Trump	Not bad.
268	Donald Trump	I would have said that three years ago, wouldn't be a contest, right?
269	Donald Trump	You're ready?
270	Donald Trump	Keep America Great.
271	Donald Trump	Wow, I'm sorry MAGA country, but that wasn't too close.
272	Donald Trump	I thought you had it won, and then I heard this cheer.
273	Donald Trump	My eardrums will never be the same.
274	Donald Trump	Keep America Great.
275	Donald Trump	We're going to keep on fighting for every man and woman and child all across this land.
276	Donald Trump	With every ounce of heart and mind, and sweat and soul, we're going to keep making America great again, and then we will indeed Keep America Great.
277	Donald Trump	I will keep it so great.
278	Donald Trump	Better than ever before.
279	Donald Trump	We're going to keep it better than ever before.
280	Donald Trump	And that is why tonight, I stand before you to officially launch my campaign for a second term as president of the United States.
281	Donald Trump	Thank you.
282	Donald Trump	I can promise you that I will never ever let you down.
283	Donald Trump	I won't.
284	Donald Trump	And I am profoundly thankful to my family.
285	Donald Trump	I have a great family Melania, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, Barron, Lara, Jared, Robert, Maryanne, Elizabeth, and my late brother, Fred Jr., we're joined tonight by many great patriots who fight right by our side.
286	Donald Trump	Florida's terrific governor.
287	Donald Trump	Thank you, Ron.
288	Donald Trump	Our first lady, Casey DeSantis.
289	Donald Trump	What a job you are doing.
290	Donald Trump	Thank you.
291	Donald Trump	Thank you, Ron, Casey.
292	Donald Trump	Thank you.
293	Donald Trump	What a job.
294	Donald Trump	And again, your great lieutenant governor, who I hear is fantastic, right?
295	Donald Trump	Jeanette Núñez.
296	Donald Trump	Jeannette.
297	Donald Trump	Thank you, Jeanette.
298	Donald Trump	Beautiful job.
299	Donald Trump	Your Florida CFO, Jimmy Patronis.
300	Donald Trump	Some really brilliant, tough, wonderful friends who have helped me so much, Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Marco Rubio of Florida, and Rick Scott of Florida.
301	Donald Trump	These are great people, they're tough, they're smart, and they love our country.
302	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
303	Donald Trump	Rick, Marco, Lindsey, thank you.
304	Donald Trump	Members of Congress, warriors also.
305	Donald Trump	Boy, they're up there, you want them protecting you, I'll tell you.
306	Donald Trump	They don't stop.
307	Donald Trump	Matt Gaetz, Ted Yoho, and Michael Waltz.
308	Donald Trump	And also, all of our friends and our supporters, you've been incredible.
309	Donald Trump	This has been a tremendous night.
310	Donald Trump	You've really been incredible.
311	Donald Trump	Since the very first day I walked through the doors of the White House.
312	Donald Trump	I have never forgotten who sent me there, You did, you did, you did, you did, you did, you did, you all did.
313	Donald Trump	When I get behind my desk in the beautiful oval office, I think about only one thing: how the American people are going to win, win, win today.
314	Donald Trump	And I'm fighting for you, and I think you see that, not easy, but I love it and the reason I love it because there have been few presidents that have been able to do what we've been able to do for you, and it is a great great feeling, thank you.
315	Donald Trump	Thank you.
316	Donald Trump	I love it.
317	Donald Trump	Together, we're breaking the most sacred rule in Washington politics.
318	Donald Trump	We are keeping our promises to the American people, because my only special interest is you.
319	Donald Trump	I don't have a special interest, I don't care, I don't care.
320	Donald Trump	And by the way, by the way, a woman who has been so good, so talented, so wonderful and we're sort of going to be losing.
321	Donald Trump	I have a feeling she's going to be running for a certain gubernatorial position.
322	Donald Trump	Don't worry about it, Ron, it's not going to be his last.
323	Donald Trump	It won't be in Florida.
324	Donald Trump	I promise you, Casey.
325	Donald Trump	She'll be tough, right?
326	Donald Trump	But a woman who's, a special woman and right -- and her father, by the way, he's out there fighting for us all the time, Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
327	Sarah Huckabee Sanders	Thank you, Mr. President.
328	Sarah Huckabee Sanders	This has been truly the honor of a lifetime.
329	Sarah Huckabee Sanders	One of the most incredible experiences anybody could ever imagine and that's because I've had the chance to be on the front row of history and watch you drastically change our country for the better.
330	Sarah Huckabee Sanders	You've made America great, you're gonna continue to make America great.
331	Sarah Huckabee Sanders	I couldn't be prouder to be part of your team.
332	Sarah Huckabee Sanders	I'm gonna go spend a lot of time with my kids, but no one will be a stronger voice and a more fierce advocate for this president, because he's fighting for all of the people in this room and for all of the people that you represent all over the country and he's gonna have an incredible six more years to make our country as strong as it's ever been.
333	Sarah Huckabee Sanders	Thank you so much, Mr. President.
334	Donald Trump	We're going to miss her.
335	Donald Trump	We're going to miss her.
336	Donald Trump	Thank you, Sarah.
337	Donald Trump	Incredible, a warrior.
338	Donald Trump	Since the election, we have created six million new jobs.
339	Donald Trump	Nobody thought that would be possible.
340	Donald Trump	They said it wouldn't be possible.
341	Donald Trump	We have lifted more than six million Americans off of food stamps and we're getting off of welfare and back into the workforce and they're so happy.
342	Donald Trump	They are so happy.
343	Donald Trump	The unemployment rate is the lowest rate it's been in over 51 years, think of that.
344	Donald Trump	And as I said before about African-American, I now say also about Hispanic.-American and Asian-American unemployment have reached the lowest rates in the history of our country.
345	Donald Trump	Unemployment.
346	Donald Trump	And African-American poverty has also reached, by far, the lowest rate in history.
347	Donald Trump	These are incredible numbers.
348	Donald Trump	And today, right now, as we speak, almost 160 million people are working, that's more than ever before, it's the first time ever, the number of people is almost 160 million and we're going to be breaking that number soon.
349	Donald Trump	Women filled 60% of the new jobs created last year and women's unemployment is now the lowest it's been in 74 years.
350	Donald Trump	Wages are rising at the fastest rate in many decades, and really what's nice is they're rising the fastest for the lowest income Americans.
351	Donald Trump	Isn't that nice?
352	Donald Trump	Percentage wise, the Fed and our pledge to the American worker through Ivanka Trump, she has worked so hard, she's worked hard, has secured commitments to provide private-sector training opportunities to nearly 10 million Americans.
353	Donald Trump	It's been an incredible story.
354	Donald Trump	It's been an incredible story.
355	Donald Trump	Great job.
356	Donald Trump	To get relief to working families, we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history, the largest.
357	Donald Trump	We doubled, the child-tax credit, and the typical family of four earning $75,000 has seen a tax cut of over $2,000 a year, and that money goes right back into our economy.
358	Donald Trump	Our record-breaking regulatory reduction campaign has saved every American household an average of $3,000 per year, and we've ended the last administration's cruel and heartless law on American energy.
359	Donald Trump	What they were doing to our energy should never be forgotten.
360	Donald Trump	The United States is now the No.1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.
361	Donald Trump	And something I want to make clear to the media, we have among the cleanest and sharpest, crystal-clean, you've heard me say it, I went crystal-clean air and water anywhere on Earth.
362	Donald Trump	We are creating a future of American energy independence and yet our air and water are the cleanest they've ever been by far, and importantly, we are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.
363	Donald Trump	When I came into office, we inherited one of the worst trade deals ever negotiated, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
364	Donald Trump	Would it put you all out of work?
365	Donald Trump	TPP would have dealt the death blow to the US auto industry, which, by the way is doing great.
366	Donald Trump	Many, many plants are now under construction in Michigan and Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, they hadn't built one in decades and now they're all over the place.
367	Donald Trump	In my first week, I withdrew the United States from the job-killing catastrophe that we know what that is: TPP and the Paris environmental accord, not too good, not too good.
368	Donald Trump	I thought I was going to take a lot of heat on that, I took none.
369	Donald Trump	Would have cost us trillions and trillions of dollars.
370	Donald Trump	And we're replacing the NAFTA disaster with the brand new USMCA.
371	Donald Trump	And USMCA, that's Mexico and Canada, will create at least 75,000 new jobs for American auto workers and give a massive boost to our farmers and ranchers, and growers all across the Sunshine State and will hopefully soon have bipartisan support.
372	Donald Trump	Because everybody wants it to happen.
373	Donald Trump	It replaces one of the worst trade deals ever made, NAFTA.
374	Donald Trump	NAFTA was a beauty.
375	Donald Trump	It was really good if you want to see everybody leave our country.
376	Donald Trump	Thanks to our tariffs, american steel mills are roaring back to life, you know that.
377	Donald Trump	And we've taken historic action to confront china's chronic trading abuses.
378	Donald Trump	It should have been done a long time ago, but the days of stealing American jobs and American companies, American ideas and wealth, those days are over.
379	Donald Trump	In the eight years before I took office, on average, we lost two thousand manufacturing jobs a month.
380	Donald Trump	Since my inauguration, we've added 16,000 manufacturing jobs a month.
381	Donald Trump	That didn't happen by accident.
382	Donald Trump	Remember the statement from the previous administration you'd need a magic wand to bring back manufacturing.
383	Donald Trump	Well, we'll tell sleepy Joe that we found the magic wand.
384	Donald Trump	The sleepy guy.
385	Donald Trump	And to remedy past injustices, we passed groundbreaking criminal justice reform.
386	Donald Trump	We ended the Clinton era crime policies that unfairly affected the African-American community, so unfair.
387	Donald Trump	We are boldly confronting the opioid and drug addiction, and you know what's happening, drug addiction is the scorch of our country and many other countries, and we have made so much progress, so much progress.
388	Donald Trump	Opioid down 17, 18, 19, and 21% in some places.
389	Donald Trump	And I want to thank our first lady for having worked so hard on that, thank you, thank you.
390	Donald Trump	And we're expanding, affordable health care, creating plans 60% cheaper than Obamacare, and we passed, something I'm very proud of, they've wanted to pass it for 45 years.
391	Donald Trump	All of the gentlemen that are sitting here from Congress, your congressmen, your senators, they helped us.
392	Donald Trump	It's called Right To Try.
393	Donald Trump	We have the greatest medical labs in the world.
394	Donald Trump	We have incredible things under advisement, and our people, if they were very sick, they were terminally ill.
395	Donald Trump	They couldn't get anything because people said no, it might hurt them, they're terminally ill.
396	Donald Trump	So I said that doesn't make sense, and these people, if they were rich or had money they'd go to Asia, they'd go to Europe, they'd go all over the world looking for a cure, because the FDA would not approve what we call Right To Try, what a beautiful name, Right To Try, and I got it approved after 44 years, I got it approved.
397	Donald Trump	And I saw a beautiful young woman the other day on television, Miss Harp, incredible woman.
398	Donald Trump	Did anyone see her?
399	Donald Trump	She was incredible, and she was so thankful that she's doing so well and they were giving her instructions on what you do when you're dying, and then all of a sudden this happened, and now it looks like she's going to be around for a long time, and there are many, many cases right there.
400	Donald Trump	Right To Try.
401	Donald Trump	And I hope nobody in this room ever needs it, but we now have it.
402	Donald Trump	For the first time in half a century, we've reduced the price of prescription drugs and our amazing veterans are no longer left to languish and die on endless waiting lists, standing on line waiting for a doctor.
403	Donald Trump	We pass V.A.
404	Donald Trump	Choice, so they can see their doctor.
405	Donald Trump	Our veterans were waiting on line for two days, seven days, three weeks, five weeks, you had veterans waiting on line that could have easily been taken care of.
406	Donald Trump	They waited so long.
407	Donald Trump	they became terminally ill in many cases, the stories are horrible.
408	Donald Trump	We passed V.A.
409	Donald Trump	choice.
410	Donald Trump	You go out now, you get a doctor, you fix yourself up, the doctor sends us the bill, we pay for it, and you know what it doesn't matter, because the life and the veteran is more important, but we also happen to save a lot of money doing that, can you believe it?
411	Donald Trump	V.A.
412	Donald Trump	Choice for the veteran.
413	Donald Trump	They've been trying to get that passed also for about 44 years.
414	Donald Trump	Now we also passed V.A.
415	Donald Trump	accountability so that when somebody does bad things or mistreats, our wonderful veterans, we couldn't do anything with them.
416	Donald Trump	They were protected between civil service unions and all of the problems, it didn't matter, you couldn't do anything.
417	Donald Trump	Now, you can just say, "You're fired, get out, get out, get out."
418	Donald Trump	And as we fight to make life better for all Americans, the Democrat Party has become more radical, more dangerous and more unhinged than at any point in the modern history of our country or no issue are Democrats more extreme and more depraved than when it comes to border security.
419	Donald Trump	The Democrat agenda of open borders is morally reprehensible.
420	Donald Trump	It's the greatest betrayal of the American middle class and, frankly, American life.
421	Donald Trump	Our country, has a hole, nobody sees anything like it, people are pouring in, but we've stopped them, and now, as I said, we have other people helping us, including the country of Mexico.
422	Donald Trump	Let's see how it works out, but we need you to call your Democrat Congressman and your Democrat Senator and get them to pass legislation.
423	Donald Trump	Working with these great men over here to close up the loopholes and to solve the asylum problem which can be done in 15 minutes.
424	Donald Trump	Illegal mass migration brings in millions of low wage workers to compete for jobs, wages and opportunities against the most vulnerable Americans cutting off their path to the American dream.
425	Donald Trump	Thanks to Democrat policies, schoolchildren across the country are being threatened by the vicious gang MS-13.
426	Donald Trump	That iCE, by the way, is taking out of our country and dropping them back home by the thousands, by the thousands.
427	Donald Trump	Mass illegal migration, reduces living standards and strains public resources.
428	Donald Trump	If Democrat officials had to send their children to those overcrowded overburdened schools, they would not tolerate it for one minute.
429	Donald Trump	What's happening with their policies are horrible.
430	Donald Trump	Our immigration laws are a disgrace and the Democrats can get together with the Republicans and solve the problem quickly.
431	Donald Trump	One meeting.
432	Donald Trump	Democrats in California even voted to give free health care to illegal aliens instead of helping homeless Americans in Democrat run cities.
433	Donald Trump	Democrats support sanctuary cities.
434	Donald Trump	Thank you, Governor Ron, for ending that whole disaster.
435	Donald Trump	They release dangerous criminal aliens into our communities.
436	Donald Trump	Ron DeSantis, great job.
437	Donald Trump	Great.
438	Donald Trump	Really great, thank you.
439	Donald Trump	So small.
440	Donald Trump	It's commonsense.
441	Donald Trump	It's commonsense.
442	Donald Trump	Sanctuary cities are an open attack on American law enforcement and American families.
443	Donald Trump	Sacrificing American lives in pursuit of a callous political agenda.
444	Donald Trump	That's all it is.
445	Donald Trump	No one who supports sanctuary cities should be allowed to run for president of the United States, Republicans believe welfare, schools, hospitals, and public resources should be protected for all Americans.
446	Donald Trump	And yes, yes, we are doing things that few others have even tried to do we are making progress like nobody would believe.
447	Donald Trump	Wait 'til you see some of the things that you're going to be hearing about over the next few months.
448	Donald Trump	We believe our country should be a sanctuary for law abiding citizens not for criminal aliens, and we will always support and protect the heroes of ICE border patrol and law enforcement generally throughout our country.
449	Donald Trump	Thank you.
450	Donald Trump	And in the ultimate act of moral cowardice, not one Democrat candidate for president, not a single one, has stood up to defend the incredible men and women of ICE and border patrol, the job they do is incredible, against all odds with the bad laws.
451	Donald Trump	They don't have the character, the virtue, the spine to do it, we have to thank them and we have to thank, boy, law enforcement.
452	Donald Trump	What a job they do.
453	Donald Trump	It's time to pass Kate's Law, end sanctuary cities, end catch and release, deport vicious gang members, which we're doing, stop human trafficking, stop illegal immigration, and establish a modern immigration system based on skills contributions and based on merit.
454	Donald Trump	We want people to come into our country based on merit more than 120 Democrats in Congress have also signed up to support crazy Bernie Sanders socialist government takeover of healthcare.
455	Donald Trump	He seems not to be doing too well lately.
456	Donald Trump	They want to end Medicare as we know it and terminate the private health insurance of 180 million Americans who love their health insurance.
457	Donald Trump	America will never be a socialist country, ever.
458	Donald Trump	Republicans do not believe in socialism, we believe in freedom, and so do you.
459	Donald Trump	We will defend Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors.
460	Donald Trump	We will defend it like nobody else.
461	Donald Trump	And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.
462	Donald Trump	Always, always.
463	Donald Trump	Virtually, every top Democrat also now supports taxpayer-funded abortion right up to the moment of birth.
464	Donald Trump	Ripping baby straight from the mother's womb, leading Democrats have even opposed measures to prevent the execution of children after birth.
465	Donald Trump	You saw that.
466	Donald Trump	In Virginia, republicans believe that every life is a sacred gift from God.
467	Donald Trump	That is why I have asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion.
468	Donald Trump	Day by day, we are rebuilding our country, our home, we are restoring America's standing all around the world.
469	Donald Trump	We are respected as a country again.
470	Donald Trump	After past leaders slash military budgets, we are rebuilding the U.S armed forces with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year, far more than ever before.
471	Donald Trump	And with the help of Vice President Mike Pence, we are creating the space force, that's where it's going to be, the space force.
472	Donald Trump	We're insisting that our foreign partners and allies pay their fair share, and thanks to our brave warriors, the ISIS caliphate that you've been hearing so much about, has been totally obliterated 100%.
473	Donald Trump	We have repaired America's friendship with our cherished ally, the state of Israel.
474	Donald Trump	And as I heard, Mike, saying before, we recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem and we recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.
475	Donald Trump	And I withdrew the United States from the disaster -- i's a disaster, a disaster, the disastrous Iran nuclear deal and imposed the toughest ever sanctions on the world's No.
476	Donald Trump	1 state sponsor of terrorism.
477	Donald Trump	We're charting a path to stability and peace in the Middle East, because great nations do not want to fight endless wars.
478	Donald Trump	They've been going on forever.
479	Donald Trump	Starting to remove a lot of troops.
480	Donald Trump	We're finally putting America first.
481	Donald Trump	In Latin America, our country once again stands against corrupt communist and socialist regimes, and we support the people of Cuba and Venezuela in their righteous struggle for freedom.
482	Donald Trump	Thank you, Marco.
483	Donald Trump	Thank you, Rick.
484	Donald Trump	Thank you, Lindsey.
485	Donald Trump	And nothing would make us happier than to be able to work with Democrats to rebuild our nation's infrastructure, to bring down drug prices, to compete with other countries and to dominate the future as one American team.
486	Donald Trump	It can happen.
487	Donald Trump	It can happen, it can happen.
488	Donald Trump	It's looking like the Democratic Party does not want to do that, but it can happen, and it very well might.
489	Donald Trump	There's so many great things we can do right now in a bipartisan way, but they've been afflicted with an ideological sectors that protects foreign borders, but refuses to protect our borders that promotes jobs overseas, but allows our factories to close, that promotes democracy abroad, but shreds our Constitution at home.
490	Donald Trump	That declares support for free speech and free thought, but relentlessly suppresses them both and that constantly savages the heroes of American law enforcement.
491	Donald Trump	We don't want that, we don't want that.
492	Donald Trump	No matter what label they use.
493	Donald Trump	A vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream.
494	Donald Trump	So don't ever forget, this election is about you.
495	Donald Trump	It's about your family, your future and the fate of your country.
496	Donald Trump	We begin our campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for our country's future.
497	Donald Trump	Together, we will continue unleashing the power of American enterprise, so every American can know the dignity of work and the pride of a paycheck.
498	Donald Trump	We will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, and lawful system of immigration.
499	Donald Trump	It will be a system of immigration that strengthens our country, upholds our values and protects our way of life.
500	Donald Trump	We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are promptly stamped with the words Made in the U.S.A. We will create a great health care system based on honesty, transparency, more options, and far lower costs for much better care.
501	Donald Trump	We will give school choice to millions of underserved children who are trapped in failing schools and failing school system.
502	Donald Trump	We will continue rescuing our inner cities from disastrous reign of Democrats, who presided over the decimation of their education systems, the outsourcing of their jobs, and the devastation of their neighborhoods.
503	Donald Trump	We will expand opportunity zones so that no community is ever left behind.
504	Donald Trump	Thank you, Tim Scott, great help.
505	Donald Trump	In the face of new threats, we will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms.
506	Donald Trump	We will protect our Second Amendment.
507	Donald Trump	We will push onward with new medical frontiers.
508	Donald Trump	We will come up with the cures to many, many problems, to many, many diseases, including cancer and others, and we're getting closer all the time.
509	Donald Trump	We will eradicate AIDS in America once and for all and we're very close.
510	Donald Trump	We will lay the foundation for landing American astronauts on the surface of Mars and, above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that hold us together.
511	Donald Trump	As one America, we believe in the American Constitution and the rule of law.
512	Donald Trump	We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life.
513	Donald Trump	We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way.
514	Donald Trump	We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag, and we will live by the words of our national motto: In God we Trust.
515	Donald Trump	Powered by these values, we won a victory two and a half years ago, we won a victory for every parent worried for their children and worried about their children.
516	Donald Trump	They were concerned that their children wouldn't have the same opportunity as they had, we're going to make that opportunity even better.
517	Donald Trump	We won a victory for every mom and dad who lost a job, because our leaders wave the white flag of economic surrender, you've seen that too much.
518	Donald Trump	We won a victory for American self-government, self rule and self determination.
519	Donald Trump	We have been blessed by God with the greatest nation on the face of the earth and we are going to keep it that way.
520	Donald Trump	We are going to keep it that way.
521	Donald Trump	With your help, with your love and your devotion and with your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.
522	Donald Trump	We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God.
523	Donald Trump	And together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again and we will make America great again.
524	Donald Trump	Thank you, Orlando.
525	Donald Trump	Thank you.
526	Donald Trump	Florida.
