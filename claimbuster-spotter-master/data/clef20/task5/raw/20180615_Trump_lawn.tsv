1	Steve Doocy	You've got some excitement out on your lawn today.
2	Steve Doocy	Hello, Mr. President.
3	Donald Trump	A little excitement.
4	Steve Doocy	What brings you here?
5	Donald Trump	Are we on already?
6	Steve Doocy	We're on.
7	Steve Doocy	We're live.
8	Donald Trump	Wow, wow.
9	Donald Trump	That's good.
10	Steve Doocy	We're actually -- we're on every channel.
11	Donald Trump	We had a very exciting trip over here, I have to say.
12	Steve Doocy	No kidding.
13	Donald Trump	I was good.
14	Donald Trump	It was good.
15	Donald Trump	How are you?
16	Steve Doocy	I'm doing OK.
17	Steve Doocy	I was here for the baseball game.
18	Steve Doocy	How about Steve Scalise last night?
19	Donald Trump	I think he's great.
20	Donald Trump	How about that play?
21	Donald Trump	The first play of the game.
22	Steve Doocy	Unbelievable.
23	Donald Trump	He's a great guy.
24	Donald Trump	Courageous.
25	Steve Doocy	He couldn't...
26	Donald Trump	Courageous.
27	Steve Doocy	Right.
28	Donald Trump	Like you.
29	Steve Doocy	Yes, sure.
30	Steve Doocy	Having you stop by live.
31	Steve Doocy	I got some questions.
32	Donald Trump	I was mugged by the media.
33	Steve Doocy	They've got questions for you.
34	Steve Doocy	I'm hoping I can ask a lot of the questions.
35	Steve Doocy	They've got...
36	Donald Trump	Very nice people.
37	Steve Doocy	You know, the I.G.
38	Steve Doocy	report came out yesterday.
39	Steve Doocy	The FBI looked bad.
40	Donald Trump	Very bad.
41	Steve Doocy	Your FBI.
42	Donald Trump	Well, no.
43	Donald Trump	It was Comey having to do -- talking about Comey, not my FBI.
44	Donald Trump	It was Comey.
45	Donald Trump	The people in the FBI are incredible.
46	Donald Trump	I would bet if you took a poll in the FBI, I would win that poll by more than anybody's ever won a poll.
47	Donald Trump	But the top people were horrible.
48	Donald Trump	You look at what happened: They were plotting against my election.
49	Donald Trump	Probably has never happened like that in terms of intelligence, in terms of anything else.
50	Donald Trump	But they were actually plotting against my election.
51	Steve Doocy	The headline right now...
52	Donald Trump	I'm actually proud, because I beat the Clinton dynasty...
53	Steve Doocy	Right.
54	Donald Trump	...I beat Bush dynasty, and now I guess hopefully I'm in the process of beating very dishonest intelligence.
55	Donald Trump	Because what they did was incredible and a real insult to millions of people that voted in that election on both sides.
56	Steve Doocy	The headline right now from the Wall Street Journal, "DOJ Clinton Report Blasts Comey And Agents But Finds No Bias In Conclusion."
57	Donald Trump	Well, the end result was wrong.
58	Donald Trump	I mean, there was total bias.
59	Donald Trump	I mean, when you look at Peter Strzok and what he said about me, when you look at Comey all his moves.
60	Donald Trump	So I guess -- you know it's interesting it was a pretty good report, and then I say that the I.G.
61	Donald Trump	blew it at the very end with that statement, because when you read the report it was almost like Comey.
62	Donald Trump	He goes point after point about how guilty Hillary is and then he said, "But we're not going to do anything about it."
63	Donald Trump	The report -- the I.G.
64	Donald Trump	report was a horror show.
65	Donald Trump	I thought that one sentence of conclusion was ridiculous.
66	Steve Doocy	What about, apparently, the love birds talking about you, "We will stop it"?
67	Donald Trump	Yeah, they said they will stop me.
68	Donald Trump	While in the meantime the economy hit an all-time high this morning.
69	Donald Trump	Never been better.
70	Donald Trump	Jobless rate the lowest -- the best in 44 years, just came out.
71	Donald Trump	We're going to have some incredible things.
72	Donald Trump	We're just announcing very big tariffs today on China because China has been -- look he's my friend, President Xi.
73	Donald Trump	He's a great man.
74	Donald Trump	He's a wonderful guy.
75	Donald Trump	But at some point we have to straighten it out.
76	Donald Trump	We lost $500 billion in trade deficits last year.
77	Donald Trump	We can't do that.
78	Steve Doocy	Is the new tariff something like 25 percent on...
79	Donald Trump	It's being announced right now as I speak.
80	Steve Doocy	OK. You can announce it.
81	Donald Trump	Maybe you have the first announcement.
82	Donald Trump	You may...
83	Steve Doocy	What do you know about your tariffs?
84	Donald Trump	You might beat the Wall Street Journal, all right.
85	Donald Trump	You just beat the Wall Street Journal by a lot.
86	Donald Trump	Well, we're just going to do $50 billion on $50 billion of high-technology equipment and other things coming into the country, because so much of our secrets -- you know, we have the great brain power in Silicon Valley, and China and others steal those secrets.
87	Donald Trump	And we're going protect those secrets.
88	Donald Trump	Those are crown jewels for this country.
89	Donald Trump	And, you know, you read so much about China, you read so much about other countries, we have the great brainpower right in this country, I'm proud to say.
90	Donald Trump	And you're certainly a member of that group.
91	Steve Doocy	I'm an America.
92	Steve Doocy	What about the fact that there are a lot of people that say, "What's he doing?
93	Steve Doocy	He's going to start a trade war?
94	Steve Doocy	If he slaps 25 percent on $50 billion for China that's going to be bad for Americans"?
95	Donald Trump	No, the trade war was started many years ago by them and the United States lost.
96	Donald Trump	There's no trade war...
97	Steve Doocy	So you're saying we're on the losing end of it?
98	Donald Trump	Well, no.
99	Donald Trump	There is no trade war.
100	Donald Trump	They've taken so much.
101	Donald Trump	So last year $375 billion in trade deficit.
102	Donald Trump	We had a 300 -- with China.
103	Donald Trump	We had overall over $800 billion over a period of years -- each year close to $800 billion in losses on trade.
104	Donald Trump	Not going to happen anymore.
105	Donald Trump	It's not going to happen.
106	Donald Trump	Can't happen.
107	Steve Doocy	A week ago you were up in -- up in Canada and you met with the G-7 people.
108	Donald Trump	I was.
109	Steve Doocy	That didn't end so well.
110	Donald Trump	Oh, it ended well.
111	Donald Trump	For the United States, it ended well.
112	Steve Doocy	Well, the world community thinks the United States is turning our back on them.
113	Donald Trump	No, no.
114	Steve Doocy	But your opinion is that it's you got elected to represent America and America needs help.
115	Donald Trump	We need protection.
116	Donald Trump	Everybody's taking advantage of us.
117	Donald Trump	The European Union made $151 billion on us last year.
118	Donald Trump	The -- if you look at -- I told you about China.
119	Donald Trump	You look at Japan, you look at South Korea, you look at so many -- and we help these countries militarily on top of everything else.
120	Donald Trump	I mean, you know, at what point does it stop?
121	Donald Trump	And when I left China, it was absolutely a fantastic meeting.
122	Donald Trump	We left, we hugged, we kissed.
123	Donald Trump	Everybody was leaving, and then I get onto Air Force One and the prime minister up there, Trudeau, didn't think, I guess, that we have any televisions on Air Force One.
124	Donald Trump	But they have, I think, 21 televisions or some ridiculous number...
125	Steve Doocy	And so, you saw it and you hit the roof.
126	Donald Trump	Well, you have to understand, we're hugging, we're saying goodbye, everybody's happy.
127	Donald Trump	I made changes to the agreement because I wanted it to be much better for the United States.
128	Donald Trump	I made changes.
129	Donald Trump	We're all happy.
130	Donald Trump	And then he got up and started saying that he doesn't want to be pushed around by the United States.
131	Donald Trump	Well, they charge us almost 300 percent on dairy products.
132	Steve Doocy	Right.
133	Donald Trump	So, we can't do that.
134	Steve Doocy	Have you heard from any of the G-7...
135	Donald Trump	Yeah.
136	Donald Trump	They all called me to wish me happy birthday yesterday.
137	Steve Doocy	Really?
138	Steve Doocy	And how was that?
139	Donald Trump	It was very...
140	Steve Doocy	Not your birthday, but the message from the other side.
141	Donald Trump	I took it very well.
142	Steve Doocy	Right.
143	Donald Trump	No, they all called.
144	Donald Trump	I mean, I have great friendships.
145	Donald Trump	The new prime minister of Italy is great.
146	Donald Trump	Got to meet him.
147	Donald Trump	Very -- very strong on immigration...
148	Steve Doocy	Right.
149	Donald Trump	...like I am, by the way.
150	Donald Trump	It seems that strong on immigration wins now.
151	Steve Doocy	Sure.
152	Steve Doocy	But this is...
153	Donald Trump	But the Democrats, by the way, are very weak on immigration.
154	Donald Trump	If you notice when I came over, they were all saying about separating the families and that's a Democrat bill.
155	Donald Trump	That's Democrats wanting to do that, and they could solve it very easily by getting together.
156	Donald Trump	But they think it's a good election point.
157	Donald Trump	I think it's a horrible election point for them.
158	Steve Doocy	Ultimately Congress has got to change the laws...
159	Donald Trump	They got to change the law.
160	Steve Doocy	...but at the same time, Mr. President, people say, "Look, you rip these families apart.
161	Steve Doocy	Even though it is the law, it's heartless."
162	Donald Trump	But that's the law.
163	Donald Trump	And that's what the Democrats gave us.
164	Donald Trump	And we're willing to change it today if they want to get in and negotiate, but the just don't want to negotiate.
165	Donald Trump	They're afraid of -- they're afraid of security for our country.
166	Donald Trump	They're afraid of a wall.
167	Donald Trump	Although I must tell you, most people now really -- they want the wall, they want to stop the drugs, they want to stop a lot of people from coming in that shouldn't be here, like MS-13.
168	Steve Doocy	Right.
169	Steve Doocy	A lot of -- I was up on Capitol Hill yesterday with Steve Scalise.
170	Steve Doocy	They were having a leadership meeting.
171	Steve Doocy	It sounds like they were going to take a vote on a couple of different bills on immigration probably next week.
172	Donald Trump	Yeah.
173	Steve Doocy	One of them the Goodlatte bill, the other is something more moderate.
174	Steve Doocy	Would you sign either one of those?
175	Donald Trump	I'm looking at both of them.
176	Donald Trump	I certainly wouldn't sign the more moderate one.
177	Steve Doocy	What does the bill have to have in it?
178	Donald Trump	I -- I need a bill that gives this country tremendous border security.
179	Donald Trump	I have to have that.
180	Donald Trump	We have to get rid of catch-and-release.
181	Steve Doocy	Got to have the wall?
182	Steve Doocy	Does that mean the wall?
183	Donald Trump	We have to have the wall.
184	Donald Trump	If we don't have the wall, there's no bill.
185	Donald Trump	We have to have catch-and-release.
186	Donald Trump	We catch a criminal, a real criminal, a rough tough criminal, we take his name and then we release him.
187	Donald Trump	And we say, "Please show up to court in a couple of months."
188	Donald Trump	You know what the chances of getting him to court are?
189	Donald Trump	Like zero.
190	Donald Trump	OK.
191	Donald Trump	It's crazy.
192	Donald Trump	Then we have the lottery program, right?
193	Donald Trump	It's called lotter-visery.
194	Steve Doocy	Diversity Lottery Program.
195	Donald Trump	Yes, well, the lottery visa.
196	Steve Doocy	OK. One of the...
197	Donald Trump	OK, whatever.
198	Donald Trump	They have fifty names.
199	Donald Trump	Still -- everyone of them has lottery.
200	Donald Trump	Do you know what lottery is?
201	Donald Trump	That's when you pick names to come into the country.
202	Donald Trump	Well, when a country gives names, they're not giving us their finest.
203	Donald Trump	So we're picking people, it's not good.
204	Donald Trump	We have to end that.
205	Donald Trump	We have to end a couple of them and we are going to be so secure as a country.
206	Donald Trump	Now, with all of that being said, we're doing a great job.
207	Donald Trump	ICE -- we're getting MS-13 out by the thousands.
208	Donald Trump	But we shouldn't have to be going into towns in Long Island and other places and getting them out.
209	Donald Trump	You know, it's almost like we're liberating towns.
210	Donald Trump	It's incredible.
211	Steve Doocy	You mentioned court.
212	Steve Doocy	Regarding a legal proceeding, you got Robert -- the -- the Mueller investigation.
213	Steve Doocy	I know we, kind of, touched on that a little while ago.
214	Steve Doocy	Rudy Giuliani is out this morning.
215	Steve Doocy	He said the investigation should go away.
216	Steve Doocy	Time to fold up the tent.
217	Steve Doocy	Or it's time to investigate the investigators.
218	Steve Doocy	Are you on the same page...
219	Donald Trump	Look, we have 13 angry Democrats.
220	Donald Trump	There are -- I call them 13 angry Democrats, and others worked for Obama for eight years.
221	Donald Trump	I mean, they have no Republicans, you have no -- it's a very unfair situation.
222	Donald Trump	But the I.G.
223	Donald Trump	report totally exonerates -- I mean, if you look at the results and if you look at the head investigator is saying, "We have to stop Trump from becoming president," well, Trump became president and we have the best economy today we've ever had.
224	Steve Doocy	Right.
225	Donald Trump	We have much greater border security than we ever would have had.
226	Steve Doocy	Right.
227	Donald Trump	And when we do it -- when we have the laws changed, it'll be like perfecto.
228	Steve Doocy	Rudy says that you should not talk to a lawyer.
229	Donald Trump	A lot of people say that.
230	Donald Trump	Look...
231	Steve Doocy	Getting the I.G.
232	Steve Doocy	report and stuff that's going on.
233	Donald Trump	They're getting people who say something a little bit off.
234	Donald Trump	Is it a nice day?
235	Donald Trump	Well, you know, no, it's not a great day.
236	Donald Trump	Oops, you lied.
237	Donald Trump	He goes -- you know, got problems.
238	Steve Doocy	What...
239	Donald Trump	People are afraid of that.
240	Donald Trump	And I would like to talk, but it seems to be very biased.
241	Steve Doocy	One of -- some of the texts -- and we're not going to quote them -- were very...
242	Donald Trump	Vicious.
243	Steve Doocy	...vicious regarding people who support you.
244	Donald Trump	Vicious.
245	Donald Trump	I have the greatest supporters in the world.
246	Donald Trump	By the way, they're the smartest.
247	Donald Trump	They're the hardest working.
248	Donald Trump	They pay taxes.
249	Donald Trump	They're incredible.
250	Donald Trump	They're loyal.
251	Donald Trump	I have the bikers.
252	Donald Trump	I have the -- the construction workers.
253	Steve Doocy	Right.
254	Donald Trump	I have them all.
255	Donald Trump	I have -- by the way, I have the FBI.
256	Donald Trump	You go into the FBI and take a poll of the real FBI, not the scum on top, not Comey and that group of people that are total thieves...
257	Steve Doocy	Most of those are gone.
258	Donald Trump	Well, I don't know how Peter Strzok is still working there, to be honest with you, OK.
259	Steve Doocy	He's working in H.R.
260	Steve Doocy	This is...
261	Donald Trump	That's even worse.
262	Steve Doocy	Mr. President, this is your FBI.
263	Donald Trump	I know.
264	Donald Trump	But do you know what I've done?
265	Donald Trump	And you know this.
266	Donald Trump	I've told you this.
267	Donald Trump	I'm so involved.
268	Donald Trump	Great new secretary of state.
269	Steve Doocy	Right.
270	Donald Trump	Just -- I have a fantastic relationship now with North Korea.
271	Donald Trump	You know, there were missiles being thrown about.
272	Steve Doocy	Yeah.
273	Donald Trump	People aren't thinking about it anymore.
274	Donald Trump	I said on the Department of Justice, I would stay uninvolved.
275	Donald Trump	Now, I may get involved at some point if it gets worse.
276	Donald Trump	I say I'm staying uninvolved.
277	Donald Trump	I'm letting this report go through.
278	Donald Trump	I did nothing wrong.
279	Donald Trump	There was no collusion.
280	Donald Trump	There was no obstruction.
281	Donald Trump	There was no one...
282	Steve Doocy	But, Mr. President, I was on Capitol Hill yesterday, and there are a number of congressional Republicans who are -- you know, they're trying to get some documents from your Department of Justice, your FBI.
283	Donald Trump	I tried to stay involved.
284	Donald Trump	I may not stay involved, again -- uninvolved.
285	Donald Trump	Because they have to get the documents.
286	Donald Trump	Look, I think everybody...
287	Steve Doocy	But your FBI is stonewalling.
288	Donald Trump	I think that Road -- Rog...
289	Steve Doocy	Rosenstein.
290	Donald Trump	...Rosenstein thinks that you have to get the documents.
291	Donald Trump	I really believe that.
292	Donald Trump	I saw him yesterday.
293	Donald Trump	He gave me a briefing.
294	Donald Trump	It think that he believes you have to get the documents.
295	Steve Doocy	What did he say regarding the I.G.
296	Steve Doocy	report?
297	Donald Trump	Well, he wasn't thrilled about it.
298	Donald Trump	I mean, you know, you can't be if you're in there now.
299	Donald Trump	But it really was talking about the past.
300	Donald Trump	It's not talking about us.
301	Donald Trump	It's talking about before us.
302	Donald Trump	And it's talking about the election.
303	Donald Trump	What they did during the election was a disgrace.
304	Donald Trump	It's probably never happened in our country before.
305	Donald Trump	And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
306	Donald Trump	What's going to happen when we go further?
307	Donald Trump	And there was total bias.
308	Donald Trump	I mean, total bias.
309	Steve Doocy	From what you've seen so far, should James Comey be locked up?
310	Donald Trump	Well, look, I would never want to get involved in that.
311	Donald Trump	Certainly he -- they just seem like very criminal acts to me.
312	Donald Trump	What he did was criminal.
313	Donald Trump	What he did was a terrible thing to people.
314	Donald Trump	What he did was so bad in terms of our Constitution, in terms of the well-being of our country.
315	Donald Trump	What he did was horrible.
316	Donald Trump	Should he be locked up?
317	Donald Trump	Let somebody make a determination.
318	Donald Trump	Look at all the dishonest things that crooked Hillary did.
319	Donald Trump	Look at -- look at what -- what's gone on.
320	Donald Trump	It's very sad.
321	Steve Doocy	Sounds like he was using a private e-mail, too.
322	Donald Trump	He had a private e-mail.
323	Donald Trump	That was -- of all the things, that wasn't to me maybe the most interesting, but it was probably the funniest.
324	Steve Doocy	Because she got in big trouble for her private e-mail.
325	Steve Doocy	Oh, James Comey's using one, too.
326	Donald Trump	That was a little bit of a surprise, I have to say.
327	Steve Doocy	Yeah.
328	Steve Doocy	From what we've seen, though, regarding the I.G.
329	Steve Doocy	report, it -- it sounds like Comey made some bad judgments but nothing criminal.
330	Donald Trump	Well, if you look at what happened -- and don't forget all of these people like Strzok, what he did was criminal, Strzok and so many others.
331	Donald Trump	McCabe is now...
332	Steve Doocy	Do you mean biased the analysts?
333	Donald Trump	Oh, they all work for Comey.
334	Donald Trump	And Comey knew everything that was going on.
335	Donald Trump	You think McCabe didn't tell him everything?
336	Donald Trump	McCabe told him everything, and McCabe is up for criminal right now.
337	Donald Trump	And most people...
338	Steve Doocy	And now he's suing the Department of Justice.
339	Donald Trump	And he's now suing.
340	Donald Trump	And it's a total mess.
341	Donald Trump	They're all going against each other.
342	Donald Trump	No, I -- I think Comey was the ringleader of this whole, you know, den of thieves.
343	Donald Trump	It was a den of thieves.
344	Steve Doocy	Are you confident that, either through the congressional investigators or the I.G.
345	Steve Doocy	report or new management at the -- at the FBI, things are going to work out..
346	Donald Trump	I think so.
347	Donald Trump	I think so.
348	Steve Doocy	...things are cleaning up and we'll get to the bottom of all that stuff?
349	Donald Trump	I do believe so.
350	Donald Trump	I think its happening.
351	Donald Trump	It's happening slowly, but it's happening.
352	Donald Trump	I think Christopher Wray's a -- very different from Comey.
353	Donald Trump	Which is what you need, you need different.
354	Donald Trump	You need, like, the opposite.
355	Donald Trump	And he's moving step by step.
356	Donald Trump	And you're going to see a whole new, very proud FBI.
357	Donald Trump	I think that the Justice Department will end up being great.
358	Donald Trump	It's all going to happen.
359	Donald Trump	It's all going to work out.
360	Donald Trump	But I tried to stay as much uninvolved as I can.
361	Steve Doocy	You were very involved in going to Singapore, negotiating with Kim Jong-un.
362	Donald Trump	Right.
363	Steve Doocy	When you finally met him and sat across the table from -- you know, we've heard a lot of bad things about little rocket man.
364	Steve Doocy	And suddenly you guys seem to be best friends.
365	Donald Trump	We got along very well.
366	Donald Trump	We had a good chemistry.
367	Donald Trump	I don't know if that's supposed to be popular or politically correct to say.
368	Donald Trump	But we really did.
369	Donald Trump	We had good chemistry.
370	Donald Trump	You haven't had any rockets shot up in the air for seven months.
371	Donald Trump	You haven't had any research.
372	Donald Trump	They just blew up their test site.
373	Donald Trump	They're blowing up their engine test site for ballistic missiles.
374	Donald Trump	He's giving us back our great heroes who died, as you know.
375	Steve Doocy	Right.
376	Donald Trump	We're getting their remains back.
377	Donald Trump	And I've had so many people, so many parents, so many fathers and daughters and sons asking me, "Please, please."
378	Steve Doocy	Right.
379	Donald Trump	This is during the campaign and after.
380	Donald Trump	I say, I don't have exactly a good relationship.
381	Donald Trump	Anyway, during the meeting -- and we really did hit it off.
382	Donald Trump	During the -- you know, good chemistry.
383	Steve Doocy	You -- you have since used some very friendly words regarding him.
384	Steve Doocy	And you're taking some heat for that.
385	Donald Trump	Yes.
386	Donald Trump	I mean, that's what it is.
387	Donald Trump	I take heat.
388	Donald Trump	But what am supposed to do, walk out and say "terrible"?
389	Donald Trump	I mean, I -- I got along with him very well.
390	Donald Trump	We have good chemistry.
391	Donald Trump	I asked him, "The remains; I'd like to get them."
392	Steve Doocy	Right
393	Donald Trump	He said, "Yes, we will do that."
394	Donald Trump	They are already starting to produce the remains of these great young soldiers who were left in North Korea.
395	Steve Doocy	Right.
396	Donald Trump	We're getting the remains, and nobody thought that was possible.
397	Steve Doocy	The way you have described things, it sounds like you feel that he's on the road to denuking.
398	Donald Trump	Oh, absolutely.
399	Donald Trump	It's in the agreement: It says he will denuclearize.
400	Steve Doocy	Right.
401	Steve Doocy	I know it's, kind of, broad...
402	Donald Trump	You know, it's funny -- it's funny when you see the fake news, because -- and you guys aren't fake.
403	Donald Trump	But I signed an agreement where we get everything.
404	Donald Trump	Everything.
405	Donald Trump	But they say "Trump lost because he agreed to meet.
406	Donald Trump	Trump agreed to meet."
407	Steve Doocy	Got the picture.
408	Donald Trump	No, it's a funny thing.
409	Donald Trump	You got to watch CNN.
410	Donald Trump	I mean, what -- what a fraud it is.
411	Donald Trump	They go, "Trump is..."
412	Steve Doocy	They're listening.
413	Steve Doocy	They're right behind you, right there.
414	Donald Trump	That's fine.
415	Donald Trump	Do you hear me?
416	Donald Trump	Trump agreed to meet.
417	Donald Trump	I say I agreed to meet.
418	Donald Trump	Of course you got to agree to meet.
419	Donald Trump	If you don't agree to meet, you know what you're going to have?
420	Donald Trump	You're going to have nuclear war, that's what you're going to have.
421	Donald Trump	I have a great relationship.
422	Donald Trump	He gave us back our hostages.
423	Donald Trump	I didn't pay $1.8 billion.
424	Donald Trump	I paid nothing.
425	Steve Doocy	Right.
426	Donald Trump	But it was very smart that he did it.
427	Donald Trump	He gave us back our hostages.
428	Donald Trump	He's giving us back the remains of probably 7,500 soldiers.
429	Steve Doocy	Really?
430	Donald Trump	Yeah.
431	Donald Trump	There's a tremendous number of soldiers.
432	Donald Trump	Tremendous number of MIAs, you know, folks that just never -- they've never been found.
433	Steve Doocy	It sounds like...
434	Donald Trump	And they -- and by the way, they know where many of these bodies are.
435	Steve Doocy	What -- what is the stage of the meetings now?
436	Steve Doocy	I know, you know...
437	Donald Trump	It's great.
438	Donald Trump	Mike Pompeo is just leaving there.
439	Donald Trump	He was in South Korea. Any developments
440	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
441	Donald Trump	?
442	Donald Trump	We're getting along great with South Korea.
443	Donald Trump	We're getting along great with China.
444	Donald Trump	Probably until this morning, because we just did a tariff in China.
445	Donald Trump	But that's OK, because I have a wonderful relationship with President Xi.
446	Donald Trump	We'll all work it out.
447	Donald Trump	He understands it's unfair.
448	Steve Doocy	Right.
449	Donald Trump	They can't believe they got away with it for so long, Steve.
450	Steve Doocy	Right.
451	Donald Trump	They can't believe it.
452	Donald Trump	I mean, they got away with it for 25 years.
453	Donald Trump	I'm not just blaming Obama.
454	Donald Trump	I'm blaming many presidents and leaders.
455	Steve Doocy	At what point...
456	Donald Trump	It should have never happened.
457	Steve Doocy	At what point do the sanctions come off of North Korea?
458	Donald Trump	When we can be sure there will be no more nuclear.
459	Steve Doocy	How close are we to that?
460	Donald Trump	Very close.
461	Donald Trump	We're very close to getting it started.
462	Donald Trump	He wants to do it.
463	Donald Trump	He wants to do something great with his country.
464	Donald Trump	He wants to make his country great.
465	Steve Doocy	So, you are saying that you'll relieve the sanctions once whatever he's going to do...
466	Donald Trump	Once we know...
467	Steve Doocy	...is completely -- that stuff doesn't work anymore.
468	Donald Trump	Once we know that it can't happen.
469	Steve Doocy	Right.
470	Donald Trump	And I'm telling you right now, with the relationship I have, it's not going to happen.
471	Donald Trump	Hey, you haven't had a rocket test in seven months.
472	Steve Doocy	Right.
473	Donald Trump	I was with Prime Minister Abe, another good friend of mine from Japan.
474	Donald Trump	I said, "When's the last time you had a rocket flying over Japan?"
475	Donald Trump	He said, "It has not happened."
476	Donald Trump	I said, "It won't happen.
477	Donald Trump	Don't worry about."
478	Steve Doocy	Right.
479	Steve Doocy	Are we close to seeing Mr. Kim here at the White House?
480	Donald Trump	It could happen.
481	Donald Trump	I mean, yeah, I would have him. Did they talk about that...
482	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]
483	Donald Trump	Yeah.
484	Donald Trump	I think it's something that could happen.
485	Donald Trump	Yeah.
486	Donald Trump	Hey, he's the head of a country.
487	Donald Trump	And I mean he is the strong head.
488	Donald Trump	Don't let anyone think anything different.
489	Steve Doocy	Right.
490	Donald Trump	He speaks and his people sit up at attention.
491	Donald Trump	I want my people to do the same.
492	Steve Doocy	Well, just before you met with him, he cleaned house.
493	Steve Doocy	Three of his top generals, some of the hardliners he fired.
494	Donald Trump	Yeah, that's what I hear.
495	Steve Doocy	Then you go over there.
496	Steve Doocy	And you got -- you took some heat over saluting one of the generals.
497	Donald Trump	I think he fired at least, OK, when you say he fired.
498	Steve Doocy	Three that we know of.
499	Donald Trump	I think maybe fired at least.
500	Donald Trump	Fired may be a nice word.
501	Donald Trump	That's right, I met a general.
502	Donald Trump	He saluted me, I saluted him back.
503	Donald Trump	And I guess their using that as another sound bite.
504	Donald Trump	I mean, you know, I think I'm being respectful to the general.
505	Donald Trump	We are -- we have a very good relationship with North Korea.
506	Steve Doocy	Right.
507	Donald Trump	When I was talking to President Obama, he essentially was ready to go to war with North Korea.
508	Donald Trump	He felt you had to almost go to war.
509	Donald Trump	And I did ask him: "Have you spoken to him?"
510	Donald Trump	He goes, "No."
511	Donald Trump	I said, "Do you think it would be a good thing to speak to him maybe?"
512	Steve Doocy	Right.
513	Donald Trump	OK. Because if you go to war there, you're not talking about 100,000 lives, which is a lot.
514	Steve Doocy	Right.
515	Donald Trump	You're talking about 30, 40, 50 million lives.
516	Steve Doocy	Sure.
517	Donald Trump	Seoul is 30 miles off the border.
518	Donald Trump	They don't even need nuclear weapons to take out Seoul.
519	Donald Trump	They have thousands of cannons -- they call them cannons; they have big guns -- thousands pointed right at Seoul.
520	Donald Trump	We have a really great relationship for the first time ever.
521	Donald Trump	No president's ever had this.
522	Donald Trump	So I get hit by these fakes back here.
523	Donald Trump	Not all of them.
524	Donald Trump	Some are phenomenal.
525	Donald Trump	But I get hit, because I went there, I gave him credibility.
526	Donald Trump	I think it's great to give him credibility.
527	Donald Trump	Here's what we got: everything, point after point after point.
528	Steve Doocy	One point, I think it was in the last week, 10 days, things are going faster in Washington, just saying.
529	Steve Doocy	But...
530	Donald Trump	We're having a lot of fun, right?
531	Donald Trump	So supposing Hillary got elected instead of Trump, do you think it would be so exciting?
532	Donald Trump	Your ratings would be way down.
533	Donald Trump	Number one show in the morning, folks.
534	Steve Doocy	Well, thank you.
535	Steve Doocy	I've heard you say the others -- in cable news.
536	Steve Doocy	That's right.
537	Steve Doocy	It was within the last...
538	Donald Trump	Actually also beyond cable news you're doing pretty well.
539	Steve Doocy	We're doing OK.
540	Steve Doocy	Thanks for dropping by...
541	Donald Trump	I like ratings. All the others
542	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
543	Donald Trump	.
544	Donald Trump	I study ratings, broadcasting.
545	Steve Doocy	You had mentioned the NFL players and the -- you know, some taking a knee.
546	Steve Doocy	And you would like to hear some of the stories of people who you should pardon.
547	Steve Doocy	And you mentioned professional athletes.
548	Steve Doocy	Have you heard from any of them?
549	Donald Trump	No.
550	Donald Trump	I haven't heard.
551	Donald Trump	You know, they were all saying, "Oh, it has nothing to do with the flag.
552	Donald Trump	It's the way we've been treated," and in the meantime they're making $15 million a year.
553	Donald Trump	Look, I'm all for the athletes.
554	Donald Trump	I think it's great.
555	Donald Trump	I love athletics.
556	Donald Trump	I love sports.
557	Donald Trump	But they shouldn't get the politics involved.
558	Donald Trump	When you're in a stadium and they broadcast that national anthem, you got to stand, and you got to be proud, and you got to have your hand up, and you got to do everything that's right.
559	Donald Trump	And then go out and play really tough football.
560	Donald Trump	And once you leave that stadium, go and do whatever you want to do.
561	Donald Trump	Run for office, or do whatever.
562	Donald Trump	But I did say, you know, I have this tremendous power of pardon.
563	Donald Trump	And Kim Kardashian came in, and the woman 22 years in jail
564	Steve Doocy	People can't believe that you would be listening to Kim Kardashian.
565	Donald Trump	Oh, I did.
566	Donald Trump	I don't know her, and I met her and she was really nice, I have to say, and very capable.
567	Donald Trump	But she came in and she said, "This is a very unfair situation."
568	Donald Trump	I looked at her and I agreed.
569	Donald Trump	Twenty -- she's in there for 22 years, she's got another 20 years to serve, and you have drug dealers that are doing big stuff and they get a two-month sentence, OK. You know, it was just unfair.
570	Donald Trump	And I thought it was a beautiful scene when that woman left prison and ran over to -- it looked like her grandkids, it was a couple of big strong guys.
571	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
572	Donald Trump	.
573	Donald Trump	Big strong guys, some wonderful women.
574	Donald Trump	They were all hugging and kissing and everyone's crying.
575	Donald Trump	To me that was a beautiful scene.
576	Donald Trump	Well, she thanked me but, you know, thanked Kim, because I wouldn't have known about it.
577	Steve Doocy	Yeah.
578	Donald Trump	And I told the NFL players, I mean, indirectly -- I said, "You have somebody that's aggrieved" -- because they're saying people are aggrieved, OK. "Let me know about it.
579	Donald Trump	I'll look at it.
580	Donald Trump	If they're aggrieved, I will pardon them, I'll get them out."
581	Steve Doocy	I'm shocked you haven't heard from a single one.
582	Donald Trump	I don't think I've from one.
583	Donald Trump	Now, maybe they've called the staff, but I have not personally heard from one.
584	Steve Doocy	Yeah.
585	Steve Doocy	Speaking of the staff...
586	Donald Trump	Because I don't know if it's a real issue.
587	Donald Trump	I don't think it's a real issue.
588	Steve Doocy	Sarah Huckabee Sanders, your press secretary, she's -- she took a lot of heat yesterday from the people behind you.
589	Donald Trump	Oh, she did?
590	Donald Trump	I didn't know that.
591	Steve Doocy	Well, she did.
592	Steve Doocy	There was some suggestion that maybe she'd be leaving the White House.
593	Donald Trump	I don't think so.
594	Donald Trump	You know, look at a certain point everyone, sort of, leaves.
595	Donald Trump	You have to leave.
596	Donald Trump	I'm, sort of, just standing -- I'm like a ship, just keep going, bing, bing.
597	Donald Trump	But Sarah loves this job and she's announced -- not with me, I read that same report.
598	Donald Trump	Somebody put it out, I think it was CBS -- when she said it's a false report.
599	Donald Trump	But it's fake news.
600	Donald Trump	But at some point I'm sure she'll leave, like everybody leaves and we'll get somebody else.
601	Donald Trump	But Sarah's done a fantastic job.
602	Donald Trump	No, I don't think she's leaving.
603	Steve Doocy	What do you make of the...
604	Donald Trump	In fact, she was very insulted that they came out and said that.
605	Steve Doocy	Right.
606	Donald Trump	So I don't think she's leaving.
607	Steve Doocy	What do you make of the back-and-forth between her and the press?
608	Steve Doocy	Because sometimes it gets loud.
609	Donald Trump	Well, I think the press -- I think the press treats Sarah very unfairly.
610	Donald Trump	That White House correspondent... But I think some of them feel she's not answering their questions, so they're going to ask it again and ask
611	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
612	Donald Trump	.
613	Donald Trump	Well, I gave a press conference in Singapore that was like an hour and a half, and that was like the biggest press group I've ever seen.
614	Donald Trump	And I answered every single question.
615	Donald Trump	I'd answer anybody's question.
616	Donald Trump	I guess that's not supposed to be my job.
617	Donald Trump	I'm here with you today, you're giving me a lot of...
618	Steve Doocy	Well, thank you very much.
619	Donald Trump	...lot of interesting questions.
620	Donald Trump	But -- but, Steve, I think Sarah is really a good person and a nice person, very capable.
621	Donald Trump	She's got a lot of the father's genes, because her father is great.
622	Steve Doocy	Mike.
623	Steve Doocy	OK.
624	Donald Trump	Don't forget he got up there on that debate stage and he said, "Nobody's going to beat Trump."
625	Donald Trump	And I even decided to -- he was running.
626	Donald Trump	And I even decided to wear a Trump tie.
627	Donald Trump	And I said, "I love that guy."
628	Donald Trump	I loved him, OK. Mike, is a very talented guy and Sarah's a very talented person.
629	Donald Trump	But they treat her very badly.
630	Donald Trump	What they did Sarah at the White House Correspondents -- now, the only difference I would have done, I would have walked out.
631	Donald Trump	I thought she should have walked out instead of sitting there.
632	Donald Trump	But, you know...
633	Steve Doocy	She took a high road.
634	Donald Trump	She took a very high road.
635	Donald Trump	Sometimes...
636	Steve Doocy	Yeah.
637	Donald Trump	...you don't take such a high road.
638	Steve Doocy	We had Stewart Varney on our air...
639	Donald Trump	By the way, he is great.
640	Donald Trump	I love Stewart.
641	Steve Doocy	That little part, he's going to be running every day now.
642	Donald Trump	No, I love him.
643	Donald Trump	And he's right.
644	Donald Trump	He knows what he's talking about.
645	Steve Doocy	Well, he suggested that the next quarter GDP could be 4 percent.
646	Donald Trump	Well, they're predicting -- you know, the Atlanta Fed predicted 4.8 percent.
647	Donald Trump	I think, you know, that's a lot.
648	Donald Trump	Don't forget, then I got elected, I took this thing over, it was 1.2 and each point is $3 trillion and 10 million jobs.
649	Donald Trump	You know, a point -- people will say at home, "Oh, it's a point, what difference does it make?"
650	Donald Trump	Well, it was 1.2 and it was going down.
651	Donald Trump	You probably saw this morning I put out, they would have raised your taxes instead of cut your taxes, and they were going to put on more regulations.
652	Donald Trump	The last thing we need is regulations.
653	Donald Trump	I actually think my regulation cutting had more of an impact on the economy than the tax cuts.
654	Steve Doocy	When you were running, you said, "For every regulation we enact, I will cut two."
655	Donald Trump	Right.
656	Steve Doocy	But you didn't cut two, you're cutting a much bigger number.
657	Donald Trump	Right.
658	Donald Trump	22, it turned out.
659	Donald Trump	22.
660	Donald Trump	And -- and by the way, you need regulation.
661	Donald Trump	I want the cleanest water in the world, I want the cleanest air in the world, I want that air to be so perfect.
662	Donald Trump	And our air now is better than it was two years ago, with all of the talk and the nonsense.
663	Donald Trump	Clean -- crystal clean water, clean air.
664	Donald Trump	But I also want our companies to be competitive so they can go around the world and compete.
665	Donald Trump	And we were shutting down companies over the environment and they weren't doing anything wrong.
666	Donald Trump	And that's jobs.
667	Steve Doocy	Right.
668	Steve Doocy	But there are some who say, "Look the EPA is relaxing a lot of rules that are out there to protect people."
669	Donald Trump	Only rules that don't mean anything or rules that are duplicative.
670	Donald Trump	You know, rules where you have...
671	Steve Doocy	There's a lot of those.
672	Donald Trump	Well, not only that, I mean, some of them you have nine different times you have to get the same thing approved by different agencies.
673	Steve Doocy	Right.
674	Donald Trump	To build a highway in this country takes 19 years of approvals.
675	Donald Trump	I have it down to two years.
676	Donald Trump	And you'll get rejected if it's wrong, if it's environmentally bad.
677	Steve Doocy	Right.
678	Donald Trump	But I have it down to two years.
679	Donald Trump	I want to get it down to one year.
680	Donald Trump	And that's indicative of everything else, too.
681	Donald Trump	A company comes in from China, from Japan they want to spend a tremendous amount of money on building a plant or something, right?
682	Donald Trump	It takes them seven years to get a permit, and they don't do it because it's too long.
683	Steve Doocy	Right.
684	Donald Trump	I have it down to one year and even faster.
685	Donald Trump	Now, if they're wrong, we know immediately.
686	Steve Doocy	Right.
687	Donald Trump	You know, you don't have to wait seven years.
688	Donald Trump	How about going through the process seven years and getting rejected?
689	Donald Trump	How about a highway that spends 19 years getting approved and then in the last vote they get a three-to-two vote no?
690	Steve Doocy	Right.
691	Donald Trump	That happens oftentimes and they spend hundreds of millions of dollars on the approval.
692	Donald Trump	Not going to happen anymore.
693	Steve Doocy	I saw a headline on Drudge, I think this morning, unemployment at a 44-year low.
694	Donald Trump	Yeah, yeah.
695	Donald Trump	Drudge is great, by the way.
696	Donald Trump	Matt Drudge is a great gentleman who -- who really -- I don't know, he's got an ability to capture the stories that people want to see.
697	Donald Trump	But that was the number one story on Drudge.
698	Donald Trump	Forty-four year low unemployment, and -- and I saw that in very big letters actually...
699	Steve Doocy	Right.
700	Donald Trump	...and I said "That makes me very proud."
701	Steve Doocy	Another story out there was -- this past week is, while you did meet with Kim Jong-un, it sounds like you and Mr. Putin may be sitting down sometime soon.
702	Steve Doocy	What -- what can you tell us about that?
703	Donald Trump	We may.
704	Donald Trump	And -- and it started because a reporter shouted to me, "Should Putin be in the G-7?"
705	Donald Trump	I said, "No, he should be in the G-8."
706	Donald Trump	It used to be the G-8 a few years ago, and I think President Obama didn't like him or -- even though they gave advance notice about the election to Obama...
707	Steve Doocy	Right.
708	Donald Trump	...people forget about that.
709	Donald Trump	You know, Obama was told by the CIA or somebody, FBI, about Russia.
710	Donald Trump	He didn't do anything about it.
711	Donald Trump	How come he never gets blamed?
712	Steve Doocy	Right.
713	Donald Trump	In September, just before the election, my election, he should have done it, because maybe I would have won by more.
714	Steve Doocy	Right.
715	Steve Doocy	Yesterday, a big day.
716	Steve Doocy	Not only did the A.G. report come out, but it was your birthday.
717	Donald Trump	That's right.
718	Steve Doocy	Get any good presents?
719	Donald Trump	I got a lot of good kisses.
720	Donald Trump	I got a lot of phone calls from people that I would never have gotten phone calls from.
721	Donald Trump	I got phone calls from...
722	Steve Doocy	Who'd you get the kisses from?
723	Donald Trump	From my beautiful wife...
724	Steve Doocy	OK.
725	Donald Trump	...who's really doing great, she's doing great.
726	Donald Trump	But -- and my kids.
727	Steve Doocy	Oh, speaking of your wife...
728	Donald Trump	Yeah?
729	Steve Doocy	...you know, we saw a story -- I think as you were heading to the chopper you said, you know, she can't fly for a month.
730	Donald Trump	One month.
731	Donald Trump	Well, the doctor said, "Don't fly for a month," but she'll be able to very shortly.
732	Steve Doocy	Because she's on the mend?
733	Donald Trump	Oh, she's in great shape.
734	Donald Trump	She's like perfect.
735	Steve Doocy	Right.
736	Donald Trump	She -- somebody said, "Did she have a face lift?"
737	Donald Trump	No.
738	Donald Trump	Did she have this?
739	Donald Trump	Did she have that?
740	Donald Trump	I mean, the speculation, even after the doctors gave a full -- and these are White House doctors.
741	Donald Trump	They give -- you know, they give really straight stuff.
742	Donald Trump	But no, she's doing fantastically well.
743	Steve Doocy	We had your son Don Jr. on our show, and he said he was not getting you anything for your birthday because you've got everything.
744	Donald Trump	Well, I just want to have a successful country.
745	Donald Trump	I'll be honest, I -- this is so intensive.
746	Donald Trump	We've done more -- I don't say this in a bragging way, actually some of the haters actually say this.
747	Donald Trump	We've done more in 500 days -- so now it's 510 days -- than any 500-day president first term by far.
748	Steve Doocy	Yeah.
749	Donald Trump	And that's what I want to do.
750	Donald Trump	I want to really -- you know, I got elected to make America great again.
751	Donald Trump	Very simple: Make America great again.
752	Donald Trump	That's what we're doing.
753	Donald Trump	And we are respected around the world.
754	Donald Trump	You take a look at Iran, they're not talking about Iran taking over the Middle East.
755	Donald Trump	I took that crazy deal that Obama gave them away.
756	Donald Trump	Iran is not looking to the Mediterranean anymore.
757	Donald Trump	You know, they had to go through a lot of territory to get there.
758	Steve Doocy	Right.
759	Donald Trump	They're looking to survive.
760	Donald Trump	But I will tell you, some day soon they're going to come back and they're going to want to negotiate a deal and we'll make a deal.
761	Donald Trump	But they were nasty.
762	Donald Trump	They were very, very nasty, and it had to be stopped.
763	Donald Trump	I took away the deal, and I think they've been treating America with much more respect.
764	Donald Trump	And I have to say that you don't see the little boats circling our boats anymore; do you notice that?
765	Donald Trump	Remember with Obama, you had this beautiful destroyer, you had this Annapolis captain on the boat, and he's sitting there, and you could see he's like a boiler waiting to explode, because he was giving orders.
766	Donald Trump	And they were circling us with those boats, right?
767	Donald Trump	And he wanted to shoot the hell out of them...
768	Steve Doocy	Well, they were harassing -- trying to engage...
769	Donald Trump	He wanted to -- they were harassing our -- our guys.
