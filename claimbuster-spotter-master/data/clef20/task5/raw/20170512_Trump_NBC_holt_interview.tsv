1	Donald Trump	Look, he's a showboat.
2	Donald Trump	He's a grandstander.
3	Donald Trump	The FBI has been in turmoil.
4	Donald Trump	You know that.
5	Donald Trump	I know that.
6	Donald Trump	Everybody knows that.
7	Donald Trump	You take a look at the FBI a year ago, it was in virtual turmoil.
8	Donald Trump	Less than a year ago.
9	Donald Trump	It hasn't recovered from that.
10	Lester Holt	Monday, you met with the Deputy Attorney General Rob Rosenstein.
11	Lester Holt	Did you ask for a recommendation? What I did is, was I going to fire
12	SYSTEM	[James]
13	Lester Holt	Comey.
14	Donald Trump	My decision.
15	Donald Trump	It was not...
16	Lester Holt	You had made the decision before they came over...
17	Donald Trump	I...
18	Donald Trump	I was going to fire Comey.
19	Donald Trump	There is no good time to do it by the way.
20	Donald Trump	They...
21	Lester Holt	Because in your letter you said I...
22	Lester Holt	I accepted...
23	Lester Holt	I accepted their recommendation.
24	Lester Holt	So, you had already made the decision.
25	Donald Trump	Oh, I was going to fire regardless of recommendation. So there
26	SYSTEM	[inaudible]
27	Donald Trump	He made a recommendation He is highly respected.
28	Donald Trump	Very good guy.
29	Donald Trump	Very smart guy.
30	Donald Trump	The Democrats like him.
31	Donald Trump	The Republicans like him.
32	Donald Trump	He made a recommendation, but regardless of recommendation I was going to fire Comey, knowing there was no good time to do it.
33	Donald Trump	And in fact, when I decided to just do it I said to myself, I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.
34	Donald Trump	It's an excuse by the Democrats having lost an election that they should have won.
35	Donald Trump	And the reason they should have won it is, the electoral college is almost impossible for a Republican to win.
36	Donald Trump	Very hard.
37	Donald Trump	Because you start off at such a disadvantage.
38	Donald Trump	So, everybody was thinking they should have won the election.
39	Donald Trump	This was an excuse for having lost an election.
40	Lester Holt	Are you angry with Mr. Comey because of his Russia investigation?
41	Donald Trump	I just want somebody that's competent.
42	Donald Trump	I am a big fan of the FBI.
43	Donald Trump	I love the FBI.
44	Donald Trump	I love the people of the FBI.
45	Donald Trump	but when you have a land of people taking on that investigation I think that.
46	Lester Holt	But were you a fan of him taking up that investigation?
47	Donald Trump	I think that... about the Hillary Clinton investigation?
48	Lester Holt	No, about the Russia investigation and possible links between...
49	Donald Trump	No, I don't care... look, look, let me tell you.
50	Donald Trump	As far as I'm concerned, I want that thing to be absolutely done properly.
51	Donald Trump	When I did this now, I said I probably maybe, will confuse people.
52	Donald Trump	Maybe I'll expand that, you know, I'll lengthen the time because... it should be over with, it should... in my opinion, it should have been over with a long time ago, because all it is, is an excuse, But, I said to myself I might even lengthen out the investigation, but I have to do the right thing for the American people.
53	Donald Trump	He's the wrong man for that position.
54	SYSTEM	[Break]
55	Lester Holt	Let me ask you about your termination letter to Mr. Comey.
56	Lester Holt	You write: I greatly appreciate you informing me on three separate occasions and I am not under investigation.
57	Lester Holt	Why did you put that in there?
58	Donald Trump	Because he told me that.
59	Donald Trump	I mean, he told me...
60	Lester Holt	He told you you weren't under investigation with regard to the Russia investigation?
61	Donald Trump	Yeah, and I've heard that, I've heard that from others.
62	Lester Holt	Was it in a phone call?
63	Lester Holt	Did you meet face to face?
64	Donald Trump	I had a dinner with him.
65	Donald Trump	He wanted to have dinner, because he wanted to stay on.
66	Donald Trump	We had a very nice dinner at the White House very early on.
67	Lester Holt	He asked for that?
68	Donald Trump	That dinner was arranged.
69	Donald Trump	I think he asked for the dinner.
70	Donald Trump	And he wanted to stay on as the FBI head.
71	Donald Trump	And I said, I would, you know, consider will see what happens.
72	Donald Trump	But we had a very nice dinner.
73	Donald Trump	And at that time, he told me you are not under investigation, which I knew anyway.
74	Lester Holt	That was one meeting.
75	Lester Holt	What were the other two?
76	Donald Trump	First of all, when you are under investigation, you're giving all sorts of documents and everything.
77	Donald Trump	I knew I wasn't under... And I heard it was stated at the committee, at some committee level that I wasn't.
78	Donald Trump	Number one.
79	Lester Holt	So that didn't come directly from him.
80	Donald Trump	Then during the phone call, he said it, and then doing another phone call he said it.
81	Donald Trump	So, he said it once at dinner, and then he said it twice doing phone calls.
82	Lester Holt	Did... did you call him?
83	Donald Trump	In one case, I called him.
84	Donald Trump	In one case, he called me.
85	Lester Holt	And did you ask am I under under investigation?
86	Donald Trump	I actually asked him, yes.
87	Donald Trump	I said, if it's possible, would you let me know if I am under investigation?
88	Donald Trump	He said you are not under investigation.
89	Lester Holt	But he's... he's given sworn testimony that there is an ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign, and possible collusion with the Russian government.
90	Lester Holt	You were the centerpiece of the Trump campaign.
91	Lester Holt	Is he being truthful when he says you're not under investigation?
92	Donald Trump	Well, all I can tell you is... all, well, I know..
93	Donald Trump	I know that I'm not under investigation, me personally.
94	Donald Trump	I'm not talking about campaigns.
95	Donald Trump	I'm not talking about anything else.
96	Donald Trump	I'm not under investigation
97	Lester Holt	Did you ask him to drop the investigation?
98	Donald Trump	No, never.
99	Lester Holt	Did anyone from the White House...
100	Donald Trump	No, in fact I want the investigation speeded up.
101	Lester Holt	Did anyone from the White House ask him to end the investigation?
102	Donald Trump	No, no, why would we do that?
103	Lester Holt	Any surrogates on behalf of the White House?
104	Donald Trump	Not that I know of.
105	Donald Trump	Look, I want to find out if there was a problem with an election having to do with Russia, or by the way any, but... anybody else.
106	Donald Trump	Any other country.
107	Donald Trump	And, I want that to be so strong and so good.
108	Donald Trump	And, I want it to happen.
109	Donald Trump	I also want to have a really competent, capable director.
110	Donald Trump	He's not.
111	Donald Trump	He's a showboater.
112	Donald Trump	He's not my man, or not my man, and I didn't appoint him.
113	Donald Trump	He was appointed long before me.
114	Donald Trump	But I want somebody who's going to do a great job, and I will tell you, we're looking at candidates right now who could be spectacular and that's what I want for the FBI.
115	Lester Holt	What you said a moment ago about supporting the idea of investigation a lot of people would find it hard to believe that the man who just said that tweeted very recently it's a total hoax.
116	Lester Holt	It's a taxpayer charade.
117	Donald Trump	Oh, I think that looking into me and, the campaign...look, I have nothing to do.
118	Donald Trump	This was set up by the Democrats.
119	Donald Trump	There is no collusion between me and my campaign and the Russians.
120	Donald Trump	The other thing is the Russians did not affect the vote.
121	Donald Trump	And everybody seems to think that.
122	Lester Holt	There is an investigation under way though, an FBI investigation.
123	Lester Holt	Is that a charade?
124	Donald Trump	Well, I don't know if it's an FBI, or if it's, there's so many investigations.
125	Donald Trump	I don't know if it's an FBI investigation or if it's a Congress, if it's the Senate, or the House...
126	Lester Holt	Well, James Comey testified there was an an FBI investigation.
127	Donald Trump	Yeah, but I think they're also helping the House and the Senate.
128	Donald Trump	So, you probably have FB.. FBI, but you have House, you have Senate.
129	Donald Trump	They have other investigations.
130	Lester Holt	But when you put out tweets it's a total hoax, it's a taxpayer charade, and you're looking for a new FBI director, are you not sending that person a message to lay off?
131	Donald Trump	No.
132	Donald Trump	I'm not doing that.
133	Donald Trump	I think that we have to get back to work, but I want to find out...
134	Donald Trump	I want to get to the bottom.
135	Donald Trump	If Russia hacked, if Russia did anything having to do with our election,
136	Lester Holt	Well, there's already, already intelligence from virtually every intelligence agency that yes, that happened.
137	Donald Trump	I'll tell you this.
138	Donald Trump	If Russia or anybody else is trying to interfere with our elections, I think it's a horrible thing, and I want to get to the bottom of it, and I want to make sure it will never ever happen.
139	Lester Holt	Were angry with James Comey when he went public and said he can't support your unsubstantiated charges of wire tapping... that your your predecessor wiretapped you?
140	Donald Trump	I was surprised he said it but I wasn't angry.
141	Donald Trump	There's a big thing going on right now which is spying, and it's.... you can call it anything you want.
142	Donald Trump	The, the unmasking, and the spying, and to me, that's the big story right now.
143	Donald Trump	That's a very very big story.
144	Lester Holt	You didn't take that as a sign of disloyalty that came out and contradicted you?
145	Donald Trump	No, I didn't...
146	Donald Trump	I didn't.
147	Donald Trump	I don't think of it is loyalty.
148	Donald Trump	I mean, I want, whoever the director is, I want them to do the right thing.
149	Lester Holt	And what about when he went public and said that there was in fact an FBI investigation looking at your campaign and Russia.
150	Lester Holt	Did that anger you?
151	Lester Holt	I ask that because there's... there is a sense that there was a building anger here.
152	Donald Trump	Well, you know, I have that.
153	Donald Trump	I have that.
154	Donald Trump	No, no, no.
155	Donald Trump	I..
156	Donald Trump	I know, every once in a while you'll see that in the newspaper, anger, somebody will report, or they'll have fall sources that maybe don't exist, because of the media, the way the media is.
157	Donald Trump	No, I will tell you I think that, um, I want, very simply a great FBI director.
158	Lester Holt	And we expect that they would would continue on with this investigation?
159	Donald Trump	Oh yeah sure, I expect that.
160	Lester Holt	General Flynn is a part of his investigation.
161	Lester Holt	You know, Sally Yates recently testified that the White House was notified that he had been compromised, he was at risk of being blackmailed.
162	Lester Holt	It was eighteen days later that he was finally fired.
163	Lester Holt	During that eighteen days he had access, I assume, to all the nation's top secrets.
164	Lester Holt	One day, you meet on the issue of Comey...
165	Donald Trump	Right.
166	Lester Holt	...and you fire in a humiliating way while he's sitting in a room with his colleagues and it's appearing on the TV.
167	Donald Trump	Cause my White House Counsel Don McGahn, came back to me, and did not sound like an emergency of any... it didn't make it sound like he was, you know... and she actually didn't make it sound that way either, in the hearings the other day, like it had to be done immediately.
168	Donald Trump	This man has served for many years.
169	Donald Trump	He's a general.
170	Donald Trump	He's a, in my opinion, a very good person.
171	Donald Trump	I believe that it would be very unfair to hear from somebody who we don't even know and immediately run out and fire a general.
172	Donald Trump	Now...
173	Lester Holt	She was the acting Attorney General at the time.
174	Donald Trump	Uh, my White House counsel came to me.
175	Donald Trump	They had, I believe two meetings.
176	Donald Trump	And we ultimately fired, but was fired for a different reason.
177	Lester Holt	You're talking about General Flynn.
178	Donald Trump	General Flynn, yes.
179	Lester Holt	Because of, because of lying to the Vice President.
180	Donald Trump	Yeah, but everything plays in.
181	Donald Trump	Everything plays into it.
182	Donald Trump	But we fired him because he said something to the vice president that was not so.
183	Lester Holt	Did you know that he had had that received payments from the Russian government, that he had received payments from the Turkish government?
184	Donald Trump	No, no but Obama perhaps knew because he had clearance from the Obama administration.
185	Donald Trump	And his clearance... and, and this is something they never want to report.
186	Donald Trump	He had clearance from the Obama administration, the highest clearance you can have.
187	Donald Trump	And, I think it's a very unfair thing that the media doesn't talk about that.
188	Donald Trump	You know you're talking about 2015.
189	Donald Trump	I don't know that I knew him in 2015.
190	Lester Holt	The Senate intelligence committee wants, wants info... information from the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Unit about your finances, your business' finances.
191	Donald Trump	Yeah.
192	Lester Holt	Can you tell us whether you, your family, your business is... your surrogates have accepted any investments, any loans from Russian individual or institutions?
193	Donald Trump	Yeah, in fact I just sent a letter sent to Lindsey Graham from one of the most prestigious law firms.
194	Donald Trump	in the country, a tremendous, highly-rated law firm that I have nothing to do with Russia.
195	Donald Trump	I have no investments in Russia.
196	Donald Trump	None whatsoever.
197	Donald Trump	I don't have property in Russia.
198	Donald Trump	A lot of people thought I owned office buildings in Moscow.
199	Donald Trump	I don't have property in Russia.
200	Donald Trump	And I am in very...
201	Donald Trump	I'm, I mean...
202	Donald Trump	I'm in total compliance in every way.
203	Donald Trump	Now I have to tell you, I file documents, hundreds of pages worth of documents, with the Federal Elections Bureau.
204	Donald Trump	Everybody's seen that.
205	Donald Trump	I built a great company.
206	Donald Trump	But I'm not involved with Russia.
207	Donald Trump	I have had dealings over the years where I sold a house to a very wealthy Russian, many years ago.
208	Donald Trump	I had the Miss Universe pageant, which I owned for quite a while, I had it in Moscow, long time ago.
209	Donald Trump	But other than that, I have nothing to do with Russia.
210	Lester Holt	And one last a question on this matter, did you ever...
211	Donald Trump	And I have a certified letter, just so you understand.
212	Donald Trump	It...
213	Donald Trump	I'm not just saying that.
214	Donald Trump	I've given the letter.
215	Donald Trump	I've given a letter to Senator Lindsey Graham.
216	Donald Trump	He has the letter, and I think frankly...
217	Donald Trump	I assume he's going to give the letter out.
218	Donald Trump	But it says, I am not involved in Russia.
219	Donald Trump	No loans.
220	Donald Trump	No nothing.
221	Lester Holt	Did you worry at all when you made the decision to fire Comey when you did, the day before Lavrov was here in the White House, and the Russian ambassador.
222	Lester Holt	Did you think through the optics of the way this would look?
223	Donald Trump	I never thought about.
224	Donald Trump	It was set up a while ago.
225	Donald Trump	And frankly I could have waited but, what difference does it make?
226	Donald Trump	I'm not looking for cosmetics.
227	Donald Trump	I'm looking to do a great job for the country.
228	Donald Trump	I'm looking to create jobs.
229	Donald Trump	I'm looking to create strength and security.
230	Donald Trump	I'm looking to have strong borders.
231	Donald Trump	I'm looking for things like that.
232	Donald Trump	I think it's really a good thing that I meet with people.
233	Donald Trump	Now, this is a public meeting, because you know, when you cover this, the people watching may say, oh he met with Lavrov.
234	Donald Trump	Well, this was announced that I'm meeting with Lavrov, just like the number of days ago I spoke... had a very good conversation, very public in the sense that everybody knew this was taking place.
235	Donald Trump	I meet, I...
236	Donald Trump	I talk all the time.
237	Donald Trump	I just spoke, with the head of, the new head of South Korea, who just got elected.
238	Donald Trump	I speak with the head of India.
239	Donald Trump	I speak with the head of China.
240	Donald Trump	I have to speak with Putin also.
241	Donald Trump	It's called Russia.
242	Donald Trump	But when I spoke with Putin, he asked me whether or not I would see Lavrov.
243	Donald Trump	Now what, should show I say, no I'm not going to see him?
244	Donald Trump	I said I will see him.
245	Donald Trump	During that discussion with Lavrov, I think we had a great discussion having to do with Syria, having to do with the Ukraine, and maybe that discussion will lead to a lot less people getting killed, and will lead ultimately to peace, so I'm...
246	Donald Trump	I'm okay with those discussions Lester, I think it's a good thing, not a bad thing.
