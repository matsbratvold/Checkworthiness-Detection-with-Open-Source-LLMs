Oh, we had such luck in Orlando, we love being in Orlando.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, Orlando.	0
What a turnout!	0
What a turnout!	0
You know this is a very big arena for a Tuesday night.	0
"I said, you know, if we have about three or four empty seats, the fake news will say, Headlines: ""He didn't fill up the arena"", so I said, maybe we shouldn't take a chance."	0
"Maybe we shouldn't go to Orlando as you go someplace else, then I said, ""No, I think, we'll go to Orlando."""	0
And -- and not only did we fill it up, but we had 120,000 requests.	0
That means you folks have come out very, very good.	0
Congratulations.	0
I want to thank our great Vice President Mike Pence and his wonderful wife, Karen Pence, and our magnificent First Lady Melania, thank you.	0
I am thrilled to be back in my second home.	0
That's what it is.	0
It's my second home.	0
In many cases, I think I could say it's my first home, if you want to know the truth.	0
It's the great state of Florida, very historic, because exactly four years ago this week, I announced my campaign for president of the United States and it turned out to be more than just a political campaign.	0
It turned out to be a great political movement because of you.	0
A great movement.	0
A movement made up of hard working patriots who love their country, love their flag, love their children, and who believe that a nation must care for its own citizens first.	0
Together, we stared down a corrupt and broken political establishment and we restored government of, by, and for the people.	0
Our country is now thriving, prospering and booming.	0
And frankly, it's soaring to incredible new heights.	0
Our economy is the envy of the world, perhaps the greatest economy we've had in the history of our country.	0
And as long as you keep this team in place, we have a tremendous way to go.	0
Our future has never ever looked brighter or sharper.	0
The fact is, the American Dream is back, it's bigger and better, and stronger than ever, before.	0
2016 was not merely another four-year election.	0
This was a defining moment in American history.	0
Ask them right there.	0
By the way, that is a lot of fake news back there, that's a lot.	0
You know what I say, the amount of press we have tonight reminds me of the Academy Awards before it went political and their ratings went down the tubes.	0
This was our chance to reclaim our government from a permanent political class that enriched itself at your expense.	0
As I said, what a wonderful beautiful day at my inauguration, we did not merely transfer power from one party to another, but we transferred power back to you, the proud citizens of the United States of America.	0
We stared down the unholy alliance of lobbyists and donors and special interests, who made a living, bleeding our country dry.	0
That's what we've done.	0
We broke down the doors of Washington backrooms, where deals were cut to close our companies, give away your jobs, shut down our factories, and surrender your sovereignty and your very way of life, and we've ended it.	0
We took on a political machine that tried to take away your voice and your vote.	0
They tried to take away your dignity and your destiny, but we will never let them do that, will we?	0
"Many times I said, ""We would drain the swamp."","	0
and that's exactly what we're doing right now, we're draining the swamp.	0
And that's why the swamp is fighting back so viciously and violently.	0
For the last two and a half years, we have been under siege, and with the Mueller report we won, and now they want a do over, they want a do over.	0
Let's do it again, didn't work out too well, let's do it again.	0
They want a do over.	0
No president should ever have to go through this again.	0
It is so bad for our great country.	0
Our hopes, the great hopes.	0
Our patriotic movement has been under assault from the very first day.	0
We accomplish more than any other president has in the first two and a half years of a presidency and under circumstances that no president has had to deal with before, because we did in the middle of the great and illegal witch hunt, things that nobody have been able to accomplish, not even close.	0
Nobody's done what we have done in two and a half years.	0
We went through the greatest witch hunt in political history.	0
The only collusion was committed by the Democrats, the fake news media and their operatives and the people who funded the phony dossier, crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC.	0
It was all an illegal attempt to overturn the results of the election spy on our campaign, which is what they did and subvert our democracy.	0
Remember, the insurance policy, just in case Hillary Clinton lost.	0
Remember the insurance policy?	0
They appointed 18 very angry Democrats to try to take down our incredible movement.	0
After two years, 1.4 million pages of documents, 500 search warrants, 500 witnesses, 2,800 subpoenas, and 40 FBI agents working round the clock.	0
What did they come up with?	0
No collusion.	0
And the facts that led our great attorney general to determine no obstruction.	0
No collusion, no obstruction.	0
And they spent $40 million on this witch hunt, $40 million.	0
That's right, they spent $40 million, probably a hell of a lot more than that.	0
And think about it, nobody's been tougher on Russia than Donald Trump.	0
Nobody.	0
We call it The Russian hoax.	0
"Remember, President Obama's famous line caught on the open mic, secretly telling the Russian president to quote, ""Inform Vladimir that after my election I'll have more flexibility."""	0
Okay.	0
Remember that?	0
Remember that?	0
Lot of people remember that, I remembered it.	0
I saw it happen, I didn't like it.	0
They don't bring it up.	0
The fake news will never bring it up.	0
And in September, just before the election, the FBI told President Obama about possible Russian interference and he did nothing because he thought that Hillary Clinton, Crooked Hillary was going to win, that's why he did nothing.	0
He did nothing.	0
I built up the military, imposed sanctions on Russia, and provided alternative energy sources for all over Europe that competed very, very strongly with Russia.	0
We are, by the way, the No.1 producer of energy in the world because of what we've done right now, The Democrats don't care about Russia, they only care about their own political power.	0
They went after my family, my business, my finances, my employees, almost everyone that I've ever known or worked with, but they are really going after you.	0
That's what it's all about, not about us, it's about you.	0
They tried to erase your vote, erase your legacy of the greatest campaign and the greatest election, probably in the history of our country, and they wanted to deny you the future that you demanded and the future that America deserves, and that now America is getting.	0
Our Radical Democrat opponents are driven by hatred, prejudice, and rage.	0
They want to destroy you and they want to destroy our country, as we know it.	0
Not acceptable, it's not going to happen.	0
It's not going to happen.	0
To understand Democrats ruthless tactics, look no further than the United States Supreme Court and our court system nationwide.	0
I will soon have appointed my 145th judge.	0
President Obama was very nice to us.	0
He didn't fill the positions.	0
I get there the first day.	0
How many judges do I have to appoint?,	0
"they said, ""Sir, 139."","	0
now it's 145 and we've just finished number 107, already approved sitting on the bench, how about that?	0
And by the time we're finished with the rest, we will have a record percentages.	0
Our percentage will be a record except for one person.	0
One person has a higher percentage than your favorite President Donald Trump.	0
You know who that president is?	0
He's got a higher percentage than me and it's devastating.	0
His name is George Washington.	0
George is at 100% and there's no way I'm going to get there no matter what I tell you.	0
Got 100%.	0
Well, he was first, so he just appointed them all and that was it.	0
That's going to be a hard record to beat.	0
They want to take away your judges.	0
They want to pack the court with far left ideologues and they want to radicalise our judiciary.	0
You know that, we already have a lot of that.	0
Look at what they did to a great gentleman, Justice Kavanagh, highly respected.	0
They didn't just try to win.	0
They tried to destroy him with false and malicious accusations.	0
And thank you, Marco, and thank you Lindsey wherever you may be.	0
Thank you, great job, thank you.	0
Stand up.	0
Yeah, Lindsey Graham was doing okay in South Carolina, aint that great?	0
Now he's through the roof great.	0
Thank you.	0
Great job, thank you.	0
Great people, great people, all of them.	0
They tried to ruin the family of now, Justice Kavanagh.	0
They tried to ruin his career, they tried to ruin his life.	0
They even wanted to impeach him on fraudulent charges.	0
Those charges were a fraud.	0
He did nothing wrong.	0
All in pursuit of political domination and control.	0
Just imagine what this angry left-wing mob would do if they were in charge of this country.	0
Imagine if we had a Democrat president and a Democrat congress in 2020.	0
They would shut down your free speech, use the power of the law to punish their opponents, which they're trying to do now anyway, they'll always be trying to shield themselves.	0
They would strip Americans of their constitutional rights while flooding the country with illegal immigrants in the hopes it will expand their political base, and they'll get votes someplace down the future.	0
That's what it's about.	0
And we are building the wall.	0
We're going to have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year.	0
It's moving rapidly, moving very rapidly.	0
And you know we couldn't get the wall approved by the Democrats, even though they voted for it four years ago and six years ago and didn't get built, but they voted for it, all of a sudden, Trump is president, we don't want a wall.	0
Can you imagine, can you imagine those caravans without having the barriers and walls that we've already put up and that are up.	0
This country would be a mess like you wouldn't believe.	0
So the wall is moving along, it's moving along rapidly.	0
It's beautiful, I changed the design, it's stronger, bigger, better, and cheaper.	0
Cheaper, a lot cheaper.	0
You know sometimes when they don't give you the money, you have to make it cheaper, not going to happen, but it's going well.	0
Instead of bringing us together as one America, Democrats want to splinter us into factions and tribes, they want us divided, not going to happen to the Republicans anymore, it's not going to happen.	0
This election is not merely a verdict on the amazing progress we've made.	0
It's a verdict on the un-American conduct of those who tried to undermine our great democracy, and undermine you.	0
And by the way, on July 4th, in Washington, D.C., come on down, we're going have a big day.	0
Bring your flags, bring those flags.	0
Bring those American flags, July 4th, we're going to have hundreds of thousands of people, we're going to celebrate America.	0
Sounds good, right?	0
July 4th, celebrate America.	0
This election is a verdict on whether we want to live in a country where the people who lose an election refuse to concede and spend the next two years trying to shred our Constitution and rip your country apart.	0
"You remember during one of the debates, when Crooked Hillary said, ""If I win, are you going to support me?"","	0
but I must be honest, I didn't give her a great answer.	0
That was a very -- I might have been my hardest question during the debates.	0
Isn't it amazing that it worked the other way around, right?	0
Is isn't it amazing?	0
If you want to know how the system is rigged, just compare how they came after us for three years with everything they had, versus the free pass they gave to Hillary and her aides after they set up an illegal server, destroyed evidence deleted and acid washed 33,000 e-mails, exposed classified information, and turned the State Department into a pay-for-play cash machine.	0
33,000 emails deleted, think of it.	0
I keep mentioning, you know, there was a lot of corruption on the other side, but you know the simplest thing, they get a subpoena from the United States Congress and they decide that they're not going to give it so Lindsey Graham, they did delete and they acid wash, which is very expensive.	0
Nobody does it, they acid wash those emails, never to be seen again, but we may find them somewhere deep in the State Department.	0
But can you imagine, if I got a subpoena, think of this, If I got a subpoena for e-mails, if I deleted one e-mail, like a love note to Melania, it's the electric chair for Trump, 33,000 e-mails.	0
But let's see what happens, we now have a great attorney general, let's see what happens.	0
So if you either shut down this rigged system once and for all, then show up November 3rd, that's your day, big day, and vote, vote, vote, we're going to have a big, big day.	0
Thank you.	0
And remember the only thing these corrupt politicians will understand is an earthquake at the ballot box, that's what they will understand, and they're going to see it.	0
We did it once and now we will do it again, and this time we're going to finish the job, and this time should be a lot easier because we have done so much with our military, with our vets, with the Second Amendment, with our regulations, with the biggest tax cut in history, with getting rid of so many different problems, so many different things, including, by the way, the individual mandate in Obamacare, one of the worst things anybody's ever had to live through.	1
We got rid of the individual mandate.	0
Right?	0
How many people are happy?	0
They no longer have to pay for the privilege of not paying for bad health insurance.	0
How many people are happy?	0
Bad health care.	0
So every time you don't have to make out a check in order not to have health care.	0
Think of that, think of that.	0
This is the only country you pay for the very distinct privilege of not having to pay but you have to pay a lot.	0
Now you don't have to pay anymore.	0
You don't want it, you don't have to pay.	0
The individual mandate, Mike.	0
We got rid of it.	0
That was a big deal.	0
The people tried to stop our movement are the same Washington insiders, who spent their careers rigging the system, so your losses will be their gains, you know that.	0
These are the same career politicians who presided over decades of flat wages, the loss of our manufacturing jobs.	0
Sixty thousand, could you believe that?	0
Sixty thousand, who would believe that number?	0
And you know how I know it's true, because if it wasn't I've been using it a lot.	0
The fake news would have headlines: Trump used a phony number., they'll have headline.	0
It would be the biggest story: Trump used -- well, they never corrected it, so I assumed, fellas, 60,000 shuttered factories.	0
We closed up 60,000 factories, it didn't seem right.	0
It didn't seem like it would be possible.	0
And avalanche of job killing regulations, a growing wealth gap and one ruinous trade deal after another.	0
By the way, those trade deals are getting very good folks, you will see.	0
We just completed the deal with South Korea.	0
Great deal.	0
We're working with Mexico and Canada.	0
We have to get the Democrats to approve it.	0
We wanted to be bipartisan.	0
As you know, you may have read a couple of things about China.	0
I spoke to President Xi.	0
Terrific president, a great leader of China, spoke to him this morning at length and we'll see what happens, but we are going to have a good deal and a fair deal or we're not going to have a deal at all and that's okay too.	0
Because we are taking in billions and billions of dollars into our treasury and companies are leaving China because they want to avoid paying these large tariffs.	0
And by the way, when the fake news tells you that you are paying, in the case of China, they devalue their currency, that helps them.	0
And you know what else they're doing?	0
They're subsidizing those companies and you're not paying very much if you're paying anything at all, the case of China, and we are taking billions and billions of dollars in.	0
And remember this, and you know it as well as I do, we have never taken in 10 cents from China, we would lose $500 billion a year with China.	0
We rebuilt China.	0
They've done a great job, but they took us for suckers, and that includes Obama and Biden.	0
We took -- they took us for suckers.	0
Five hundred billion, five hundred billion.	0
"Somebody said, ""You mean five hundred million."""	0
That's a lot too, right?	0
No, $500 billion, actually more than that, I don't want to be too specific 507.	0
We're fighting against the same far left politicians that ravage our great cities and crush the dreams of African-American middle class, the same people who threw open our borders and allowed drugs, gangs, and illegal labor to devastate our poorest American communities, you know that.	0
Our political opponents looked down with hatred on our values and with utter disdain for the people whose lives they want to run.	0
That's the way they've been doing it and if you take a look at the African American community, how's -- how much progress has been made, the lowest unemployment numbers in the history of our country.	0
They called you and us, do you remember this?	0
They called us deplorables, that was a mistake.	0
That was a big mistake.	0
I'll never forget.	0
I was making a speech after Hillary used the word deplorables, and I didn't think it was that bad, you know why?	0
She used another word.	0
You know what the other word was?	0
She said, deplorables and irredeemables.	0
I think that was worse, but it didn't get picked up.	0
You never know what's going to get picked up.	0
It didn't.	0
I think irredeemables is worst than deplorables, but I'll never forget.	0
I was making a speech the next day.	0
We had a big crowd in a great, great state, and women, in particular, were wearing: We are deplorables, The deplorables love you.	0
"And there were hundreds and hundreds of people wearing: We are deplorables, and I said, ""I think Hillary Clinton made a big mistake with that speech, and that is the problem with politics, one word and your career is ruined."	0
You never know, you have to be very careful with the fakers back there.	0
I have news for democrats who want to return us to the bitter failures and betrayals of the past.	0
We are not going back we're going on to victory, going on to victory.	0
[Inaudible]	0
"take it away as fast as it came, and as Mike Pence said a little while ago, ""That's why we want a little more time."	0
"It's going to be cemented, it's going to be cemented."""	0
You know we have a big decision to make.	0
"You know what I'm going to say, ""We have to come up with a theme for the new campaign, right?"	0
Is it going to be Make America Great Again, which is probably and possibly the greatest theme in the history of politics, I think.	0
Make America Great Again, MAGA country, right?	0
MAGA, MAGA, MAGA, we're in MAGA country, that I can tell you.	0
But you know today we had a massive day on the stock market.	0
A lot of good things are happening, but we had a very big day and we're very close to, I think, are 68 record.	0
You know we've hit all time records.	0
This tremendous, I think it's actually more than that, but it's a lot.	0
So now I say, we've made America great again, but how do you give up the No.	0
1 call a theme, logo, statement in the history of politics for a new one, but you know there's a new one that really works and that's called Keep America Great, right?	0
Keep America Great, right?	0
Keep America Great.	0
In other words make America Great Again, well, we've really done it.	0
We've rebuilt our military, it's still in the process.	0
We've taken care of our vets.	0
We've cut the hell out of regulations.	0
You know, have cut more regulations than any president in the history of our country, regardless of the length of their term.	0
So now I say, we need-- we have a lot of brilliant talent campaign people, they cost a fortune and they never give me any ideas.	0
I'm only kidding.	0
So now, I'm saying, what do we use as our theme as our statement, so I'm going to ask you to vote on it.	0
I'm going to go, Make America Great Again and Keep America Great.	0
Let me just here by your cheers, what you like.	0
So, in all fairness, Make America Great, the greatest of all time.	0
I really believe that.	0
The greatest of all time, how do you give up the greatest of all time with a new theme, because you know what's gonna happen?	0
If I do it with a new theme, I give up the greatest of all time and if I lose, people are going to say what a mistake that was, but we're not going to lose so it's not going to matter.	0
We're not going to lose, right?	0
We're not going to lose.	0
Are you ready?	0
First, we do make America Great Again, then we do Keep America Great.	0
Let me hear it.	0
Ready?	0
Make America Great Again.	0
Not bad.	0
I would have said that three years ago, wouldn't be a contest, right?	0
You're ready?	0
Keep America Great.	0
Wow, I'm sorry MAGA country, but that wasn't too close.	0
I thought you had it won, and then I heard this cheer.	0
My eardrums will never be the same.	0
Keep America Great.	0
We're going to keep on fighting for every man and woman and child all across this land.	0
With every ounce of heart and mind, and sweat and soul, we're going to keep making America great again, and then we will indeed Keep America Great.	0
I will keep it so great.	0
Better than ever before.	0
We're going to keep it better than ever before.	0
And that is why tonight, I stand before you to officially launch my campaign for a second term as president of the United States.	0
Thank you.	0
I can promise you that I will never ever let you down.	0
I won't.	0
And I am profoundly thankful to my family.	0
I have a great family Melania, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, Barron, Lara, Jared, Robert, Maryanne, Elizabeth, and my late brother, Fred Jr., we're joined tonight by many great patriots who fight right by our side.	0
Florida's terrific governor.	0
Thank you, Ron.	0
Our first lady, Casey DeSantis.	0
What a job you are doing.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, Ron, Casey.	0
Thank you.	0
What a job.	0
And again, your great lieutenant governor, who I hear is fantastic, right?	0
Jeanette Núñez.	0
Jeannette.	0
Thank you, Jeanette.	0
Beautiful job.	0
Your Florida CFO, Jimmy Patronis.	0
Some really brilliant, tough, wonderful friends who have helped me so much, Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Marco Rubio of Florida, and Rick Scott of Florida.	0
These are great people, they're tough, they're smart, and they love our country.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Rick, Marco, Lindsey, thank you.	0
Members of Congress, warriors also.	0
Boy, they're up there, you want them protecting you, I'll tell you.	0
They don't stop.	0
Matt Gaetz, Ted Yoho, and Michael Waltz.	0
And also, all of our friends and our supporters, you've been incredible.	0
This has been a tremendous night.	0
You've really been incredible.	0
Since the very first day I walked through the doors of the White House.	0
I have never forgotten who sent me there, You did, you did, you did, you did, you did, you did, you all did.	0
When I get behind my desk in the beautiful oval office, I think about only one thing: how the American people are going to win, win, win today.	0
And I'm fighting for you, and I think you see that, not easy, but I love it and the reason I love it because there have been few presidents that have been able to do what we've been able to do for you, and it is a great great feeling, thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
I love it.	0
Together, we're breaking the most sacred rule in Washington politics.	0
We are keeping our promises to the American people, because my only special interest is you.	0
I don't have a special interest, I don't care, I don't care.	0
And by the way, by the way, a woman who has been so good, so talented, so wonderful and we're sort of going to be losing.	0
I have a feeling she's going to be running for a certain gubernatorial position.	0
Don't worry about it, Ron, it's not going to be his last.	0
It won't be in Florida.	0
I promise you, Casey.	0
She'll be tough, right?	0
But a woman who's, a special woman and right -- and her father, by the way, he's out there fighting for us all the time, Sarah Huckabee Sanders.	0
Thank you, Mr. President.	0
This has been truly the honor of a lifetime.	0
One of the most incredible experiences anybody could ever imagine and that's because I've had the chance to be on the front row of history and watch you drastically change our country for the better.	0
You've made America great, you're gonna continue to make America great.	0
I couldn't be prouder to be part of your team.	0
I'm gonna go spend a lot of time with my kids, but no one will be a stronger voice and a more fierce advocate for this president, because he's fighting for all of the people in this room and for all of the people that you represent all over the country and he's gonna have an incredible six more years to make our country as strong as it's ever been.	0
Thank you so much, Mr. President.	0
We're going to miss her.	0
We're going to miss her.	0
Thank you, Sarah.	0
Incredible, a warrior.	0
Since the election, we have created six million new jobs.	0
Nobody thought that would be possible.	0
They said it wouldn't be possible.	0
We have lifted more than six million Americans off of food stamps and we're getting off of welfare and back into the workforce and they're so happy.	0
They are so happy.	0
The unemployment rate is the lowest rate it's been in over 51 years, think of that.	0
And as I said before about African-American, I now say also about Hispanic.-American and Asian-American unemployment have reached the lowest rates in the history of our country.	0
Unemployment.	0
And African-American poverty has also reached, by far, the lowest rate in history.	0
These are incredible numbers.	0
And today, right now, as we speak, almost 160 million people are working, that's more than ever before, it's the first time ever, the number of people is almost 160 million and we're going to be breaking that number soon.	0
Women filled 60% of the new jobs created last year and women's unemployment is now the lowest it's been in 74 years.	0
Wages are rising at the fastest rate in many decades, and really what's nice is they're rising the fastest for the lowest income Americans.	0
Isn't that nice?	0
Percentage wise, the Fed and our pledge to the American worker through Ivanka Trump, she has worked so hard, she's worked hard, has secured commitments to provide private-sector training opportunities to nearly 10 million Americans.	0
It's been an incredible story.	0
It's been an incredible story.	0
Great job.	0
To get relief to working families, we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history, the largest.	0
We doubled, the child-tax credit, and the typical family of four earning $75,000 has seen a tax cut of over $2,000 a year, and that money goes right back into our economy.	0
Our record-breaking regulatory reduction campaign has saved every American household an average of $3,000 per year, and we've ended the last administration's cruel and heartless law on American energy.	0
What they were doing to our energy should never be forgotten.	0
The United States is now the No.1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.	0
And something I want to make clear to the media, we have among the cleanest and sharpest, crystal-clean, you've heard me say it, I went crystal-clean air and water anywhere on Earth.	1
We are creating a future of American energy independence and yet our air and water are the cleanest they've ever been by far, and importantly, we are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.	0
When I came into office, we inherited one of the worst trade deals ever negotiated, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.	0
Would it put you all out of work?	0
TPP would have dealt the death blow to the US auto industry, which, by the way is doing great.	0
Many, many plants are now under construction in Michigan and Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, they hadn't built one in decades and now they're all over the place.	0
In my first week, I withdrew the United States from the job-killing catastrophe that we know what that is: TPP and the Paris environmental accord, not too good, not too good.	0
I thought I was going to take a lot of heat on that, I took none.	0
Would have cost us trillions and trillions of dollars.	0
And we're replacing the NAFTA disaster with the brand new USMCA.	0
And USMCA, that's Mexico and Canada, will create at least 75,000 new jobs for American auto workers and give a massive boost to our farmers and ranchers, and growers all across the Sunshine State and will hopefully soon have bipartisan support.	0
Because everybody wants it to happen.	0
It replaces one of the worst trade deals ever made, NAFTA.	0
NAFTA was a beauty.	0
It was really good if you want to see everybody leave our country.	0
Thanks to our tariffs, american steel mills are roaring back to life, you know that.	0
And we've taken historic action to confront china's chronic trading abuses.	0
It should have been done a long time ago, but the days of stealing American jobs and American companies, American ideas and wealth, those days are over.	0
In the eight years before I took office, on average, we lost two thousand manufacturing jobs a month.	0
Since my inauguration, we've added 16,000 manufacturing jobs a month.	0
That didn't happen by accident.	0
Remember the statement from the previous administration you'd need a magic wand to bring back manufacturing.	0
Well, we'll tell sleepy Joe that we found the magic wand.	0
The sleepy guy.	0
And to remedy past injustices, we passed groundbreaking criminal justice reform.	0
We ended the Clinton era crime policies that unfairly affected the African-American community, so unfair.	0
We are boldly confronting the opioid and drug addiction, and you know what's happening, drug addiction is the scorch of our country and many other countries, and we have made so much progress, so much progress.	0
Opioid down 17, 18, 19, and 21% in some places.	0
And I want to thank our first lady for having worked so hard on that, thank you, thank you.	0
And we're expanding, affordable health care, creating plans 60% cheaper than Obamacare, and we passed, something I'm very proud of, they've wanted to pass it for 45 years.	0
All of the gentlemen that are sitting here from Congress, your congressmen, your senators, they helped us.	0
It's called Right To Try.	0
We have the greatest medical labs in the world.	0
We have incredible things under advisement, and our people, if they were very sick, they were terminally ill.	0
They couldn't get anything because people said no, it might hurt them, they're terminally ill.	0
So I said that doesn't make sense, and these people, if they were rich or had money they'd go to Asia, they'd go to Europe, they'd go all over the world looking for a cure, because the FDA would not approve what we call Right To Try, what a beautiful name, Right To Try, and I got it approved after 44 years, I got it approved.	0
And I saw a beautiful young woman the other day on television, Miss Harp, incredible woman.	0
Did anyone see her?	0
She was incredible, and she was so thankful that she's doing so well and they were giving her instructions on what you do when you're dying, and then all of a sudden this happened, and now it looks like she's going to be around for a long time, and there are many, many cases right there.	0
Right To Try.	0
And I hope nobody in this room ever needs it, but we now have it.	0
For the first time in half a century, we've reduced the price of prescription drugs and our amazing veterans are no longer left to languish and die on endless waiting lists, standing on line waiting for a doctor.	0
We pass V.A.	0
Choice, so they can see their doctor.	0
Our veterans were waiting on line for two days, seven days, three weeks, five weeks, you had veterans waiting on line that could have easily been taken care of.	0
They waited so long.	0
they became terminally ill in many cases, the stories are horrible.	0
We passed V.A.	0
choice.	0
You go out now, you get a doctor, you fix yourself up, the doctor sends us the bill, we pay for it, and you know what it doesn't matter, because the life and the veteran is more important, but we also happen to save a lot of money doing that, can you believe it?	0
V.A.	0
Choice for the veteran.	0
They've been trying to get that passed also for about 44 years.	0
Now we also passed V.A.	0
accountability so that when somebody does bad things or mistreats, our wonderful veterans, we couldn't do anything with them.	0
They were protected between civil service unions and all of the problems, it didn't matter, you couldn't do anything.	0
"Now, you can just say, ""You're fired, get out, get out, get out."""	0
And as we fight to make life better for all Americans, the Democrat Party has become more radical, more dangerous and more unhinged than at any point in the modern history of our country or no issue are Democrats more extreme and more depraved than when it comes to border security.	0
The Democrat agenda of open borders is morally reprehensible.	0
It's the greatest betrayal of the American middle class and, frankly, American life.	0
Our country, has a hole, nobody sees anything like it, people are pouring in, but we've stopped them, and now, as I said, we have other people helping us, including the country of Mexico.	0
Let's see how it works out, but we need you to call your Democrat Congressman and your Democrat Senator and get them to pass legislation.	0
Working with these great men over here to close up the loopholes and to solve the asylum problem which can be done in 15 minutes.	0
Illegal mass migration brings in millions of low wage workers to compete for jobs, wages and opportunities against the most vulnerable Americans cutting off their path to the American dream.	0
Thanks to Democrat policies, schoolchildren across the country are being threatened by the vicious gang MS-13.	0
That iCE, by the way, is taking out of our country and dropping them back home by the thousands, by the thousands.	0
Mass illegal migration, reduces living standards and strains public resources.	0
If Democrat officials had to send their children to those overcrowded overburdened schools, they would not tolerate it for one minute.	0
What's happening with their policies are horrible.	0
Our immigration laws are a disgrace and the Democrats can get together with the Republicans and solve the problem quickly.	0
One meeting.	0
Democrats in California even voted to give free health care to illegal aliens instead of helping homeless Americans in Democrat run cities.	0
Democrats support sanctuary cities.	0
Thank you, Governor Ron, for ending that whole disaster.	0
They release dangerous criminal aliens into our communities.	0
Ron DeSantis, great job.	0
Great.	0
Really great, thank you.	0
So small.	0
It's commonsense.	0
It's commonsense.	0
Sanctuary cities are an open attack on American law enforcement and American families.	0
Sacrificing American lives in pursuit of a callous political agenda.	0
That's all it is.	0
No one who supports sanctuary cities should be allowed to run for president of the United States, Republicans believe welfare, schools, hospitals, and public resources should be protected for all Americans.	0
And yes, yes, we are doing things that few others have even tried to do we are making progress like nobody would believe.	0
Wait 'til you see some of the things that you're going to be hearing about over the next few months.	0
We believe our country should be a sanctuary for law abiding citizens not for criminal aliens, and we will always support and protect the heroes of ICE border patrol and law enforcement generally throughout our country.	0
Thank you.	0
And in the ultimate act of moral cowardice, not one Democrat candidate for president, not a single one, has stood up to defend the incredible men and women of ICE and border patrol, the job they do is incredible, against all odds with the bad laws.	0
They don't have the character, the virtue, the spine to do it, we have to thank them and we have to thank, boy, law enforcement.	0
What a job they do.	0
It's time to pass Kate's Law, end sanctuary cities, end catch and release, deport vicious gang members, which we're doing, stop human trafficking, stop illegal immigration, and establish a modern immigration system based on skills contributions and based on merit.	0
We want people to come into our country based on merit more than 120 Democrats in Congress have also signed up to support crazy Bernie Sanders socialist government takeover of healthcare.	0
He seems not to be doing too well lately.	0
They want to end Medicare as we know it and terminate the private health insurance of 180 million Americans who love their health insurance.	0
America will never be a socialist country, ever.	0
Republicans do not believe in socialism, we believe in freedom, and so do you.	0
We will defend Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors.	0
We will defend it like nobody else.	0
And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.	0
Always, always.	0
Virtually, every top Democrat also now supports taxpayer-funded abortion right up to the moment of birth.	0
Ripping baby straight from the mother's womb, leading Democrats have even opposed measures to prevent the execution of children after birth.	0
You saw that.	0
In Virginia, republicans believe that every life is a sacred gift from God.	0
That is why I have asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion.	0
Day by day, we are rebuilding our country, our home, we are restoring America's standing all around the world.	0
We are respected as a country again.	0
After past leaders slash military budgets, we are rebuilding the U.S armed forces with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year, far more than ever before.	0
And with the help of Vice President Mike Pence, we are creating the space force, that's where it's going to be, the space force.	0
We're insisting that our foreign partners and allies pay their fair share, and thanks to our brave warriors, the ISIS caliphate that you've been hearing so much about, has been totally obliterated 100%.	0
We have repaired America's friendship with our cherished ally, the state of Israel.	0
And as I heard, Mike, saying before, we recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem and we recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.	0
And I withdrew the United States from the disaster -- i's a disaster, a disaster, the disastrous Iran nuclear deal and imposed the toughest ever sanctions on the world's No.	0
1 state sponsor of terrorism.	0
We're charting a path to stability and peace in the Middle East, because great nations do not want to fight endless wars.	0
They've been going on forever.	0
Starting to remove a lot of troops.	0
We're finally putting America first.	0
In Latin America, our country once again stands against corrupt communist and socialist regimes, and we support the people of Cuba and Venezuela in their righteous struggle for freedom.	0
Thank you, Marco.	0
Thank you, Rick.	0
Thank you, Lindsey.	0
And nothing would make us happier than to be able to work with Democrats to rebuild our nation's infrastructure, to bring down drug prices, to compete with other countries and to dominate the future as one American team.	0
It can happen.	0
It can happen, it can happen.	0
It's looking like the Democratic Party does not want to do that, but it can happen, and it very well might.	0
There's so many great things we can do right now in a bipartisan way, but they've been afflicted with an ideological sectors that protects foreign borders, but refuses to protect our borders that promotes jobs overseas, but allows our factories to close, that promotes democracy abroad, but shreds our Constitution at home.	0
That declares support for free speech and free thought, but relentlessly suppresses them both and that constantly savages the heroes of American law enforcement.	0
We don't want that, we don't want that.	0
No matter what label they use.	0
A vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream.	0
So don't ever forget, this election is about you.	0
It's about your family, your future and the fate of your country.	0
We begin our campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for our country's future.	0
Together, we will continue unleashing the power of American enterprise, so every American can know the dignity of work and the pride of a paycheck.	0
We will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, and lawful system of immigration.	0
It will be a system of immigration that strengthens our country, upholds our values and protects our way of life.	0
We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are promptly stamped with the words Made in the U.S.A. We will create a great health care system based on honesty, transparency, more options, and far lower costs for much better care.	0
We will give school choice to millions of underserved children who are trapped in failing schools and failing school system.	0
We will continue rescuing our inner cities from disastrous reign of Democrats, who presided over the decimation of their education systems, the outsourcing of their jobs, and the devastation of their neighborhoods.	0
We will expand opportunity zones so that no community is ever left behind.	0
Thank you, Tim Scott, great help.	0
In the face of new threats, we will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms.	0
We will protect our Second Amendment.	0
We will push onward with new medical frontiers.	0
We will come up with the cures to many, many problems, to many, many diseases, including cancer and others, and we're getting closer all the time.	0
We will eradicate AIDS in America once and for all and we're very close.	0
We will lay the foundation for landing American astronauts on the surface of Mars and, above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that hold us together.	0
As one America, we believe in the American Constitution and the rule of law.	0
We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life.	0
We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way.	0
We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag, and we will live by the words of our national motto: In God we Trust.	0
Powered by these values, we won a victory two and a half years ago, we won a victory for every parent worried for their children and worried about their children.	0
They were concerned that their children wouldn't have the same opportunity as they had, we're going to make that opportunity even better.	0
We won a victory for every mom and dad who lost a job, because our leaders wave the white flag of economic surrender, you've seen that too much.	0
We won a victory for American self-government, self rule and self determination.	0
We have been blessed by God with the greatest nation on the face of the earth and we are going to keep it that way.	0
We are going to keep it that way.	0
With your help, with your love and your devotion and with your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.	0
We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God.	0
And together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again and we will make America great again.	0
Thank you, Orlando.	0
Thank you.	0
Florida.	0
Well, thank you very much, everybody.	0
Appreciate it.	0
We've had a very amazing two-day period in Brussels.	0
And we really accomplished a lot, with respect to NATO.	0
For years, Presidents have been coming to these meetings and talked about the expense -- the tremendous expense for the United States.	0
And tremendous progress has been made; everyone has agreed to substantially up their commitment.	0
They're going to up it at levels that they've never thought of before.	0
Prior to last year, where I attended my first meeting, it was going down -- the amount of money being spent by countries was going down and down very substantially.	1
And now, it's going up very substantially.	1
And commitments were made.	0
Only 5 of 29 countries were making their commitment.	0
And that's now changed.	0
The commitment was at 2 percent.	0
Ultimately, that'll be going up quite a bit higher than that.	0
So we are -- we made a tremendous amount of progress today.	0
It's been about, at a minimum, they estimate -- and they're going to be giving you exact numbers -- but since last year, they've raise an additional $33 billion that's been put up by the various countries, not including the United States.	0
And the United States' commitment to NATO is very strong, remains very strong, but primarily because everyone -- the spirit they have, the amount of money they're willing to spend, the additional money that they will be putting up has been really, really amazing to see it.	0
To see the level of spirit in that room is incredible.	0
And I hope that we're going to be able to get along with Russia.	0
I think that we probably will be able to.	0
The people in the room think so, but they nevertheless -- they really stepped up their commitment, and stepped it up like they never have before. So took in an addition $33	0
[billion]	0
. The number could actually be higher than $40	0
[billion]	0
when they give you the final number.	0
The Secretary General, Stoltenberg, will be giving those numbers sometime today, probably in his concluding press statement.	0
But we are doing numbers like they've never done before or ever seen before.	0
And you'll be seeing that, and I guess you'll be hearing that a little bit later.	0
Okay.	0
We have our Secretary of State, as you know, and we have -- John is here.	0
So if you have any questions for the three of us.	0
Mike Pompeo just got back from a third trip, as you know, to North Korea.	0
He's become a true expert on the trips to North Korea -- the best way to get there, the best way to get out.	0
And he gets along very well.	0
And he's doing a great job over there.	0
Yes, ma'am.	0
I have a question.	0
Yes.	0
Mr. President, I'm Tara McKelvey with the BBC.	0
Can you tell us whether or not you warned people that the U.S. would pull out of NATO if they weren't meeting their spending goals?	0
I told people that I'd be very unhappy if they didn't up their commitments very substantially, because the United States has been paying a tremendous amount, probably 90 percent of the cost of NATO.	0
And now, people are going to start and countries are going to start upping their commitments.	0
So I let them know yesterday, actually.	0
I was surprised that you didn't pick it up; it took until today.	0
But yesterday, I let them know that I was extremely unhappy with what was happening, and they have substantially upped their commitment, yeah.	0
And now we're very happy and have a very, very powerful, very, very strong NATO, much stronger than it was two days ago.	0
Yes, ma'am.	0
Hi, President Trump.	0
Yes, hi.	0
How are you?	0
I'm the White House Correspondent for PBS --	0
I know.	0
You're very famous on television.	0
I have a question, again, about -- did you ever, at any point, say that the U.S., though, might stop engaging with NATO?	0
And do you think that your rhetoric helps NATO cohesion, or are you worried that people might think that U.S. might not be as committed to NATO?	0
There are a lot of people who say they were worried and stressed by what you did yesterday.	0
Well, they were probably worried because the United States was not being treated fairly, but now we are, because the commitment has been upped so much.	0
So now they are.	0
And I was very firm yesterday.	0
You have to understand, I know a lot of the people in the room.	0
I was here last year.	0
I let them know last year -- in a less firm manner, but pretty firm -- and they raised an additional $33 billion, I think going to $40 billion.	0
But it's $33 billion as of today.	0
And then today and yesterday, I was probably a little bit more firm.	0
But I believe in NATO.	0
I think NATO is a very important -- probably the greatest ever done.	0
But the United States was paying for anywhere from 70 to 90 percent of it, depending on the way you calculate.	1
That's not fair to the United States.	0
In addition to that, as you know, we're in negotiations with the EU, and we're going to be meeting with them next week.	0
We've been treated very unfairly on trade.	0
Our farmers have been shut out of the European Union.	0
Now, you could say they're different, but basically, to a large extent, they're the same countries.	0
So I think we're going to be ultimately treated fairly on trade.	0
We'll see what happens, but I can tell you that NATO now is really a fine-tuned machine.	0
People are paying money that they never paid before.	0
They're happy to do it.	0
And the United States is being treated much more fairly.	0
Yes, sir.	0
President Trump, Ryan Chilcote, PBS NewsHour.	0
Did you win concessions in your meetings and discussions with the German Chancellor when it comes to German defense spending and also with this issue of purchasing energy from Russia?	0
And secondly, what would you say to your critics that say by creating this scene here at NATO you're only enabling President Putin and Russia to further disturb things in Ukraine and Georgia?	0
Well, if you consider putting up tremendously -- you know, the additional funds at a level that nobody has ever seen before, I don't think that's helping Russia.	0
I think that NATO is much stronger now than it was two days ago.	0
I think that NATO was not doing what they were supposed to be doing -- a lot of the countries.	0
And we were doing much more than we should have been doing.	0
Frankly, we were carrying too much of a burden.	0
"That's why we call it ""burden-sharing."""	0
I was using the term a lot today.	0
Burden-sharing.	0
We had a fantastic meeting at the end -- 29 countries.	0
And they are putting up a lot.	0
Germany has increased very substantially their time period, and Germany is coming along.	0
And we still have to figure out what's going on with the pipeline, because the pipeline is coming in from Russia.	0
So we're going to have to figure that out.	0
I brought it up; nobody brought it up but me, and we all are talking about it now.	0
And actually, I think the world is talking about it now maybe more than anything else.	0
But we're going to figure that out.	0
But -- and, frankly, maybe everybody is going to have a good relationship with Russia so there will be a lot less problem with the pipeline.	0
But, to me, that was a very major point of contention.	0
We discussed it at length today.	0
Germany has agreed to do a lot better than they were doing, and we're very happy with that.	0
We had a very good relationship with Angela Merkel.	0
Yes.	0
Mr. President --	0
Yeah, go ahead.	0
Hi.	0
Thank you.	0
Margaret Talev from Bloomberg.	0
Yes.	0
After all these years, I know, Margaret.	0
Go ahead.	0
Thank you.	0
Maybe I'm being dense here, but could you just clarify: Are you still threatening to potentially pull the United States out of NATO for any reason?	0
And do you believe you can do that without Congress's explicit support and approval?	0
I think I probably can, but that's unnecessary.	0
And the people have stepped up today like they've never stepped up before.	0
And remember the word -- $33 billion more, they're paying.	0
And you'll hear that from the Secretary General in a little while.	0
He thanked me actually.	0
He actually thanked me.	0
And everybody in the room thanked me.	0
There's a great collegial spirit in that room that I don't think they've had in many years.	0
They're very strong.	0
So, yeah, very unified, very strong.	0
No problem.	0
Right?	0
Yes, go ahead.	0
We're in NATO.	0
No -- no --	0
No problem.	0
Go ahead.	0
Mr. President, Jonathan Lemire with the Associated Press.	0
You have said previously you wanted the countries to step up their spending to 2 percent.	0
Yesterday there was a suggestion it might be 4 percent, or perhaps 2 percent at a much quicker timetable.	0
Can you clarify, what did they commit to doing?	0
Is that satisfactory to you?	0
So what they're doing is spending at a much faster clip.	0
They're going up to the 2 percent level.	0
Now, you have to understand, some of them have parliaments, they have their own congresses, they have a lot of things they have to go through.	0
So, you know, they're here as prime minister or a as a president, and they can't necessarily go in and say, this is what we're going to do.	0
But they're going back for approvals.	0
Some are at 2 percent; others have agreed definitely to go to 2 percent.	0
And some are going back to get the approval, and which they will get, to go to 2 percent.	0
After the 2 percent, we'll start talking about going higher.	0
But I said, ultimately we should be, in years -- in advance -- we should be at 4 percent.	0
I think 4 percent, it's the right number.	0
Now, the United States -- depending on the way you calculate it -- was at 4.2 percent.	0
And I said, that's unfair.	0
And we have the largest GDP by far, especially since we've increased it by so much since a thing called the election.	0
Our GDP has gone way up.	0
And so the fact that our GDP went way up, that means we're paying for even more, which is very unfair.	0
So I explained that.	0
We will go to much higher than 2 percent into the future, but right now we're getting people up to 2 percent, and that will take place over a fairly short period of time -- a short number of years.	0
Okay?	0
Yeah, go ahead. Hi, Tomas LeCrass from	0
[Inaudible]	0
journalist Croatia Daily Newspaper.	0
We understand your message --	0
Congratulations, by the way.	0
Thank you.	0
On soccer.	0
Thank you.	0
We understand your message, but some people ask themselves, will you be tweeting differently once you board the Air Force One?	0
Thank you.	0
No, that's other people that do that.	0
I don't.	0
I'm very consistent.	0
I'm a very stable genius.	0
[Laughter]	0
Go ahead.	0
Yeah, go ahead.	0
Thank you, sir.	0
Jeremy Diamond with CNN.	0
How are you?	0
Hi, Jeremy.	0
Quick question with regards to Germany and the comments that you made yesterday.	0
Do you feel like given the threats that you made about potentially leaving NATO, about insulting Germany's sovereignty, it appears, by suggesting that they're totally controlled by Russia -- do you feel like that's an effective way to conduct diplomacy?	0
And secondly, would you be able to be a little bit more specific about the commitments that you secured today with regards to increasing the financial commitment?	0
Is there an updated timeline?	0
Are there specific countries you could cite?	0
Because a majority of them were already planning to meet that 2 percent threshold by 2024.	0
No, many of them -- in fact, Germany was going to be in the year 2028 or '30.	0
Yeah, I think it's a very effective way to deal, but I didn't deal exactly the way you said.	0
I have great respect for Germany.	0
My father is from Germany.	0
Both of my parents are from the EU, despite the fact they don't treat us well on trade.	0
But I think that will change also, and I think we'll see that -- because on the 25th of July, they're coming in to start negotiations with me.	0
We'll see.	0
And if they don't negotiate in good faith, we'll do something having to do with all of the millions of cars that are coming into our country and being taxed at a virtually zero level, at a very low level.	0
But, Jeremy, I think it's been a very effective way of negotiating.	0
But I'm not negotiating; I just want fairness for the United States.	0
We're paying for far too much of NATO.	0
NATO is very important.	0
But NATO is helping Europe more than it's helping us.	0
At the same time, it's very good for us.	0
So we have now got it to a point where people are paying a lot more money, and that's starting -- really, last year.	0
It really had -- you were there last year.	0
And last year we had a big impact.	0
Again, we took in $33 billion more.	0
And if you ask Secretary General Stoltenberg, he gives us total credit -- meaning me, I guess, in this case, total credit -- because I said it was unfair.	0
"Now, what has happened is, presidents over many years, from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama, they came in, they said, ""Okay, hey, do the best you can,"" and they left."	0
Nobody did anything about it.	0
And it got to a point where the United States was paying for 90 percent of NATO.	0
And that's not fair.	0
So it's changed	0
We had a really good meeting today.	0
We had a great meeting in terms of getting along.	0
I know most of the people in the room because of last year, because of the year and a half that we've been in office -- year and a half-plus.	0
But we have a great relationship.	0
Everybody in that room, by the time we left, got along.	0
And they agreed to pay more, and they agreed to pay it more quickly.	0
Yeah, go ahead, Phil.	0
Thanks, Mr. President.	0
Philip Rucker from the Washington Post.	0
"You tweeted yesterday, ""What good is NATO?"""	0
And you've talked about NATO as an alliance that benefits Europe, that defends and protects Europe.	0
Do you see any value of NATO to the United States vis-a-vis Russia?	0
Does it help protect the United States from Russia, in your view?	0
I think it's another very strong ally, as together it's much stronger than, obviously, individual countries.	0
I think it's -- the way we have it now, I think it's a much -- I think NATO got -- you know what was happening with spending prior to my getting into office.	0
The numbers were going down.	0
Now the numbers have gone up like a rocket ship.	0
The numbers have gone up a lot, and they've gone up rapidly.	0
And they're now going up further.	0
So I think NATO is going to be very, very effective.	0
I'm very impressed with -- and really know, and he's a friend mine -- but Secretary General Stoltenberg has done a fantastic job and putting it all together.	0
And we were the ones that really -- we gave him an extension of his contract, as you know.	0
I think he's done a really good job.	0
I think that when I was saying that I am very concerned with the pipeline, I don't like the pipeline.	0
And when I talk about NATO, I say, how do you have NATO?	0
And then you have somebody paying the people that you're protecting against.	0
But maybe we'll get along with the group that we're protecting against.	0
I think that's a real possibility.	0
As you know, I'm meeting with President Putin on Monday.	0
And I think we go into that meeting not looking for so much.	0
We want to find out about Syria.	0
We will, of course, ask your favorite question about meddling.	0
I will be asking that question again.	0
But we'll also be talking about other things.	0
We'll be talking about Ukraine.	0
Ukraine was here today, by the way.	0
And, you know, it was very interesting to hear what they had to say?	0
[Inaudible]	0
Excuse me?	0
What if he denies it?	0
Well, he may.	0
I mean, look, he may.	0
You know, what am I going to do?	0
He may deny it.	0
I mean, it's one of those things.	0
"All I can do is say, ""Did you"" and ""Don't do it again."""	0
But he may deny it.	0
You'll be the first to know.	0
Okay?	0
Yes, go ahead.	0
Mr. President, Robert Wall with the Wall Street Journal.	0
Yes.	0
Hi, Robert.	0
If the Germans and the Canadians and others don't come up to 2 percent, what is your fallback position?	0
How will you up the pressure to make them actually?	0
Well, they will.	0
They will.	0
I have no doubt about it.	0
They all made commitments.	0
And they will be up to 2 percent.	0
It will be over a period -- a relatively short period of years.	0
Okay?	0
Please.	0
Thank you so much.	0
Yes, go ahead. Georgian TV	0
[Inaudible]	0
. Mr. President, what do you think today, it needs --	0
[Inaudible]	0
Georgia more support from NATO?	0
And I wanted to ask about --	0
Georgia?	0
They were here today, representing.	0
Yes.	0
And will you talk about Georgia in a meeting with President Putin?	0
Well, they were here.	0
They made a very favorable impression.	0
And we listened to their plight.	0
It's a tough situation with Georgia.	0
But they made a very fair verbal impression in the room.	0
Okay?	0
Yeah, go ahead.	0
Go.	0
Go.	0
Go ahead.	0
She's already had one.	0
Yeah, you really did.	0
Come on.	0
Go ahead.	0
Go ahead.	0
Well, I had a question, as well.	0
But nonetheless, I'll ask, sir.	0
Will you recognize --	0
Go ahead.	0
Will you recognize Russia's annex -- will you recognize Crimea as part of Russia when you meet President --	0
Oh, that's an interesting question -- because long before I got here, President Obama allowed that to happen.	0
That was on his watch, not on my watch.	0
"You know, people like to say, ""Oh, Crimea."""	0
But the fact is, they built bridges to Crimea.	0
They just opened a big bridge that was started years ago.	0
They built, I think, a submarine port; substantially added billions of dollars.	0
So that was on Barack Obama's watch.	0
That was not on Trump's watch.	0
Would I have allowed it to happen?	0
No, I would not have allowed it to happen.	0
But he did allow it to happen, so that was his determination.	0
What will happen with Crimea from this point on?	0
That I can't tell you.	0
But I'm not happy about Crimea.	0
But again, that was on Barack Obama's watch, not Trump's watch.	0
Yeah, go ahead.	0
Sure.	0
It's Jeff Mason from Reuters, Mr. President.	0
Sure.	0
I know, Jeff.	0
Regarding your summit with President Putin, will you be raising arms control issues?	0
Yes.	0
Would you like to extend New START?	0
And will you raise concerns about violations of the INF Treaty?	0
Yes.	0
And as a follow-up to the NATO meeting today, will you suggest to him, or would you consider stopping military exercises in the Baltic States, if that's something that he requests?	0
Well, perhaps we'll talk about that.	0
But I will say that we are going to be talking about those three issues and many more.	0
We'll be talking about it, Jeff.	0
Go ahead.	0
Go ahead.	0
[Inaudible]	0
We are in the NATO, the quarters -- the cost	0
[Inaudible]	0
the double	0
[Inaudible]	0
before.	0
I would like to know if you are planning to guarantee the taxpayers that the new money that is flowing into NATO will be spent in the best possible way, especially the money coming from country that have several problem with the public finances.	0
Well, the money will be spent properly.	0
And one of the things that we have -- we have many wealthy countries with us today, but we have some that aren't so wealthy.	0
And they did ask if they could buy the military equipment and could I help them out.	0
And we will help them out a little bit.	0
We're not going to finance it for them, but we'll make sure that they're able to get payments and various other things so they can buy.	0
Because the United States makes, by far, the best military equipment in the world.	0
The best jets, the best missiles, the best guns.	0
The best everything -- we make, by far.	0
I mean, that's one thing -- I guess I assumed it prior to taking office, but I really learned, since being President, our equipment is so much better than anybody else's equipment when you look at our companies -- Lockheed and Boeing and Grumman.	0
The material -- the equipment that we make is so far superior, everybody wants to buy our equipment.	0
In fact, it's the question, can they make it?	0
Because they are doing very well.	0
Can they make it for so many people?	0
So we are helping some of those countries get on line and buy the best equipment.	0
Yeah, go ahead.	0
Hi, I'm Kristin Brown with Fox News.	0
On your upcoming summit with President Putin, did any of your allies here express any specific concerns or talk to you about any messages that they'd like you to take with you when you go to the summit?	0
Yeah.	0
Just the opposite of concern.	0
They actually -- and they'll probably come out with a little bit of an edict -- but they actually thanked me for meeting with President Putin.	0
I look forward to the meeting.	0
They thanked me.	0
They thought it was a great thing that I was doing it.	0
And they gave us our best wishes, or their best wishes.	0
Now, with that being said, we'll see that happens.	0
Just a loose meeting.	0
It's not going to be big schedule.	0
I don't think it should take a very long period of time.	0
And we'll see where it leads.	0
But it could lead to productive -- something very productive.	0
And maybe it's not.	0
But I think meeting with people is great.	0
We had a great meeting with Chairman Kim.	0
And I'll tell you, Mike Pompeo did a fantastic job.	0
I might ask you to say a few words, Mike, while you're here.	0
Just one second.	0
Mike, go ahead.	0
Thank you, Mr. President.	0
So, I did.	0
I returned -- I actually came straight from North Korea with a couple of stops here to Brussels.	0
We had a productive conversation.	0
There remains a great deal of work to do, but I think, most importantly, my counterpart, Kim Yong Chol, made a commitment consistent with what President Trump was able to achieve with Chairman Kim, which was: They intend to denuclearize.	0
They're going to accomplish it.	0
And now the task is to get it implemented.	0
I think, just to finish on that, you know, it's so important.	0
That was an amazing -- really, an amazing meeting, I though.	0
And I really think that we established a very good relationship.	0
We'll see where it all ends.	0
But there have been no missile tests.	0
There have been no research.	0
Where there has been -- they have blown up a site; I hear they're blowing up another site, missile site.	0
They've taken down all of the propaganda.	0
In fact, somebody said there's no more music playing at the border line.	0
You know, the music was going on for many years.	0
"They said recently that, ""Wow, there's no more of the heavy music and the propaganda."""	0
They've done a lot of things.	0
And we got back our three hostages.	0
So it's a good process.	0
But the main thing is there have been no rocket launches.	0
There have been no missile tests.	0
There's been no nuclear tests, no explosions, no nothing, for almost nine months.	0
Okay.	0
Yeah, please.	0
Ewen MacAskill from The Guardian.	0
Your trip to the UK, there are lots of protests planned in London and elsewhere.	0
How do you feel about that?	0
I think it's fine.	0
I mean, I think they like me a lot in the UK.	0
I think they agree with me on immigration.	0
I'm very strong on immigration.	0
I made a point today -- I said, you've got to stop.	0
You're ruining your -- you're going to have a lot of problems.	0
You see what's going on throughout the world with immigration.	0
I probably, at least partially, won an election because of immigration.	0
If you look at Italy -- Giuseppe, who I got to know quite well over the last month and a half, he won his election because of strong immigration policies on Italy.	0
I think that a lot of the people in the UK -- I think that's why Brexit happened.	0
Now, I don't know what's going on with the negotiation.	0
Who knows.	0
But -- and I guess that's become a very interesting point of contention	0
I said I'm going to a few hotspots.	0
We have NATO, then we have the UK, and then we have Putin.	0
And I said, Putin may be the easiest of them all.	0
You never know.	0
But I'm going to a pretty hotspot right now, right, with a lot of resignations.	0
But I will say that immigration is a very important thing, and I told them today, the EU -- the European Union -- better be very careful, because immigration is taking over Europe, and they better be very, very careful.	0
And I said that loud and clear.	0
Yes, go ahead. President Trump,	0
[Inaudible]	0
Romania.	0
What will you tell President Putin about this summit and about NATO?	0
Well, I think he's going to see about this summit -- this has turned out to be a very successful summit.	0
This is -- I think, really, that NATO is more put together right now, is more coordinated.	0
And I think there's a better spirit for NATO right now than perhaps they've ever had.	0
It's richer than it ever was.	0
The commitments are made at a higher level than they've ever been made.	0
And the money, it will be paid out faster -- far faster.	0
You know, the 2 percent was a range, a goal.	0
It wasn't something that they were committed to.	0
Now it's a commitment.	0
There's a big difference -- the 2 percent number.	0
And that's why so many people weren't reaching it or hitting it.	0
It was just sort of like this amorphous number out there.	0
Now it's a commitment, a real commitment.	0
I think he's going to see that there's great unity, great spirit, great esprit de corps.	0
And I think we're going to have a good meeting.	0
Regardless of that, I think we're going to have a good meeting.	0
But this was a fantastic two days.	0
This was a really fantastic -- it all came together at the end.	0
And, yes, it was a little tough for a little while, but ultimately -- you can ask anybody at that meeting -- they're really liking what happened over the last two days.	0
There's a great, great spirit leaving that room.	0
Yes, sir.	0
Go ahead.	0
Please.	0
Yeah.	0
Jonathan Beale from BBC.	0
I just wonder -- you think you're going to get along with President Putin at that meeting.	0
Could you just tell us, why do you think that?	0
Is there something you admire about him?	0
And the second question, because you're just about to go to the UK, sir --	0
Well, he's a competitor.	0
He's been very nice to me the times I've met him.	0
I've been nice to him.	0
He's a competitor.	0
"You know, somebody was saying, ""Is he an enemy?"""	0
No, he's not my enemy.	0
Is he a friend?	0
No, I don't know him well enough.	0
But the couple of times that I've gotten to meet him, we got along very well.	0
You saw that.	0
I hope we get along well.	0
I think we get along well.	0
But ultimately, he's a competitor.	0
He's representing Russia.	0
I'm representing the United States.	0
So in a sense, we're competitors.	0
Not a question of friend or enemy.	0
He's not my enemy.	0
And hopefully, someday, maybe he'll be a friend.	0
It could happen.	0
But I -- I just don't know him very well.	0
I've met him a couple of times.	0
And when I did meet him, most of you people were there.	0
Yes.	0
And Brexit -- sorry, sir, because you are going to the UK.	0
What will be your message on Brexit?	0
Well, Brexit is a -- you know, I've been reading a lot about Brexit over the last couple of days, and it seems to be turning a little bit differently where they're getting at least partially involved back with the European Union.	0
I have no message.	0
It's not for me to say.	0
I own a lot of property there.	0
I'm going to Scotland while I wait for the meeting.	0
I have Turnberry in Scotland, which is a magical place -- one of my favorite places.	0
I'm going there for two days while I wait for the Monday meeting.	0
But it's not for me to say what they should be doing in the UK.	0
I have great friendships.	0
My mother was born in Scotland.	0
I have great friendships over there.	0
We have a wonderful ambassador -- Woody Johnson.	0
And he's doing -- by the way, Woody is doing a great job.	0
But it's not for me to say.	0
I'd like to see him be able to work it so it could go quickly, whatever they work out.	0
Hard Brexit?	0
Is it heartbreaking?	0
Hard Brexit.	0
Oh, hard Brexit.	0
I see.	0
[Laughter]	0
I thought you said it was heartbreaking.	0
I said, that might be going a little bit too far, right?	0
[Laughter]	0
Heartbreak.	0
Is it heartbreaking?	0
A lot of things are heartbreaking.	0
No, I would say that Brexit is Brexit.	0
"It's not like -- I guess we'll use the term ""hard Brexit."""	0
I assume that's what you mean.	0
The people voted to break it up, so I would imagine that's what they'll do.	0
But maybe they're taking a little bit of a different route.	0
So I don't know if that's what they voted for.	0
I just want the people to be happy.	0
They're great people.	0
And I do think I have -- I'm sure there will be protests, because there are always protests.	0
But I think -- there were protests the night of the election, both ways.	0
But in the end, we got 206 electoral -- 306 electoral votes.	0
And one state said -- you know, it was interesting, one of the states we won, Wisconsin -- I didn't even realize this until fairly recently -- that was the one state Ronald Reagan didn't win when he ran the board his second time.	1
He didn't win Wisconsin, and we won Wisconsin.	0
So, you know, we had a great night.	0
Protests?	0
There might be protests.	0
But I believe that the people in the UK -- Scotland, Ireland.	0
As you know, I have property in Ireland; I have property all over.	0
I think that those people, they like me a lot, and they agree with me on immigration.	0
And I think that's why you have Brexit in the first place, because of immigration.	0
Yes, ma'am.	0
Yeah, go ahead.	0
[Inaudible]	0
from Finland.	0
What would be the best deal with Putin when you come to Helsinki?	0
And don't you think that your hard diplomacy -- that you are playing to the same goal that Putin, with your hard diplomacy towards EU and NATO?	0
Well, I can't tell you what would be the ultimate.	0
What would be the ultimate?	0
Well, let's see: No more nuclear weapons anywhere in the world would be the ultimate, okay?	0
No more wars, no more problems, no more conflict.	0
Let's find a cure to every disease known to mankind, or womankind.	0
That would be my ultimate, okay?	0
And we'll start from there.	0
Okay.	0
Yeah, go ahead.	0
[Inaudible]	0
from Afghan Service and BBC World Service.	0
So I would like to ask you, Mr. President, that Afghan President is going to be here --	0
He's here right now.	0
He's here right now.	0
No, is here.	0
And are you going to meet him?	0
Yes.	0
And what have you got to say to him?	0
Ghani.	0
And when the war is going to end in Afghanistan?	0
Because people are fed up now and they want to know.	0
I agree with that.	0
I very much agree.	0
It's been going on for a long time.	0
We've made a lot of progress, but it's been going on for a long time.	0
We've made a lot of progress in Afghanistan, I will say.	0
Yes, your President is here right now.	0
In fact, he's in the room.	0
When I'm finished with this, I'm going right back into that room.	0
One question, please.	0
Please.	0
Georgia Public Broadcasting.	0
Mr. President, can you tell us what do you think about future membership of Georgia in NATO, please?	0
Well, at a certain point they'll have a chance.	0
Not right now.	0
They just left the room.	0
But at a certain point, they'll have a chance.	0
Yes, sir.	0
Go ahead.	0
[Inaudible]	0
reporter for Kurdistan 24.	0
Are you going to continue to support the Kurdish forces, Peshmerga, in Iraq?	0
Thank you.	0
I think the Kurds are great people.	0
They're incredible fighters.	0
They're wonderful, warm, intelligent -- allies, in many cases.	0
As you know, it's different groups of people.	0
But they're great people.	0
I really do -- I believe they're great people.	0
Yes, go ahead, please. Mr. President,	0
[Inaudible]	0
working with ARD German TV.	0
You said Putin isn't an enemy, isn't a friend; he's just a competitor.	0
He's a competitor.	0
Do you consider him as a security threat for Europe or to the U.S.?	0
Thank you.	0
Hey, I don't want him to be.	0
And that's, I guess, why we have NATO, and that's why we have a United States that just had the largest military budget ever -- $700 billion approved; $716 billion next year.	0
No, I hope that we'll be able to get along.	0
I've said from day one, whether it's China or Russia -- you know, we're working on trade with China right now, and I don't say that's an easy situation, because that's been years of abuse of the United States by presidents, frankly, that allowed that to happen.	0
So I've taken over a lot of bad hands, and I'm fixing each one of them and I'm fixing them well.	0
But China is going to be, I think, very successfully, ultimately, taken care of.	0
I have a great respect for their President, as you know -- President Xi.	0
I spent two days there.	0
It was among the most magical two days I've ever lived.	0
And I think we're going to end up doing something very good with China.	0
Right now, we're in a pretty nasty trade battle, but I think ultimately that will work out.	0
I really think we have a big advantage.	0
You know, we've picked up $8 trillion in value, in worth, since I became President.	0
And we're close to two times the size of China.	0
A lot of people don't know that.	0
And, you know, we're going to negotiate a fair deal, if that's possible.	0
Okay.	0
And Russia -- I think getting along with Russia also would be a very good thing.	0
Yes, go ahead.	0
Jamal Mousavi from BCC Persian TV.	0
We have seen escalation of tension between you and the Iranians.	0
What is your exit plan, Mr. President?	0
I would say there might be an escalation between us and the Iranians.	0
I agree with that.	0
But they are threatening to --	0
By the way, they're treating us with much more respect right now than they did in the past.	0
And I think -- I know they're having a lot of problems and their economy is collapsing.	0
"But I will tell you this: At a certain point, they're going to call me and they're going to say, ""Let's make a deal,"" and we'll make a deal."	0
But they are -- they're feeling a lot of pain right now.	0
Yes.	0
Go ahead.	0
Go ahead.	0
Go ahead.	0
Go ahead.	0
Mr. President, do we expect the rise of the Russian influence in Macedonia following the starting of the negotiation process, like we've seen in Montenegro with alleged coup?	0
And what will NATO and United States do to counter that Russian influence in the Western Balkans?	0
Thank you.	0
We never talk about our future plans.	0
Yes, go ahead, ma'am.	0
Go ahead.	0
Go ahead.	0
Thank you very much, Mr. President.	0
Thank you very much.	0
My name is Alla Shali from Rudaw TV from Kurdistan Iraq.	0
My question is about the government of Iraq.	0
You know, after two months election, the government in Iraq has not been formed.	0
What's the role from USA?	0
And you want to talk about Syria with President Putin.	0
Can I have any information about Quds in Syria?	0
Thank you very much.	0
So I hope we get along well with Iraq.	0
We've certainly spent a great fortune in Iraq.	0
And many, many lives -- thousands and hundreds of thousands of lives, if you think on both sides, which I always think about both sides, not just our side.	0
And they had an election, and I hope we're going to be able to get along, and we'll see how that goes.	0
We've already been talking to the people that won the election.	0
I was not in favor of that war.	1
I was very much against that war.	1
I never thought it was a good thing.	0
But that's another deck of cards that I inherited, and we'll do the best we can with it.	0
I think the election was pretty conclusive.	0
And again, we've spoken to them.	0
We'll see what happens.	0
Yes, sir.	0
Go ahead.	0
Go ahead.	0
I'm Asea Atrouz from Assabah Newspaper in Tunisia.	0
I come from a very far country, a small country in Northern Africa, Tunisia. My question, Mr. President -- we really admire what you are doing in North Africa and we really wish and hope that something again will be done in the Middle East to avoid	0
[Inaudible]	0
more wars and more blood and more killings in the Middle East, with a just peace process that gives everyone its	0
[Inaudible]	0
.	0
We're looking for peace.	0
And Africa, as you know, is on our very strong list.	0
But we're looking for peace.	0
We want peace all over.	0
We want to solve problems.	0
We're looking for peace.	0
Africa, right now, has got problems like few people would even understand.	0
They have things going on there that nobody could believe in this room.	0
If you saw some of the things that I see through intelligence, what's going on in Africa, it is so sad and so vicious and violent.	0
And we want peace.	0
We want peace for Africa.	0
We want peace all over the world.	0
That's my number-one goal: peace all over the world.	0
And we're building up a tremendous military, because I really believe, through strength, you get peace.	0
But we're going to have a military like we've never had before.	0
We've given out orders for the best fighter jets in the world, the best ships, the best everything.	0
But hopefully we'll never have to use them.	0
That would be a dream.	0
To buy the best stuff, to have the best stuff, to have the best equipment in the world, and to never have to use it would be a really great part of my dream.	0
Thank you very much, everybody.	0
Thank you.	0
I'm going to be going -- leaving in about a half an hour.	0
Thank you.	0
Hello, Florida.	0
Hello.	0
Incredible people.	0
I am thrilled to be in this great state where we, by the way, had a great victory.	0
With thousands of hardworking American patriots who love our country and respect our great American flag.	0
We're honored to be joined tonight by some tremendous people.	0
Congressman Gus Bilirakis.	0
Gus!	0
Where is Gus?	0
Where is Gus?	0
Where is Gus?	0
Ted Yoho and Matt Gaetz.	0
Thank you.	0
Great, fellows.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, fellows.	0
I also want to recognize State Representative Jose Oliva and the former co-chairman of my Florida campaign, Representative Joe Gruters.	0
Joe?	0
Thank you, Joe.	0
Thank you.	0
"[Audience Member calls out ""We Love You""]"	0
And finally — I love you, too.	0
I'd like to introduce a true leader, a proud veteran, my great friend, a tough, brilliant cookie.	0
[Laughter]	0
True.	0
He's tough, he's smart, and he loves Florida, and he loves our country, and he's going to be your next governor, Ron DeSantis.	0
[Inaudible]	0
Welcome to Florida, Mr. President.	0
[Applause]	0
For someone who grew up just across the bay in Pinellas County, starting out working six bucks an hour, it's a true honor to be standing here, endorsed by the President of the United States.	0
I appreciate your support, Mr. President, but I appreciate more the leadership you're showing for our great country.	0
We have the strongest economy we've had in years.	0
We are standing foursquare behind our ally, the State of Israel.	0
We have strong Constitutionalists was being put on our courts, including the Supreme Court.	0
We have ended the disastrous Iran deal.	0
And under the president's leadership, we are standing against socialist dictatorships in Latin America like Cuba and Venezuela and Nicaragua.	0
Florida is going in the right direction, and we need to continue our success and build upon it.	0
We can't go back to the days of Charlie Crist, where the good ol' boys run the show.	0
[Booing]	0
We can make our state without peer for economic opportunity if we continue with strong Conservative policies.	0
We can fight illegal immigration.	0
All we've got to do is enact E-Verify and stop sanctuary cities.	0
We can end judicial activism in Florida by appointing solid Constitutionalists to our state courts, just like the president has done to the federal courts.	0
And we can improve our education system by stopping Common Core, by -- by giving every child, regardless of circumstance, the ability to attend a good school, and by getting the Constitution back in our classrooms in a very big way.	0
So, Mr. President, thank you for your support, thank you for what you're doing for the state of Florida.	0
I ask for your vote in the August primary, August 28th, I'd be honored to have it.	0
Thank you guys and God bless America, thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, Ron.	0
And everybody needs to support Ron DeSantis in our August 28th primary and in the November general election, don't forget.	0
You have somebody, one of the group is going to be running on open borders, anti-ICE, anti-law enforcement.	0
[Booing]	0
Oh, that's too bad, that's too bad.	0
That's too bad.	0
That's too bad.	0
One person – one person, and tomorrow the headlines will be massive protests.	0
[Laughter]	0
Too bad.	0
Sorry about that, Ron.	0
Earlier today I also spent time with your current Governor, one of our nation's truly great leaders, Rick Scott. As you know, Rick is running to replace liberal Democrat, Schumer-controlled, Nancy Pelosi-controlled ...	0
[Booing]	0
... And the new star of the Democrat Party, Maxine Waters.	0
[Booing]	0
Name is Bill Nelson, and you know I live a lot of time in Florida.	0
The only time I see Bill Nelson is five months before every election.	0
[Laughter]	0
And after a while you forget, who's the Senator?	0
But around five months you see him at parties and you see him around and we have to be careful, because we have to make sure that Rick Scott wins and wins big.	0
Bill Nelson voted for Obamacare, which has been a totally disastrous situation.	0
[Booing]	0
And we got rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular aspect and most of Obamacare will be gone very soon. In fact, it was gone until one gentleman decided at 2:00 in the morning ...	0
[Booing]	0
Remember?	0
Thank you very much, we appreciate it.	0
And he voted against tax cuts, and he wants to go in there and raise your taxes.	0
Tell me, is that good politics?	0
I don't think so. Bill Nelson voted in favor of sanctuary cities ...	0
[Booing]	0
He opposed Kate's Law.	0
Bill Nelson puts criminal aliens before American citizens, which is why it's time to vote Bill Nelson out of office.	0
That's what's going to happen.	0
And we have two unbelievable people — Ron DeSantis, Rick Scott — fighting for Florida.	0
They always will.	0
And fighting to make America great again.	0
That's what they're doing.	0
That's what they're doing.	0
So — I'm sure we all say this about our children, but I have great children.	0
And a couple of them-plus are here tonight.	0
I have Eric Trump, who's been fantastic.	0
He loves this political stuff.	0
Eric's wife, Lara, who is so great.	0
I think she singlehandedly won the state of North Carolina for Trump.	0
Thank you, Lara.	0
Didn't hurt in Pennsylvania, either.	0
Thank you very much.	0
And we have somebody that nobody ever heard of, Ivanka.	0
Ivanka.	0
Thank you.	0
And, you know, we have a big thing happening because you know this — look at all those hats.	0
"White ones, red ones, they all have the same thing, ""Make America Great."""	0
Well, make America great again.	0
"Only to be replaced by ""Keep America Great"" in about, I don't know, I guess we could do it now but let's wait another year."	0
We could do it right now, frankly.	0
We're doing fantastically well.	0
I also want to thank David Bossie for being here, Corey Lewandowski for being here, two of our great supporters.	0
I'll tell you, they are two fighters.	0
We like fighters, don't we?	0
We started off, it was a small group.	0
They said it couldn't be done.	0
It was actually done quite easily.	0
We won quite handily.	0
We were never left center stage.	0
You know what that means, right?	0
The debates.	0
We never left center stage.	0
"And I said, ""I always want odd numbers."""	0
Because I want to be in the center.	0
I didn't want to be tied for the center.	0
Does everybody understand?	0
But we never — we never left center stage.	0
And I'll tell you.	0
Corey, David, Ivanka, Lara, Eric, Don, Jr., all of them, they were fantastic.	0
They were fantastic.	0
And I have to say, our First Lady is home watching.	0
Look at all those cameras right there.	0
She's home watching.	0
And everybody loves Melania.	0
They love Melania.	0
Great.	0
Doing a fantastic thing.	0
She's doing a fantastic job.	0
Just last week, it was announced that the U.S. economy grew at 4.1 percent last quarter.	0
It was a number that everybody said was not reachable.	0
And I would never want to say it during the campaign, even though I believed it.	0
I believed it, because they would not have given us the break.	0
Fake news, fake news.	0
[Booing]	0
They are fake.	0
No, I mean, do you believe — look at this: Every night, it's the same thing.	0
Wouldn't you think they'd get tired of these speeches?	0
Wouldn't you think?	0
And here's one thing I'll tell you: If they don't get ratings, those speeches don't go on, doesn't matter.	0
Look how many they have back there.	0
They just can't get enough.	0
They can't get enough.	0
They cannot get enough.	0
And by the way, outside, if you want to go, we set up, for the first time, a tremendous movie screen, because we have thousands and thousands of people outside that couldn't get in.	0
So we have a big screen and big loudspeakers, and I hope you're all happy out there.	0
This is a great place to be.	0
If you've got to be outside, be outside in the great state of Florida, right?	0
Right?	0
So we're setting records like never before.	0
Since the election, we have added 3.7 million new jobs.	0
They would not have believed that.	0
We're in the longest positive job growth streak in history.	0
Think of that.	0
"Remember, I said, ""What do you have to lose?,"" right?"	0
What do I — OK?	0
What do you have to lose?	0
"And people said, ""I don't know."""	0
Is that a nice thing?	0
No, it's not nice, or not un-nice.	0
What do you have to lose?	0
The African-American unemployment rate has reached the lowest level in history — history.	0
Thank you.	0
You guys are great.	0
Thank you.	0
Blacks for Trump.	0
"They say, ""Blacks for Trump."""	0
You knew a long time ago, didn't you, huh?	0
You knew a long time ago.	0
Thank you, folks.	0
Thank you.	0
The Hispanic unemployment rate is at the lowest level in history, Hispanic.	0
The Asian unemployment rate has reached the lowest level in history.	0
Sorry about this, women, but the employment rate has reached the lowest level in only 65 years.	0
It'll be history soon.	0
It'll be.	0
It'll be history soon.	0
Give us about two more weeks.	0
[Audience Chants]	0
The veterans' unemployment rate — oh, do we love our veterans, right?	0
Has reached the lowest level in 18 years.	0
More than 3.5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps since the election.	0
American oil production is at an all-time high, we have never produced as much.	0
And the United States is now a net natural gas exporter for the first time in more than 60 years — 60.	0
We will very shortly be the largest in the world in energy, the largest in the world, think of that.	0
And most importantly, America is being respected again, we're respected again.	0
And I told the story the other day, I get to meet all these world leaders.	0
Virtually everyone comes into the Oval Office or wherever we're meeting and they don't know me.	0
I'm meeting them in many cases for the first time.	0
I'm not sure they like me, like in the case of NATO.	0
I said you got to pay your bills, folks, got to pay up, got to pay up.	0
But they liked it, they liked it.	0
But everyone that reached me says hello, Mr. President, congratulations on what you've done for the economy.	0
It's the talk of the world, talk of the world.	0
Now that we have the best economy in the history of our country, this is the time to straighten out the worst trade deals ever made by any country on Earth, they are the worst.	0
For decades, United States was the piggy bank that everybody was robbing. All of these other countries, our friends, our enemies, our allies...	0
[Booing]	0
The foe, foe.	0
We rebuilt China paying hundreds of billions of dollars a year with nobody there to protect your money.	0
But you're there now, we are protecting your money.	0
And I want to thank our farmers, our farmers are true patriots.	0
Because China and others have targeted – China and others, remember this, have targeted our farmers.	0
[Booing]	0
Not good, not nice.	0
And you know what our farmers are saying?	0
It's OK, we can take it.	0
These are incredible people, we can take it.	0
You know why?	0
They target our farmers because they know it's one of our great strengths.	0
It's us, it's not me, it's us altogether.	0
They know it's one of our great strengths.	0
We won every farm state, you're going to see that middle of that map – wasn't even the middle, it was about everything but a little corners of each side.	0
But you have to see, that is all red, Republican red, beautiful, Republican red.	0
And remember this, remember this.	0
Farms have been on a decline, I mean it's been for 15 years.	0
I've only been here for, you know – it's pretty soon going to be close to two years.	0
But if you look at soybeans – big crop.	0
If you go back to Election Day and then move back five years, so five years before Election Day, soybeans dropped 50 percent in price.	0
I wasn't even here, so now we're going to open up markets, We're going to do it the way it should be.	0
And all of this stuff, you're going to make it back and it's going to be made back faster than anybody would know.	0
But we haven't been treated right.	0
We're going to make it back nice and quickly.	0
Nice and quickly.	0
Now, after years of rebuilding foreign countries, it's time to finally rebuild our country, right?	0
Wouldn't you say?	0
Right?	0
In the past, politicians ran for office pledging to crack down on unfair trade.	0
They never did anything about it.	0
Only to get elected, and they just didn't do anything.	0
The United States was allowed to truly get ripped off.	0
[Booing]	0
But we're not going to let that happen.	0
I'm not like other politicians.	0
You've seen what happens.	0
I've kept my promises.	0
One of the brilliant pundits that has a — doesn't have a clue.	0
I mean, these people, how they have gotten us wrong.	0
"And you know what they were asking, Election Day, ""Where did all these people come from?"	0
"Where did they come from?"""	0
In Tennessee, that was an early state.	0
They came in and they were pouring in with the early vote.	0
"And the fake news was saying, ""Where are these people coming from?"""	0
[Laughter]	0
You know where they came from?	0
They came from the heart.	0
They came from people that were never happy with anybody until we came along.	0
That's where they came from.	0
That's where they came from.	0
"But one of the pundits said that ""He's made a lot of promises."	0
"And you won't believe it, but he's actually kept far more promises than he made."""	0
Did you ever hear that one?	0
So.	0
Of course they'll probably be throwing him out of broadcasting tomorrow.	0
We've taken the toughest-ever actions in response to China's abusive trade practices.	1
And we're doing very well with China, very well.	0
And I have a lot of respect for China.	0
And I have tremendous respect for President Xi of China.	0
But this has been too many years of abuse, $500 billion a year.	1
$500 billion.	0
We've helped rebuild China.	0
We can't do that anymore.	0
[Booing]	0
We can't do that anymore.	0
And our farmers understand it, and our workers understand it.	0
And, frankly, our companies understand it.	0
I was with one of the greatest companies in the world.	0
The chief executive officer, very short while ago.	0
And it really affects him.	0
"He said, ""You know what, this does affect our company."	0
But, Mr. President, keep going.	0
"You're doing the right thing."""	0
I thought it was great.	0
I thought it was great.	0
A great company, one of the greatest.	0
"He said, ""You're doing the right thing."""	0
"And I said, ""I appreciate it."""	0
Thanks to our powerful trade policies, the trade deficit is falling and falling and falling.	0
And, boy, did it fall this quarter.	0
The days of plundering American jobs and American wealth, those days are over, they're over.	0
America first — America first.	0
We're also living by two very important rules, buy American and hire American.	0
Last week I visited with hundreds of American steel workers, who were laid off years ago because other countries were dumping steel all over our country.	0
They're not dumping so much anymore, you notice?	0
And if they do, they're paying a 25 percent tariff or tax.	0
So you know what I say to that?	0
Dump all you want.	0
I hope you dump a lot.	0
[Laughter]	0
Now thanks to our tariffs, our steel workers are back on the job, American steel mills are back open for business, we are starting to set new records and nobody believed it could happen this quickly.	0
U.S. Steel just announced that they're building six new steel mills.	0
And that number's soon going to be lifted, but I'm not allowed to say that, so I won't.	0
[Laughter]	0
And I'm very proud to report that NuCor is going to build a brand new $240 million steel mill – that's a big one, right here in Florida, the head of NuCor is here.	0
Thank you, thank you – head of NuCor.	0
That's a big one. Democrats want to raise your taxes, they want to destroy your jobs...	0
[Booing]	0
They want to crush our industries with crippling regulations, and you know the stock market is up almost 40 percent since that great November day.	0
Your 401Ks are doing very well, 401Ks.	0
I tell the story, I was in New York and I shake hands.	0
I love law enforcement – do we love law enforcement?	0
And I was shaking hands with policemen in New York City, and the first one came up to me and said Mr. President, I want to thank you so much.	0
I said what did I do?	0
He said my 401K is up 44 percent and my wife thinks I'm, for the first time, a financial genius.	0
[Laughter]	0
She's giving him all the credit.	0
She said – she said darling, I love you so much and he said yes, I'm a great financial wizard.	0
[Laughter]	0
But he said you're looking – you're just making me look so good, and all of you – who has 401Ks here?	0
I guarantee you one thing, I have your vote.	0
I guarantee it.	0
[Laughter]	0
Of course, if the fake news did a poll, they're called suppression polls.	0
[Booing]	0
You know, polls are fake, just like everything else.	0
[Booing]	0
If the fake news did a poll, it would show that I'm only getting 25 percent with the 401K people, even though they're up 44 percent.	0
No, we got — we're doing well.	0
We're doing well, and I'm happy you're doing well.	0
They just came out with a poll — did you hear?	0
The most popular person in the history of the Republican Party is Trump.	1
Can you believe this?	0
"So I said, ""Does that include honest Abe Lincoln?"""	0
You know, he was pretty good, right?	0
"Remember, I said, when I'd be a little bit wild, and we'd have a lot of fun, they'd say, ""He's not acting presidential,"" and I'd say, ""Well, it's a lot easier to act presidential than to do what I do."""	0
Anybody can act presidential.	0
Ladies and gentlemen of the state of Florida, thank you very much for being here.	0
You are tremendously people, and I will leave now, because I am boring you to death.	0
Thank you.	0
"No, but I said, ""I can be — "" I used to tell them all the time, the fake news, I'd say, ""I can be more presidential than any president in history, except for possibly Abe Lincoln with the big hat."""	0
I — I don't know about that.	0
Abe — Abe looked pretty presidential, right?	0
What do you think?	0
He's tough.	0
He's tough.	0
I admit it: Abe Lincoln is tough.	0
But we love Abe Lincoln.	0
One of these guys, when that poll came out — most popular — and it was in the 90s.	0
And one of these guys is on television.	0
You know, can't miss a word.	0
Can't miss a word.	0
Every — they see the poll.	0
Oh, my God.	0
Oh, my God.	0
Look at this.	0
Oh, my God.	0
Yeah, seven more years, seven more.	0
Seven more.	0
Oh, my God.	0
We've got to find something.	0
We've got to do anything — anything — to get him out.	0
He's doing too well.	0
This is not good.	0
Worst of all, Democrats want to — you know that.	0
They want to open our borders.	0
They want to let crime, tremendous crime into our country.	0
We can't do it.	0
[Booing]	0
Republicans want strong borders and no crime; Democrats want open borders, which equals massive crime.	0
And on top of that, the Democrats — Nancy Pelosi, the whole group, Maxine — Maxine.	0
She likes me a lot.	0
She likes me a lot.	0
[Booing]	0
They've launched outrageous attacks on our incredible law enforcement officers, and on ICE and our Border Patrol, can you believe it?	0
[Booing]	0
People that keep us safe.	0
Their new platform, what they want to do – the Democrat Party, they want to abolish ICE.	0
So in other words, they want to let MS-13 rule our country.	0
That's not going to happen.	0
[Booing]	0
Every day, the brave men and women of ICE are liberating communities and towns from savage gangs like MS-13 that are occupying our country like another nation would.	1
We want maximum border security and respect for our heroes, ICE, Border Patrol and law enforcement.	0
And we're going to have tremendous border security that will include the wall — that will include the wall.	0
Now a lot of people don't know it but we've already started the wall.	0
We got $1.6 billion and we've started large portions of the wall, but we're going to need – even the way we negotiate, we're going to need more and we're going to get more and we may have to do some pretty drastic things, but we're going to get it.	1
Because the Democrats – the Democrats are not voting for what we want to do and they're not voting and allowing our values to take place in our country.	0
[Booing]	0
We're tracking down the gang members and we're tracking down the drug dealers and the child predators and the criminal aliens and we're throwing them in jail or throwing them the hell out of our country.	0
In some states, Democrats are even trying to give illegal immigrants the right to vote.	1
They want to give them the right to vote.	0
[Booing]	0
Yeah, what about all of those people that are waiting in line for 7, 8, 9, 10 years trying to get into our country, they don't have the right to vote.	0
We believe that only American citizens should vote in American elections -- Which is why the time has come for voter ID like everything else, voter ID.	0
You know, if you go out and you want to buy groceries, you need a picture on a card, you need ID.	0
You go out and you want to buy anything, you need ID and you need your picture.	0
In this country, the only time you don't need it in many cases is when you want to vote for a president, when you want to vote for a senator, when you want to vote for a governor or a congressman, it's crazy, it's crazy.	0
[Booing]	0
But we're turning it around.	0
Remember I said it's awfully early to be thinking this, but I always think it, remember the attack on Merry Christmas, they're not attacking it anymore.	0
Everyone is happy to say Merry Christmas, right?	0
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas.	0
That was under siege.	0
"You have these big department stores they say, ""Happy Holidays."""	0
"I say, ""Where is the Merry Christmas?"""	0
Now they're all putting up Merry Christmas again and that's because — only because of our campaign.	0
And by the way, the evangelicals and Paula White, Pastor Paula White, the evangelicals have been so amazing to us.	0
They came out and they voted 84 percent and doubled and tripled the numbers that ever voted in an election before.	0
We love the evangelical Christians.	0
If you want safety, if you want borders, if you want to have a country, then you need to go out and vote Republican.	0
And very importantly, you need to go out and vote for Ron DeSantis for governor of Florida.	0
The lobbyists and special interests fighting against my administration, many of them are globalist.	0
They care what happens in other countries.	0
I care what's happening in the USA.	0
[Audience chants]	0
They're the geniuses who came up with our terrible trade deals one after another, how about NAFTA, remember when they signed NAFTA?	0
[Booing]	0
"Remember they signed NAFTA and everybody just moved their companies down to Mexico and these people were saying, ""Isn't that a wonderful thing?"""	0
No, it's not a wonderful thing and those companies are now moving back.	0
These are the people who lost trillions of dollars overseas and who gave us our horrible immigration laws.	0
These laws are the worst.	0
I am for America first and the American worker.	0
We want to be a puppet for no one any longer.	0
We're not going to be a puppet any longer.	0
My only special interest is you, the citizens of the United States.	0
I've had a great career.	0
I've got a lot of fun, even in Florida, I've had a great career, I've had a lot of fun.	0
I've done great.	0
I've done really well, beyond anything I could've ever expected.	0
And then I ran for president with no experience and I won.	0
Isn't that -- But you actually won.	0
You know, I told the story the other day, I was probably in Washington in my entire life 17 times.	0
True, 17 times.	0
I don't think I ever stayed overnight.	0
You know what I'm getting at, right?	0
And we have a great cabinet now, a couple of little changes.	0
But we have a great cabinet.	0
We have — Mike Pompeo, our Secretary of State.	0
So many great people.	0
And we're really getting – we have just incredible people.	0
But I made some choices that I wouldn't have made.	0
But I'm riding down Pennsylvania Avenue.	0
Again, I've only been here about 17 times.	0
And probably seven of those times was to check out the hotel I'm building on Pennsylvania Avenue and then I hop on the plane and I go back.	0
So I've been there 17 times, never stayed there at night.	0
I don't believe.	0
And then I'm riding down in this beautiful car, picked up at the airport by Secret Service, holding the hand of our great first lady.	0
"And I look at her and I say, ""Honey, guess what, I'm president of the United States!"""	0
President of the United States.	0
And I didn't know anybody in Washington, but now I know everybody in Washington.	0
I know the good ones.	0
I know the bad ones.	0
I know the wonderful people and I know the scum.	0
And America now is winning again like they haven't won before.	0
We passed the biggest tax cuts and reform in American history, biggest cuts in history.	1
More than 100 utilities have slashed rates for consumers including right here from Duke Energy and Tampa Electric.	0
Your rates have gone down.	0
Over $300 billion poured back into the United States in the first quarter, and we expect to be taking back because of our new tax cut and reform plan that passed bigger than anything ever in our country.	0
We expect to be taking back from overseas over $4 trillion.	0
That's a lot of money — could never have come back before.	0
And if our opponent had won and the Democrats had won, they would've put more regulations on.	0
They would've raised your taxes.	0
They would've opened your borders, gotten rid of law enforcement.	0
They would not have helped your military.	0
And you know what?	0
Our country would be going to hell.	0
And instead of going up, the market would be half of what it was if we're lucky, because frankly the tax cuts were incredible to what we've done.	0
But maybe even more important are the cuts in these horrible regulations that didn't allow anybody to do anything, job-killing regulations.	0
We've gotten rid of more regulations than any president in the history of the United States.	0
And that's done in less than two years.	0
I withdrew the United States from the unfair one-sided very, very expensive job-killing Paris Climate Accord.	0
We repealed the core of Obamacare.	0
The individual mandate is gone.	0
You know, the individual mandate.	0
That's a beauty.	0
Only the past administration could have come up with this.	0
That's where you pay a lot of money for the privilege of not paying in order to have poor health care.	0
Other than that, it's a wonderful thing.	0
So you pay all this money for the privilege of not having to pay and the health care is no good to start off with.	0
And we're doing great on health care.	0
We're allowing Americans to buy better health care for less money through association health plans, including across state lines, bidding, you're getting tremendous competition.	0
We passed the biggest VA reform in half a century, Veteran's Choice.	0
If our veterans can't get the care they need from the VA, they will have the right to go see a private doctor.	0
We'll pay for the doctor.	0
And frankly, we'll save a lot of money.	0
We'll help a lot of vets.	0
Everybody said they've been trying to get it for 45 years, everybody said you can't get it.	0
Think of it.	0
Think of it.	0
Veterans Choice, they have to stand – our great people.	0
These are our great people.	0
Who's a veteran in this audience?	0
Do you like Trump?	0
Do you like the job we're doing?	0
Now, think of it, 45 years, everybody said you'll never get it passed.	0
"And I used to say before I really was well-versed on the veteran situation in health care, I used to say all the time, ""Why don't they just let the folks go to a doctor?"""	0
They'd wait in line for 7 days, 9 days, 14 days, 21 days.	0
Some of them started off with a very modest problem.	0
They end up being terminal because they can't see a doctor.	0
"I said, ""Why don't they just let them go see a local private doctor, pay the bill and take care of it?"""	0
It will be a lot less expensive.	0
And it's turned out to be something that the veterans love.	0
And it's passed.	0
It's passed.	0
They've been trying to get it passed for 38 years.	0
The other one is 45, and that's VA accountability.	0
If somebody treated our veterans badly, if they stole, if they was – if they were – you know this, if they were sadistic, if they were really bad to our vets, all right?	0
Really, really bad, we couldn't do anything about it.	0
They could steal.	0
They could rob.	0
They could be abusive.	0
"You couldn't say, ""You're fired."""	0
"Now you can say, ""You're fired."""	0
Made a big difference.	0
That was another one they said you'll never get it done between civil service and unions.	0
We love them both.	0
"But between civil service and unions they said, ""You'll never get it done."	0
"You'll never get it approved."""	0
And by the way, we had virtually no help, very little from Democrats.	0
Very little.	0
Not because it's not right, but because they don't want to give Trump any victory.	0
They'll do everything that's wrong.	0
Look at Judge Kavanaugh.	0
This is a great, great highly respected man.	0
And the good news is the Republicans, I believe, are close to a hundred percent, which is what we need.	0
But so far, the Democrats haven't given us any votes, and that's because they will do anything they can to not help the Trump agenda, even though they know it's wrong.	0
[Booing]	0
And Brett Kavanaugh, highest education, best grades, best tests, best everything.	0
They thought 15 years ago he was going to be a Supreme Court judge.	0
Look at Justice Gorsuch, how good is he?	0
How good is he?	0
So we're getting them through.	0
But it's not easy because they really are.	0
"You know, their term that they use is, ""resist."""	0
It's actually resist and obstruct.	0
Whatever they can do to resist and obstruct.	0
And frankly, they're lousy politicians.	0
They have horrible policy.	0
The one thing they're good at, they stick together and they obstruct.	0
And it's unfortunate.	0
You know, we have almost 400 people trying to get into government, many of whom have left their jobs and the Democrats are holding them up with maximum delay.	0
They're holding them up, not allowing these great people to serve their country.	0
It's a disgrace.	0
That's Chuck Schumer, and it's a disgrace.	0
It's a disgrace.	0
But we'll get that Supreme Court judge, and that's the big one.	0
That's the big one.	0
Really important for those who love our military, we have secured a record $700 billion for our military with another $716 billion next year all approved.	0
And this is great news for the incredible patriots at MacDill Air Force Base, the proud home of the Sixth Air Mobility Wing U.S. Central Command and Special Operations Command.	0
Come on!	0
We're adding nearly 30,000 new soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and we have secured the largest pay raise for our great warriors in a decade.	0
I've also directed the Pentagon to begin the process of creating the sixth branch of our military, the space force – building the space force.	0
And we're doing well in North Korea, although I happen to think that we're doing so well with China that China maybe is getting in our way.	0
But we're going to figure that one out before you can even think about it.	0
But we're doing well in North Korea.	0
We have our – as you know, we have our hostages back.	0
There's been no nuclear testing.	0
There's been no missiles or rockets flying beautifully over Japan.	0
I think our relationship is very good with Chairman Kim, and we'll all see how it all works out.	0
But there's nothing like talking, and we'll see how it is.	0
You remember when I first took office?	0
It really looked like big trouble.	0
In the past administration, they thought that was by far their biggest problem.	0
So I think it's going to work out very well.	0
But a lot of good things are happening.	0
No tests.	0
No rockets flying.	0
But we'll see what happens.	0
And our Vice President, Mike Pence, is going to Hawaii to bring back the remains and to greet the families of our great heroes who gave their lives in Korea.	0
Our fallen warriors are finally coming home to lay at rest in American soil.	0
[Audience Chanting]	0
I also withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided, $150 billion was paid — $1.8 billion in cash.	0
The Iran nuclear deal, it's a horror show.	0
I hope it works out well with Iran, they're having a lot of difficulty right now.	0
I hope it works out well.	0
And I have a feeling they'll be talking to us pretty soon.	0
And maybe not and that's okay too.	0
In December, I recognized Israel's true capital, Jerusalem.	0
And in about five months we opened already the American embassy in Jerusalem.	0
And people had that scheduled for anywhere from five to ten years and you all know the story.	0
We took an existing building.	0
We played around with it.	0
We renovated it.	0
We fixed it up.	0
We use Jerusalem stone, one of the finest stones actually in the world, Jerusalem stone.	0
So, instead of spending 1 billion and the papers were right in front of me – sir, would you please approve this?	0
What is it?	0
This is for the embassy in Israel, American, sir.	0
"I said, ""How much?"""	0
$1 billion, Sir.	0
1 billion!	0
I immediately called our great ambassador to Israel, David Friedman — very successful man, great lawyer, one of the most successful lawyers in the country before he decided to do what he's doing.	0
"I said, ""David, they want us to pay a billion dollars for the embassy."	0
"I don't want to pay a billion dollars."""	0
"I said, ""Study it – do you have any buildings that we own?"""	0
We own so much we don't even know what the hell we own.	0
Find some building in a great location.	0
Call me back.	0
Called me back two days later.	0
"He said, ""Mr. President, Sir, we own the best site in Jerusalem."	0
It's big.	0
It's beautiful and it's got a building on it.	0
I can take that building and renovate it.	0
"I can do it for $140,000."""	0
"I said, ""David, how good is the site?"""	0
We could never buy a better site.	0
They were willing to spend tens of millions for a site.	0
They wanted to buy a site which was so bad.	0
It was totally inferior to what we already had.	0
Don't forget, we get there first, right?	0
You know, we have good sites.	0
"And I said, ""David, do me a favor, don't make it $140,000."	0
Sounds too cheap.	0
Make it like 400,000.	0
"That's okay too, David."""	0
So we saved almost a billion dollars.	0
I could tell you these stories all day long, airplane purchases.	0
I could tell you all day long.	0
And we started working – and for $400,000, we actually have a very beautiful American Embassy in Jerusalem — really beautiful.	0
Now, that's one I guarantee no other president is doing.	0
Can you imagine crooked Hillary doing that?	0
Can you, honestly?	0
Can you imagine?	0
[Booing, Audience chants Lock her up]	0
In all fairness — in all fairness to her, could you imagine anybody else doing that?	0
Nobody else.	0
Nobody else is going to do that.	0
And I could tell you stories about what we've saved with purchases of military equipment, General Mattis would be glad to tell you — but he can't believe it.	0
And some of the generals have said they've never seen anything like it in the world — they've never seen.	0
Because I want that $700 billion properly spent.	0
If we can buy twice the number of aircraft or have a lot of money left over that's what we want.	0
Instead of apologizing for America we're standing up for America.	0
We're standing up for the heroes who protect America and, yes, we are proudly standing up for our great national anthem.	0
[Audience chants USA]	0
With every promise we keep, every record we break, every factory we open, we are restoring American strength and American pride.	0
But to continue this incredible moment of this incredible movement — and that's what we have, we have a movement.	0
This may be, in fact it probably is, the greatest movement in the history of our country.	0
Even they will say that.	0
Even they will say that.	0
But to keep it going we need to elect more Republicans.	0
We need more votes.	0
And we need to elect Ron DeSantis as your governor.	0
Got to do it.	0
And I'm telling you, I know him well, he's a great, great guy.	0
He is going to be an incredible governor, I have no doubt — I have no doubt.	0
I don't do these endorsements easily.	0
I don't need to be here but I happen to love this state so it (inaudible).	0
And I don't do them easily.	0
Although, it seems to have an impact.	0
The other day we endorsed a great gentleman from Georgia.	0
He was probably five points down.	0
He won the election by 40 points.	0
He got 70 percent of the vote — the 30 (ph), think of that.	0
Great guy.	0
And many others.	0
I mean, we could go over one after another, after — they're actually starting to give us credit for this.	0
I don't think there's ever been anything like it.	0
That's why I had to be here to formally — you know, I've been endorsing Ron, I've been saying great things but I wanted to be here to formally endorse Ron, you got to get out and vote.	0
Thank you, Ms. DeSantis, thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
Beautiful family.	0
Get your friends, get your colleagues, get your neighbors and get out and vote in November.	0
You've got to do it because, remember, we're going to win this primary but don't take any chances.	0
Nice lead — nice lead.	0
Don't take any chances.	0
And then about, give yourself about 10,15 minutes of happiness and then go back to work for November.	0
Because we have to remember they're putting up — I know some of the candidates, these are people that don't care about stopping crime.	0
These are people that don't care about people pouring into our country when they shouldn't be here.	0
They don't care about stopping drugs from poisoning our youth and pouring over the border, they don't care.	0
[Booing]	0
Your future governor cares.	0
And your current governor cares, Rick Scott.	0
Loyal citizens like you, incredible people from the great state of Florida helped build this country.	0
And, together, we are taking back our country.	0
We are returning power to where it belongs, the American people.	0
This state was settled by pioneers and visionaries who explored the marshes and raised up cities right on the sea.	0
This state was built by red-blooded American patriots who opened the force Naval Air Station at Pensacola and launched the first brave Americans soaring into the heavens.	0
We stand on the shoulders of generations of proud Americans who knew how to work, knew how to fight, and knew how to win.	0
Win.	0
And you know, when you elect Ron DeSantis as your governor — because you see it already, we're winning so much.	0
Some people are getting a little tired of winning, right?	0
Well, by then it will be another year and two years and three years and you'll be insisting, Governor DeSantis, please see our president, it's too much winning.	0
We can't — we can't stand it.	0
The people of Florida, we can't stand it.	0
Because under previous administrations we never won.	0
We got used to never winning.	0
And he's going to come to me, in Washington, in the Oval office — the beautiful Oval Office — and he's going to say, Mr. President, the people of Florida are just down-right tired of winning, they can't stand it.	0
[Booing]	0
It's just too much, Mr. President.	0
The economy is too good.	0
The jobs are too strong.	0
We're doing too well, is there anything you can do?	0
"I'm going to say, ""Ron, I don't care what you say, we're going to keep on winning."""	0
We're going to keep on winning.	0
We're going to win so much and the people of Florida actually love, don't they?	0
They love it.	0
Remember what I said right at the beginning, we're respected again.	0
And that man is respected and always has been.	0
We will never give up.	0
We will never give in.	0
We will never, ever back down and we will never, ever surrender.	0
Because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue.	0
We are one people.	0
We are one family.	0
And we are one glorious nation under god.	0
And together we will make America wealthy again.	0
We will make America strong again.	0
We will make America safe again.	0
And we will make America great again!	0
Thank you Florida!	0
Thank you.	0
Well, thank you very much, everybody.	0
We appreciate it.	0
We're getting ready to go back.	0
We had a tremendous 24 hours.	0
We've had a tremendous three months, actually, because this has been going on for quite a while.	0
That was a tape that we gave to Chairman Kim and his people, his representatives.	0
And it captures a lot.	0
It captures what could be done.	0
And that's a great -- a great place.	0
It has the potential to be an incredible place.	0
Between South Korea -- if you think about it -- and China, it's got tremendous potential.	0
And I think he understands that and he wants to do what's right.	0
It's my honor today to address the people of the world, following this very historic summit with Chairman Kim Jong Un of North Korea.	0
We spent very intensive hours together, and I think most of you have gotten the signed document, or you will very shortly.	0
It's very comprehensive.	0
It's going to happen.	0
I stand before you as an emissary of the American people to deliver a message of hope and vision, and a message of peace.	0
Let me begin by thanking our incredible hosts in Singapore, especially Prime Minister Lee, a friend of mine.	0
This is a country of profound grace and beauty, and we send our warmest wishes to every citizen of Singapore, who really made this visit so important and so pleasant, despite all of the work and all of the long hours.	0
I also want to thank President Moon of South Korea.	0
He's working hard.	0
In fact, I'll be speaking to him right after we're finished.	0
Prime Minister Abe of Japan -- a friend of mine -- just left our country, and he wants what's right for Japan and for the world.	0
He's a good man.	0
And a very special person, President Xi of China, who has really closed up that border -- maybe a little bit less so over the last couple of months, but that's okay.	0
But he really has.	0
And he's a terrific person and a friend of mine, and really a great leader of his people.	0
I want to thank them for their efforts to help us get to this very historic day.	0
Most importantly, I want to thank Chairman Kim for taking the first bold step toward a bright new future for his people.	0
Our unprecedented meeting -- the first between an American President and a leader of North Korea -- proves that real change is indeed possible.	0
My meeting with Chairman Kim was honest, direct, and productive.	0
We got to know each other well in a very confined period of time, under very strong, strong circumstance.	0
We're prepared to start a new history and we're ready to write a new chapter between our nations.	0
Nearly 70 years ago -- think of that; 70 years ago -- an extremely bloody conflict ravaged the Korean Peninsula.	0
Countless people died in the conflict, including tens of thousands of brave Americans.	0
Yet, while the armistice was agreed to, the war never ended.	0
To this day, never ended.	0
But now we can all have hope that it will soon end.	0
And it will.	0
It will soon end.	0
The past does not have to define the future.	0
Yesterday's conflict does not have to be tomorrow's war.	0
And as history has proven over and over again, adversaries can indeed become friends.	0
We can honor the sacrifice of our forefathers by replacing the horrors of battle with the blessings of peace.	0
And that's what we're doing and that's what we have done.	0
There is no limit to what North Korea can achieve when it gives up its nuclear weapons and embraces commerce and engagement with the rest of the world -- that really wants to engage.	0
Chairman Kim has before him an opportunity like no other: to be remembered as the leader who ushered in a glorious new era of security and prosperity for his people.	0
"Chairman Kim and I just signed a joint statement in which he reaffirmed his ""unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."""	0
We also agreed to vigorous negotiations to implement the agreement as soon as possible.	0
And he wants to do that.	0
This isn't the past.	0
This isn't another administration that never got it started and therefore never got it done.	0
Chairman Kim has told me that North Korea is already destroying a major missile engine testing site.	0
That's not in your signed document; we agreed to that after the agreement was signed.	0
That's a big thing -- for the missiles that they were testing, the site is going to be destroyed very soon.	0
Today is the beginning of an arduous process.	0
Our eyes are wide open, but peace is always worth the effort, especially in this case.	0
This should have been done years ago.	0
This should have been resolved a long time ago, but we're resolving it now.	0
Chairman Kim has the chance to seize an incredible future for his people.	0
Anyone can make war, but only the most courageous can make peace.	0
The current state of affairs cannot endure forever.	0
The people of Korea -- North and South -- are profoundly talented, industrious, and gifted.	0
These are truly gifted people.	0
They share the same heritage, language, customs, culture, and destiny.	0
But to realize their amazing destiny, to reunite their national family, the menace of nuclear weapons will now be removed.	0
In the meantime, the sanctions will remain in effect.	0
We dream of a future where all Koreans can live together in harmony, where families are reunited and hopes are reborn, and where the light of peace chases away the darkness of war.	0
This bright future is within -- and this is what's happening.	0
It is right there.	0
It's within our reach.	0
It's going to be there.	0
It's going to happen.	0
People thought this could never take place.	0
It is now taking place.	0
It's a very great day.	0
It's a very great moment in the history of the world.	0
And Chairman Kim is on his way back to North Korea.	0
And I know for a fact, as soon as he arrives, he's going to start a process that's going to make a lot of people very happy and very safe.	0
So it's an honor to be with everybody today.	0
The media -- this is a big gathering of media, I will say.	0
It makes me feel very uncomfortable.	0
[Laughter]	0
But it is what it is.	0
People understand that this is something very important to all of us, including yourselves and your families.	0
So thank you very much for being here.	0
We'll take some questions.	0
Wow.	0
That's a lot of questions.	0
Go ahead.	0
Sure, go ahead.	0
NBC.	0
Thank you, Mr. President.	0
Two questions for you, if you don't mind.	0
First, the man you met today, Kim Jong Un, as you know, has killed family members, has starved his own people, is responsible for the death of Otto Warmbier.	0
"Why are you so comfortable calling him ""very talented""?"	0
Well, he is very talented.	0
Anybody that takes over a situation like he did, at 26 years of age, and is able to run it, and run it tough -- I don't say he was nice or I don't say anything about it -- he ran it.	0
Very few people, at that age -- you can take one out of ten thousand, probably, couldn't do it.	0
Otto Warmbier is a very special person, and he will be for a long time, in my life.	0
His parents are good friends of mine.	0
I think, without Otto, this would not have happened.	0
Something happened, from that day.	0
It was a terrible thing.	0
It was brutal.	0
But a lot of people started to focus on what was going on, including North Korea.	0
I really think that Otto is someone who did not die in vain.	0
I told this to his parents.	0
Special young man.	0
And I have to say, special parents, special people.	0
Otto did not die in vain.	0
He had a lot to do with us being here today.	0
Okay?	0
Thank you very much.	0
Mr. President, that second question for you, sir, was on the security -- the second question, sir --	0
Go ahead.	0
-- on the security assurances you talked about in your statement.	0
Can you be specific about what assurances you are willing to give to Kim Jong Un?	0
Does that include reducing military capabilities?	0
No.	0
And just to follow up on your answer --	0
No, we're not reducing anything.	0
We're not reducing.	0
At some point, I have to be honest -- and I used to say this during my campaign, as you know, probably, better than most -- I want to get our soldiers out.	0
I want to bring our soldiers back home.	0
We have, right now, 32,000 soldiers in South Korea, and I'd like to be able to bring them back home.	0
But that's not part of the equation right now.	0
At some point, I hope it will be, but not right now.	0
We will be stopping the war games, which will save us a tremendous amount of money, unless and until we see the future negotiation is not going along like it should.	0
But we'll be saving a tremendous amount of money.	0
Plus, I think it's very provocative.	0
Yes, John.	0
Yes, John, go ahead.	0
Oh, go ahead.	0
I'm sorry, I thought you were John Roberts.	0
I looked at you, you just like --	0
It's all right.	0
Much better, right?	0
Frequently -- we're frequently confused, Mr. President.	0
Yes.	0
Mr. President, this joint statement does not talk about verifiable or irreversible denuclearization.	0
Yeah.	0
Was that a concession on the part of the United States?	0
No, not at all.	0
Because if you look at it, I mean, it said we are going to -- let's see here -- it will be gone.	0
"I don't think you can be anymore plain than what we're asking -- ""issues related to the establishment of the new U.S. DPRK relations"" -- the building."	0
"We talk about the guarantees, and we talk about ""unwavering commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."""	0
This is the document that we just signed.	0
Did you discuss with Chairman Kim methods to verify, either with the United States or international organizations, that very process?	0
And do you have a timetable --	0
Yes, we did.	0
Yes, we did.	0
And we'll be verifying.	0
Can you give that to us?	0
Yeah, we'll be verifying.	0
It will be verified.	0
How is that going to be achieved, Mr. President?	0
Well, it's going to be achieved by having a lot of people there, and as we develop a certain trust.	0
And we think we have done that.	0
Secretary Pompeo has been really doing a fantastic job -- his staff, everybody.	0
As we do that, we're going to have a lot of people there, and we're going to be working with them on a lot of other things.	0
But this is complete denuclearization of North Korea, and it will be verified.	0
Will those people be Americans or international --	0
Uh, combinations of both.	0
Combinations of both.	0
And we have talked about it, yes.	0
Yeah, go ahead.	0
Be nice.	0
Be respectful.	0
I'll be very respectful, sir.	0
What did Kim Jong Un say to you to give you the confidence that, for once in the history of North Korea, they are not cheating the system, and gaming the world, and gaming the people who will have to go in and make sure that they're actually giving up their nuclear arsenal?	0
What did he say to you?	0
Yeah, I mean, very fair question.	0
He actually mentioned the fact that they proceeded down a path in the past, and, ultimately, as you know, nothing got done.	0
In one case, they took billions of dollars -- during the Clinton regime -- took billions of dollars and nothing happened.	0
That was a terrible thing, and he actually brought it up to me.	0
And he said we have never gone this far.	0
I don't think they've ever had the confidence, frankly, in a President that they have right now for getting things done and having the ability to get things done.	0
And he was very firm in the fact that he wants to do this.	0
I think he might want to do this as much or even more than me because they see a very bright future for North Korea.	0
So you never know.	0
Right?	0
We never know.	0
But I'll tell you what, we signed a very comprehensive document today, and I think most of you have been given that document.	0
But we signed a very, very comprehensive document, and I believe he's going to live up to that document.	0
In fact, when he lands -- which is going to be shortly -- I think that he will start that process right away.	0
Do you trust him, Mr. President?	0
I do.	0
I do.	0
I can only say that I know him for -- really well, it's been very rhetorical, as you know.	0
I think, without the rhetoric, it wouldn't have happened.	0
I think without other things going along -- I think the establishment of a new team was very important.	0
We have a great team.	0
But I do, I think he wants to get it done.	0
I really feel that very strongly.	0
Oh, there's John.	0
I think -- you know, you two guys look alike when the light is right on the -- the hair is very similar.	0
Let me see, who has better hair?	0
He's got pretty good hair, John, I hate to --	0
It's the angelic glow of the backlighting, Mr. President, that makes us look so similar.	0
Of course, the denuclearization -- nuclear weapons and biological weapons and whatnot -- is one problem in North Korea.	0
Another huge problem is the horrible record that they have on human rights.	0
Was that discussed at all?	0
Yes.	0
Is that something that you will tackle in the future?	0
Yes, it was discussed.	0
It will be discussed more in the future -- human rights.	0
What was also discussed in great detail, John, was that fact that, you know, we have -- and I must have had just countless calls and letters and tweets, anything you can do -- they want the remains of their sons back.	0
They want the remains of their fathers, and mothers, and all of the people that got caught into that really brutal war, which took place, to a large extent, in North Korea.	0
And I asked for it today, and we got it.	0
That was a very last minute.	0
The remains will be coming back.	0
They're going to start that process immediately.	0
"But so many people, even during the campaign, they'd say, ""Is there any way you can work with North Korea to get the remains of my son back or my father back?"""	0
So many people asked me this question.	0
"And, you know, I said, ""Look, we don't get along too well with that particular group of people."""	0
But now we do.	0
And he agreed to that so quickly and so nice -- it was really a very nice thing, and he understands it.	0
He understands it.	0
So for the thousands and thousands -- I guess way over 6,000 that we know of, in terms of the remains, they'll be brought back.	0
The POW-MIA issue clearly is a very important one for thousands of Americans.	0
Especially to a lot of people that are --	0
But what do you, President Trump, expect Kim Jong Un to do about the human rights record regarding the North Korean people?	0
Right.	0
It was discussed.	0
It was discussed relatively briefly compared to denuclearization.	0
Well, obviously, that's where we started and where we ended.	0
But they will be doing things, and I think he wants to do things.	0
I think he wants to -- you'd be very surprised.	0
Very smart.	0
Very good negotiator.	0
Wants to do the right thing.	0
You know, he brought up the fact that, in the past, they took dialogue far -- they never went -- they never were like we are.	0
There's never been anything like what's taken place now.	0
But they went down the line.	0
Billions of dollars were given, and you know, the following day the nuclear program continued.	0
But this is a much different time, and this is a much different President, in all fairness.	0
This is very important to me.	0
This is one of the -- perhaps, one of the reasons that I -- one, I campaigned on this issue, as you know very well, John.	0
Okay.	0
Whoever those people are.	0
I cannot see you with all the lights, but you don't look like either of the two.	0
Yeah, go ahead.	0
Sure.	0
Go ahead.	0
Thank you, Mr. President.	0
And first of all, congratulations.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Appreciate it.	0
Can you touch on the issue of a peace treaty?	0
And also, will you travel to Pyongyang anytime soon?	0
Well, at a certain time, I will.	0
I said that will be a day that I look very much forward to, at the appropriate time.	0
And I also will be inviting Chairman Kim, at the appropriate time, to the White House.	0
I think it's really going to be something that will be very important.	0
And he has accepted.	0
I said, at the appropriate time.	0
We want to go a little bit further down the road.	0
But what we signed today was a lot of things included.	0
And then you have things that weren't included that we got after the deal was signed.	0
I've done that before in my life.	0
We didn't put it in the agreement because we didn't have time.	0
And I think most of you have been handed out the agreement or soon will.	0
But I --	0
[Inaudible]	0
Oh, you have not?	0
Okay.	0
Well, if you could have those agreements passed out.	0
We just finished them, just a little while ago.	0
But if you could have the agreements passed out, we'll -- you'll see what we're talking about.	0
Yes, sir.	0
Go ahead.	0
I will second the congratulations, President.	0
Thank you.	0
What part did Japan play?	0
And did the abduction issue come up?	0
Yes.	0
And also, the fate of the Christians?	0
Yes.	0
And the follow-up question is when will you be doing an interview with Japanese TV?	0
Fifty-thousand American troops are in Japan.	0
Congratulations, again.	0
That's true.	0
Fifty-thousand great troops.	0
That's true.	0
Yeah, it did -- abduction.	0
Absolutely.	0
This is Prime Minister Abe's -- one of his, certainly -- other than the whole denuking subject -- certainly his, I would say, his main point.	0
And I brought it up.	0
Absolutely.	0
And they're going to be working on that.	0
It will be -- we didn't put it down in the document, but it will be worked on.	0
[Inaudible]	0
Christians, yes.	0
We are -- brought it up very strongly.	0
You know, Franklin Graham spent -- spent and spends a tremendous amount of time in North Korea.	0
He's got it very close to his heart.	0
It did come up, and things will be happening.	0
Okay?	0
Thank you.	0
Great question.	0
Yes, Jon.	0
Go ahead.	0
Thank you, Mr. President.	0
Thank you, Jon.	0
Returning to the question of human rights, you spoke very powerfully on the issue during your State of the Union Address.	0
You showed that -- you had the defector in the First Lady's box with the crutches, who escaped.	0
And you, at that point, said that North Korea has more brutally oppressed its people than any other regime on Earth.	0
Do you still believe that is the case having sat down with Kim Jong Un?	0
And does he need to change that?	0
Right.	0
Jon, I believe it's a rough situation over there.	0
There's no question about it.	0
And we did discuss it today pretty strongly.	0
I mean, knowing what the main purpose of what we were doing is: denuking.	0
But discussed it at pretty good length.	0
We'll be doing something on it.	0
It's rough.	0
It's rough in a lot of places, by the way.	0
Not just there.	0
But it's rough, and we will continue that.	0
And I think, ultimately, we'll agree to something.	0
But it was discussed at length outside of the nuclear situation, one of the primary topics.	0
But do you think that needs to change to bring on this glorious new era you've talked about?	0
Are they going to have to --	0
I think it will change.	0
Yeah.	0
I think it probably has to, but I think it will.	0
Yeah.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Steve.	0
That's you, Steve?	0
Right there.	0
Yes, sir.	0
Thank you.	0
What timetable do you envision for their denuclearization?	0
And in the meantime, are you thinking about easing any sanctions?	0
Well, you know, scientifically, I've been watching and reading a lot about this, and it does take a long time to pull off complete denuclearization.	0
It takes a long time.	0
Scientifically, you have to wait certain periods of time, and a lot of things happen.	0
But…	0
Having sat down with Kim Jong Un.	0
And does he have to change that?	0
Jon, I believe it's a rough situation over there.	0
There's no question about it.	0
And we did discuss it today pretty strongly.	0
I mean, knowing what -- the main purpose of what we were doing is: denuking.	0
But discussed at pretty good length.	0
We'll be doing something on it.	0
It's rough.	0
It's rough in a lot of places, by the way -- not just there.	0
But it's rough.	0
And we will continue that, and I think, ultimately, we'll agree to something.	0
But it was discussed at length.	0
Outside of -- outside of the nuclear situation, one of the primary topics.	0
But do you think that needs to change to bring on this glorious new era you've talked about?	0
Are they going to have to --	0
I think it will change, yeah.	0
I think it probably has to.	0
But I think it will.	0
Yeah.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Steve?	0
That's you, Steve?	0
Right there.	0
Yes, sir.	0
Thank you.	0
What timetable do you envision for their denuclearization?	0
And in the meantime, are you thinking about easing any sanctions?	0
Well, you know, scientifically, I've been watching and reading a lot about this, and it does take a long time to pull off complete denuclearization.	0
It takes a long time.	0
Scientifically, you have to wait certain periods of time, and a lot of things happen.	0
But despite that, once you start the process, it means it's pretty much over; you can't use them.	0
That's the good news.	0
And that's going to start very -- very soon.	0
I believe that's going to start very soon.	0
We will do it as fast as it can mechanically and physically be done, Steve.	0
And the sanctions?	0
The sanctions will come off when we are sure that the nukes are no longer a factor.	0
Sanctions played a big role, but they'll come off at that point.	0
I hope it's going to be soon, but they'll come off.	0
As you know, and as I've said, the sanctions right now remain.	0
But at a certain point, I actually look forward to taking them off.	0
And they'll come off when we know we're down the road -- where it's not going to happen, nothing is going to happen.	0
Okay?	0
Yes, go ahead.	0
Please.	0
Thank you, Mr. President.	0
Thank you.	0
Congratulations on this historic summit.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Congratulations to everybody, by the way.	0
Congratulations to everybody.	0
Go ahead.	0
You signed a document with Kim Jong Un.	0
It's essentially a piece of paper.	0
Yesterday, we had a briefing from the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.	0
"He said the following: ""Many Presidents previously have signed off on pieces of paper only to find that the North Koreans either didn't promise what we thought they had, or actually reneged on those promises."""	0
What makes this time different, Mr. President?	0
Well, you have a different administration.	0
You have a different President.	0
You have a different Secretary of State.	0
You have people that are -- you know, it's very important to them.	0
And we get it done.	0
The other groups, maybe it wasn't a priority.	0
I don't think they could have done it if it was a priority, frankly.	0
I don't think they honestly could have done it even if it was a priority.	0
And it would have been easier back then.	0
It would have been -- for me, it would have been much easier if this were 10 years ago or 5 years ago.	0
And I'm not just blaming President Obama.	0
I mean, this goes back -- for 25 years, this should have happened.	0
I was given a very tough hand.	0
I was given this, I was given the Iran deal, and plenty of other problems.	0
But we are -- we're doing really well.	0
And the Iran deal, I have to be honest, I did it because nuclear is always number one to me.	0
Nuclear is number one.	0
But on the Iran deal, I think Iran is a different country now than it was three or four months ago.	0
I don't think they're looking so much to the Mediterranean.	0
I don't think they're looking so much at Syria, like they were, with total confidence.	0
I don't think they're so confident right now.	0
But I hope -- with that being said, I hope that, at the appropriate time, after these sanctions kick in -- and they are brutal, what we've put on Iran -- I hope that they're going to come back and negotiate a real deal, because I'd love to be able to do that.	0
But right now, it's too soon for that.	0
Yes, please.	0
Mr. President, you also didn't talk about establishing diplomatic relations, exchanging ambassadors.	0
How long before that happens?	0
Good question.	0
Hopefully soon.	0
But we'll have to get things moving first.	0
Very -- a little bit early for that.	0
We have to get things moving.	0
Yes, go ahead.	0
Hi.	0
"Can you clarify, when you said you were stopping ""war games,"" so you are stopping the military exercises with South Korea?"	0
Yeah, we've done exercises for a long period of time, working with South Korea.	1
"And we call them ""war games,"" and I call them ""war games."""	0
And they're tremendously expensive.	1
The amount of money that we spend on that is incredible.	0
And South Korea contributes, but not 100 percent, which is certainly a subject that we have to talk to them about also.	0
And that has to do with the military expense and also the trade.	0
So we're doing that.	0
We actually have a new deal with South Korea, in terms of the trade deal, but we have to talk to them.	0
We have to talk to many countries about treating us fairly.	0
But the war games are very expensive.	0
We pay for a big majority of them.	0
We fly in bombers from Guam.	0
"I said -- when I first started, I said, ""Where do the bombers come from?"""	0
Guam.	0
Nearby.	0
"I said, ""Oh, great, nearby."	0
"Where's nearby?"""	0
Six and a half hours.	0
Six and a half hours -- that's a long time for these big massive planes to be flying to South Korea to practice and then drop bombs all over the place, and then go back to Guam.	0
I know a lot about airplanes; it's very expensive.	0
And I didn't like it.	0
And what I did say is -- and I think it's very provocative, I have to tell you, Jennifer, it's a very provocative situation when I see that, and you have a country right next door.	0
So under the circumstances that we are negotiating a very comprehensive, complete deal, I think it's inappropriate to be having war games.	0
So, number one, we save money -- a lot.	0
And number two, it really is something that I think they very much appreciate it.	0
Does North Korea give you something in return, though?	0
Well, we've gotten -- you know, I've heard that.	0
I mean, some of the people that -- I don't know, maybe they really mean it.	0
I don't always want to go against the press because I just don't -- especially not today, this is too important.	0
But I noticed that some of the people were saying that the President has agreed to meet, he has given up so much.	0
I gave up nothing.	0
I'm here.	0
I haven't slept in 25 hours, but I thought it was appropriate to do -- because we have been negotiating for literally around the clock with them, and with us, and with John, and with Mike, and a whole team of very talented people.	0
But we haven't given up anything, other than -- you're right, I agreed to meet.	0
And I think the meeting was every bit as good for the United States as it was for North Korea.	0
But I just wrote down some of the things we got.	0
And they -- you know, they -- sure, they got a meeting.	0
But only a person that dislikes Donald Trump would say that I've agreed to make a big commitment.	0
Sure, I've agreed to take a period of time and come here and meet, and that's good.	0
But I think it's great for us, as a country, and I think it's good for them.	0
But what did they do to justify this meeting?	0
Secured commitment for complete denuclearization; that's the big thing.	0
They secured the release of three American hostages.	0
They already gave them to us two months ago.	0
These people are now living happily back in their homes, with their families.	0
And it was pretty rough for them, to put it mildly.	0
Secure the commitment to recover the remains, including -- these are of fallen heroes.	0
And they're giving a commitment, they're starting it immediately, to recover their remains.	0
And I just went through how many people asked me about it.	0
I was amazed, actually.	0
"So many people would ask me, ""Is it possible?"	0
"Is it possible?"""	0
At that time we had no relationship to Chairman Kim or to anybody else in North Korea.	0
You know, it was a very closed society.	0
So we're getting the remains back.	0
Secured the halt of all missile and nuclear tests for -- how long has it been?	0
Seven months?	0
You haven't had a missile go up.	0
For seven months, you haven't had a nuclear test; you haven't had a nuclear explosion.	0
I remember a nuclear event took place -- 8.8 in the Richter scale.	0
And they announced -- I heard it on the radio -- they announced that a massive -- you know, an earthquake took place somewhere in Asia.	0
And then they said it was in North Korea.	0
And then they found out it was a nuclear test.	0
"I said, ""I never heard of a Richter scale in the high 8s."""	0
And if you look, there has been no missile launches.	0
They've blown up their missile area.	0
That's going to take place.	0
That has not been written into the contract.	0
We're going to give you the exact details on that.	0
But they secured a halt of all missiles and of all nuclear tests.	0
They secured the closure of their single primary nuclear test site.	0
All three of them -- they're in an area that's common around each other -- they secured the closure.	0
They secured the commitment to destroy the missile engine testing site.	0
That was not in your agreement.	0
I got that after we signed the agreement.	0
"I said, ""Do me a favor."	0
You've got this missile engine testing site.	0
"We know where it is because of the heat."""	0
It's incredible the equipment we have, to be honest with you.	0
"I said, ""Can you close it up?"""	0
He's going to close it up.	0
We maintained the ability to continue to apply sanctions.	0
So we're applying sanctions.	0
Now I had 300 sanctions that I was getting ready to put on last week.	0
And I said, you know, I can't really put on sanctions when I'm meeting with -- I thought it would be very disrespectful.	0
Three hundred very big ones, powerful ones.	0
And I said it would be disrespectful.	0
So, Jennifer, when you look at all of those things that we got -- and when we got our hostages back, I didn't pay $1.8 billion in cash like the hostages that came back from Iran, which was a disgraceful situation, what took place.	0
So we've gotten a lot.	0
So when I hear somebody in the media say that President Trump has agreed to meet -- like, it's not a big deal to meet.	0
I think we should meet on a lot of different topics, not just this one.	0
And I really believe a lot of great things can happen.	0
Yes.	0
Go ahead, please.	0
Sir, you just listed off a lot of things that you say you got in this meeting.	0
It wasn't too long ago, though, that you said you defined the success of this meeting by North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons.	0
Well, that's what they're doing.	0
Well, can you talk about how --	0
Sure.	0
That's what they're doing.	0
I mean, I don't think the --	0
-- how you pressed Kim Jong Un for complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization?	0
Yeah, I did, honestly --	0
And can you why you didn't secure those details in this agreement?	0
Because there was no time.	0
I'm here one day.	0
We're together for many hours intensively, but the process is now going to take place.	0
And I would be surprised, Mike, if they haven't even started already.	0
They have started; they blew up their sites.	0
They blew up their testing site.	0
But I will say, he knew, prior to coming -- you know, this wasn't like a surprise.	0
It wasn't like we've never discussed it.	0
We discussed it.	0
Mike discussed it very strongly with his counterpart in North Korea.	0
They knew that this was -- let's say they didn't agree to that I couldn't sign any agreement.	0
There was no agreement that could have been signed.	0
So they understood that.	0
And it wasn't a big point today because, really, this had been taken care of, more than any other thing.	0
Because it was all about this.	0
This has been taken care of before we got here.	0
So when we brought that up today, you see the language.	0
It's very strong.	0
It's in the document.	0
Yes, ma'am.	0
Thank you, Mr. President.	0
Could you talk about the military consequences for North Korea if they don't follow through on the commitments that you're talking about?	0
Could there be military action?	0
Well, I don't want to talk.	0
Yeah, I know.	0
That's a tough thing to talk about because I don't want to be threatening.	0
I don't want to be threatening.	0
They understood that.	0
And you've seen what was, perhaps, going to happen.	0
And you know, Seoul has 28 million people.	0
We think we have big cities.	0
You look at New York, where it has 8 million people.	0
We think it's a big city.	0
Seoul has 28 million people.	0
Think of that.	0
And it's right next to the border.	0
It's right next to the DMZ.	0
It's right there.	0
I mean, if this would have happened, I think -- you know, I've heard, oh, a hundred-thousand people.	0
I think you could have lost 20 million people, 30 million people.	0
This is really an honor for me to be doing this because I think, you know, potentially, you could have lost, you know, 30-, 40-, 50 million people.	0
The city of Seoul, one of the biggest cities in the world, is right next to the border.	0
You once spoke about fire and fury.	0
Is that no longer the case?	0
Well, at that time we needed, perhaps, fire and fury.	0
Because we could not have allowed that kind of capability from the standpoint of the United States.	0
And certainly, Japan wasn't going to allow it either.	0
Japan is right next door.	0
One more thing.	0
Mr. President, could you tell us about the video that you showed before this?	0
Yeah.	0
When did you show that to Kim?	0
What was the goal there?	0
Today.	0
Yeah, we had it made up by some -- I hope you liked it.	0
I thought it was good.	0
I thought it was interesting enough to show.	0
One in English and one in Korean.	0
And we had it made up.	0
I showed it to him today.	0
Actually, during the meeting -- toward the end of the meeting.	0
And I think he loved it.	0
They were giving -- we didn't have a big screen like you have the luxury of having.	0
We didn't need it because we had it on a cassette and -- an iPad.	0
And they played it.	0
And about eight of their representatives were watching it, and I thought they were fascinated.	0
But I thought it was well done.	0
I showed it to you because that's the future.	0
I mean, that could very well be the future.	0
And the other alternative is just not a very good alternative.	0
It's just not good.	0
But I showed it because I really want him to do something.	0
Now, I don't think I had to show it because I really believe he wants to -- I think he wants to get it done.	0
Yes.	0
Go ahead.	0
How's Staten Island Ferry doing?	0
Okay?	0
He wrote the best story about me with the Staten Island Ferry.	0
And after that, he's never written a good story.	0
That's a long time ago, sir.	0
I don't know what happened.	0
It's a long time ago.	0
Mr. President, it's been a busy week for you on the international stage.	0
You're leaving this summit here in Singapore having determined that Kim Jong Un is a talented man.	0
You left the G7 Summit a few days ago in Canada having determined that Prime Minister Trudeau is weak and dishonest.	0
What do you say to America's allies who worry that you might be jeopardizing our long-term alliances and who worry that you might be treating our historic friends as enemies and our historic enemies as friends?	0
Well, first of all, I think it's a very fair question.	0
I had a very good meeting with the G7.	0
And I left the meeting.	0
And, I'll be honest, we are being taken advantage of by virtually every one of those countries.	0
Very, very seriously.	0
Now, the United States, because of bad management at the top, because of Presidents that didn't care about trade or didn't understand it or whatever reason.	0
For many years, with China being, obviously, the most successful at it, but the European Union is second -- $151 billion we lost.	0
They were represented at the meeting.	0
And we're being taken advantage of on trade.	0
Canada does have very big advantages over us in terms of trade deficits.	0
We have a big trade deficit with Canada, I was reading, where, oh, it's actually a surplus.	0
Not a surplus.	0
It's either 17, but it could actually be 100.	0
You know, they put out a document.	0
I don't know if you saw it.	0
They didn't want me to see it, but we found it.	0
Perhaps they were trying to show the power they have.	0
It's close to $100 billion a year loss with Canada.	0
They don't take our farm products -- many of them.	0
They charge what was 270 percent, but somebody told me the other day that a few months ago they raised it to 295 percent for dairy products.	0
And it's very unfair to our farmers, and it's very unfair to the people of our country -- the workers, the farmers, the companies.	0
And we are not able to trade.	0
They have tremendous barriers up.	0
They have tremendous tariffs.	0
"So when I put in a countervailing tariff just to get us up a little bit so the balance isn't so much -- it's like this -- they said, ""Oh, that's so terrible."""	0
"I said, ""What's terrible?"""	0
We have to catch you a little bit.	0
We have to have a little balance.	0
Even if it's not complete, we have to have a little balance.	0
I say this with many countries.	0
Anyway, we came -- we finished the meeting.	0
Really, everybody was happy.	0
And I agreed to sign something.	0
I asked for changes; I demanded changes.	0
And those changes were made.	0
In fact, the picture with Angela Merkel, who I get along with very well, where I'm sitting there like this, that picture was we're waiting for the document because I wanted to see the final document as changed by the changes that I requested.	0
That was a very friendly -- I know it didn't look friendly, and I know it was reported like sort of nasty both ways.	0
I was angry at her or she -- actually, we were just talking, the whole group, about something unrelated to everything, very friendly, waiting for the document to come back so I could read it before I leave.	0
Anyway, I left and it was very friendly.	0
When I got onto the plane, I think that Justin probably didn't know that Air Force One has about 20 televisions, and I see the television.	0
And he's giving a news conference about how he will not be pushed around by the United States.	0
And I say, push him around?	0
We just shook hands.	0
It was very friendly.	0
Look, countries cannot continue to take advantage of us on trade.	0
The number are out.	0
Over the last couple of years, and over the last many years -- but over the last couple of years, this country has lost $800 billion on trade with other countries, the biggest one being China.	0
Eight-hundred billion dollars.	0
A hundred fifty-one billion with the European Union.	0
They don't take our agricultural products, barely.	0
They don't take a lot of what we have, and yet they send Mercedes into us, they send BMWs into us by the millions.	0
It's very unfair, and it's very unfair to our workers.	0
And I'm going to straighten it out.	0
And it won't even be tough.	0
Okay?	0
Thank you.	0
Go ahead.	0
Go ahead.	0
[Inaudible]	0
I would like to involve Congress, yes.	0
And no, I have a good relationship with Justin Trudeau.	0
I really did.	0
Other than he had a news conference that he had because he assumed I was in an airplane and I wasn't watching.	0
He learned.	0
That's going to cost a lot of money for the people of Canada.	0
He learned.	0
You can't do that.	0
You can't do that.	0
We laughed.	0
We had a very good relationship.	0
I've had a good relationship with Justin.	0
I have a good relationship with all.	0
I have a very good relationship with Angela Merkel.	0
But on NATO, we're paying 4.2 percent; she's paying 1 percent of a much smaller GDP than we have.	0
We're paying 4.2 percent on a much larger -- we're paying for -- I mean, anyone can say -- from 60 to 90 percent of NATO.	0
And we're protecting countries of Europe.	0
And then on top of it, they kill us on trade.	0
So we just can't have it that way.	0
It's unfair to our taxpayers and to our people.	0
But no, I have a good relationship with Justin.	0
And I have a, I think, a very good relationship with Chairman Kim right now.	0
I really do.	0
I think -- I hope it's good because if it is, we're going to solve a very big problem.	0
I think we've gone a long way to solving it today.	0
Should we keep going for a little while?	0
Sarah?	0
I don't know.	0
It's up to the legendary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.	0
Should we keep going, Sarah?	0
Okay, we'll go.	0
Well, I don't care.	0
Hey, you know, it just means we get home a little later in the evening.	0
Right?	0
Yeah.	0
Go ahead.	0
Sure.	0
Go ahead.	0
Go ahead.	0
Hi, Mr. President.	0
How are you?	0
I'm good.	0
Nice to see you.	0
From The Straits Times of Singapore.	0
Welcome to the country.	0
Thank you very much.	0
I hope you enjoyed our food.	0
Beautiful country.	0
I did.	0
I just wanted to find out.	0
You described this as a process.	0
What is the immediate next step?	0
Is there some ongoing dialogue --	0
Yes.	0
We're getting together next week to go into the details. And that's	0
[inaudible]	0
?	0
Secretary Pompeo.	0
Yeah.	0
Next week, with John Bolton and our entire team, to go over the details and to get this stuff done.	0
We want to get it done; he wants to get it done.	0
We're also working very much with South Korea.	0
We're working with Japan.	0
We're working with China, to a lesser extent, but we're working with China.	0
And you are coming back to Singapore?	0
I would come back gladly.	0
Your Prime Minister was fantastic.	0
We were with him yesterday.	0
He's done a great job.	0
It was very welcoming.	0
It really, probably had -- it probably made a difference, actually.	0
It's a great place.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Thank you, Mr. President.	0
Yes, ma'am.	0
Thank you, Mr. President.	0
What was it about that first interaction with Chairman Kim this morning that that made you decide not to walk away after you said that you would know within the first minute if he was sincere or not?	0
Yeah.	0
I've said that about relationships.	0
I've said that about people.	0
You know in the first second.	0
Now, I was generous.	0
I said five seconds.	0
But you know in the first second, in some cases.	0
Sometimes that doesn't work out.	0
But sometimes it does.	0
From the beginning, we got along.	0
But there's been a lot of groundwork.	0
This wasn't like we went and we started talking about -- as you know, right?	0
We didn't just come in and start talking about these very complex subjects that have been going on for 70 years.	0
We've been discussing this for months.	0
And, you know, once the rhetoric stopped, once they did a great thing --you know, North Korea did a great thing by going to the Olympics.	0
Because the Olympics -- and President Moon will tell you this -- the Olympics was not exactly doing great.	0
People didn't feel like being bombed out of the Opening Ceremonies.	0
You know, they weren't exactly selling tickets.	0
"And as soon as the Chairman -- Chairman Kim -- said, ""Let's participate in the Olympics,"" it sold like wildfire and was a great success as an Olympics."	0
It was a great success.	0
He did a great thing.	0
But since that time, pretty much since that time -- because, as you know, a delegation came from South Korea who had just met with North Korea.	0
They came to the White House.	0
They told me lots of things, including the fact that they'd be willing to denuke.	0
We have one of their great people here today.	0
That they were willing to denuke.	0
And once that started, we have been really talking about that from the end of the Olympics when the whole delegation came to say various things, including denuking.	0
If I may, a second question.	0
In the document that you signed earlier today, North Korea agreed to commit to denuclearization.	0
To borrow a phrase that you have used to criticize your predecessors and political opponents, how do you ensure that North Korea is not all talk, no action going forward?	0
Well, I think can you ensure anything?	0
Can I ensure that you're going to be able to sit down properly when you sit down?	0
I mean, you can't ensure anything.	0
All I can say is they want to make a deal.	0
That's what I do.	0
My whole life has been deals.	0
I've done great at it, and that's what I do.	0
And I know when somebody wants to deal, and I know when somebody doesn't.	0
A lot of politicians don't.	0
That's not their thing, but it is my thing.	0
I mean, again, this really could have been done, I think, easier a long time ago.	0
But I know for a -- I just feel very strongly -- my instinct, my ability, or talent -- they want to make a deal.	0
And making a deal is a great thing for the world.	0
It's also a great thing for China because I can't imagine that China has, you know, is happy with somebody having nuclear weapons so close.	0
So, you know, that's -- China was very helpful.	0
So I think he wants to make a deal.	0
Can anybody be certain?	0
But we're going to be certain soon because the negotiations continue.	0
Okay?	0
Thank you very much.	0
Go ahead.	0
You mentioned that you have raised extensively the issue of human rights with Chairman Kim.	0
Yes.	0
I wonder what you would say to the group of people who have no ability whatsoever to hear or to see this press conference -- the 100,000 North Koreans kept in a network of gulags.	0
Have you betrayed them by legitimizing the regime in Pyongyang?	0
No, I think I've helped them because I think things will change.	0
I think I've helped them.	0
There's nothing I can say.	0
All I can do is do what I can do.	0
We have to stop the nuclearization.	0
We have to do other things, and that's a very important thing.	0
So at a certain point, hopefully, you'll be able to ask me a much more positive question or make a statement.	0
But not much I can do right now.	0
At a certain point, I really believe he's going to do things about it.	0
I think they are one of the great winners today, that large group of people that you're talking about.	0
I think, ultimately, they're going to be one of the great winners as a group.	0
Yes, sir.	0
Go ahead.	0
Go ahead.	0
Yeah.	0
Would you ever consider removing the sanctions without significant improvement in the human rights situation?	0
No.	0
I want significant improvement.	0
I want to know that it won't be happening.	0
And again, once you start that process, there will be a point at which, even though you won't be finished for a while because it can't happen scientifically or mechanically, but you're not going to be able to go back.	0
You know, once we reach that point, I'll start to give that very serious thought.	0
Yes.	0
Go ahead.	0
Go ahead.	0
Go ahead.	0
You first.	0
Mr. President, did you also discuss the cost of denuclearization and how North Korea is about to foot the bill while the crippling sanctions remain in place? I'm from	0
[inaudible]	0
News Agency Singapore.	0
Well, I think that South Korea and I think that Japan will help them very greatly.	0
I think they're prepared to help them.	0
They know they're going to have to help them.	0
I think they're going to help them very greatly.	0
We won't have to help them.	0
The United States has been paying a big price in a lot of different places.	0
But South Korea, which obviously is right next door, and Japan, which essentially is next door, they're going to be helping them.	0
And I think they're going to be doing a very generous job and a terrific job.	0
So they will be helping them.	0
Yes, ma'am.	0
Go ahead.	0
Behind.	0
Yes.	0
Thank you, Mr. President.	0
Thank you.	0
I'd like to follow up on Steve's question.	0
He asked you how long it would take to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.	0
You said a long time.	0
What does that mean?	0
Well, I don't know, when you say a long time.	0
I think we will do it as fast as it can be done scientifically, as fast as it can be done mechanically.	0
I don't think -- I mean, I've read horror stories.	0
It's a 15-year process.	0
Okay?	0
Assuming you wanted to do it quickly, I don't believe that.	0
I think whoever wrote that is wrong.	0
But there will be a point at which, when you're 20 percent through, you can't go back.	0
I had an uncle who was a great professor for, I believe, 40 years at MIT.	0
And I used to discuss nuclear with him all the time.	0
He was a great expert.	0
He was a great, brilliant genius.	0
Dr. John Trump at MIT.	0
I think he was there 40 years, I was told.	0
In fact, the head of MIT sent me a book on my uncle.	0
But we used to talk about nuclear.	0
You're talking about a very complex subject.	0
"It's not just like, ""Oh, gee."	0
"Let's get rid of the nukes."""	0
It takes a period of time.	0
But the main period of time that I'm talking is that first period, when you hit a certain point you can't go back.	0
It's very hard to go back.	0
And how long will that take?	0
We don't know, but it will go pretty quickly.	0
Go ahead.	0
Sure.	0
Thanks, Mr. President.	0
I wanted to ask again on the sanctions campaign.	0
Yeah.	0
You alluded at the very beginning that the Chinese are not doing as great a job securing the border as they were before.	0
You expressed some doubts when Kim went to see President Xi.	0
The Russian foreign minister was in Pyongyang and said there shouldn't be any sanctions while these negotiations are under way.	0
And the South Koreans are now talking about restoring some form of trade.	0
So with all of those players appearing to be moving toward eroding sanctions, how can you keep the sanctions regime in place?	0
What leverage do you have on these countries?	0
Well, I think we have a lot of leverage.	0
I think we have tremendous leverage.	0
I do believe that China, despite my relationship with President Xi -- a man who I told you I have great respect for and like, also, a lot.	0
You know, we're having very tough talks on trade.	0
And I think that probably affects China somewhat.	0
But I have to do what I have to do.	0
And I think, over the last two months, the border is more open than it was when we first started.	0
But that is what it is.	0
We have to do it.	0
We have a tremendous deficit in trade, commonly known as a trade deficit.	0
We have a tremendous deficit in trade with China, and we have to do something about it.	0
We can't continue to let that happen.	0
And I think that has had an impact on my relationship, in terms of the border.	0
I don't think it has the relationship -- you know, I don't think it affects my feeling or my relationship to President Xi.	0
But when we first started, we weren't ready to go that route.	0
And as we started preparing and getting ready to do that, I think that's had an impact on, frankly, the border.	0
Which is a shame.	0
But I have to do it.	0
I have no choice.	0
For our country, I have to do it.	0
South Korea will do whatever is necessary to get a deal done.	0
And if that means we can't trade, then I'm not going to trade.	0
They're definitely not going to trade.	0
If they think -- and they would do this with our concurrence -- if they think that they can do some work because we're very far down the line -- we're actually very far.	0
You know, that document, when you read it today, that's far down the line.	0
That's not something that just happened to be put together.	0
This was done over months.	0
And again, the rhetoric was important, and the sanctions were important.	0
I don't even know which one was more important.	0
They were both important.	0
Yeah.	0
Go ahead.	0
Mr. President, David Sanger for The New York Times.	0
I was wondering if you could give us some sense of whether the Chairman Kim told you how many nuclear weapons he believes he's made, whether he's willing to turn those over first, and then whether, in your mind, you need to do more than was done in the Iran deal for actually dismantling the -- both the uranium and the plutonium processes.	0
And whether or not you had a sense that Chairman Kim really understood what that involves and had a timetable in his own mind of shutting that.	0
Well, David, I can tell you he understands.	0
He understands it so well.	0
He understands it better than the people that are doing the work for him.	0
That is an easy one.	0
As far as what he has, it's substantial.	0
Very substantial.	0
The timing will go quickly.	0
I believe you'll see some good action.	0
I mean, as an example, one of the things with the missile site, I think you're probably surprised to hear that -- that was a throw-in at the end, the missile site.	0
But I really believe, David, that it's going to go very quickly.	0
I really believe that it's going to go fast.	0
And it is a very substantial arsenal.	0
There's no question about it.	0
You know, I used to say maybe it's all talk and no action.	0
But we have pretty good intelligence into that.	0
Although, probably less there than any other country.	0
You understand that maybe better than anybody in the room.	0
Probably less there than any other country.	0
But we have enough intelligence to know that what they have is very substantial.	0
This is why, David, I always say that this shouldn't have taken place so late into the process.	0
Wouldn't this have been better if it was 5 years ago or 20 years ago or 15 years ago and we didn't have to worry about not having a successful meeting like today?	0
So -- and I still love my first interview with you, David.	0
I still have that interview, actually.	0
Yeah.	0
Go ahead.	0
Thank you, Mr. President.	0
Thank you.	0
[Inaudible]	0
the second summit -- if there is a second summit with Chairman Kim Jong Un, would it be in Pyongyang or Washington?	0
We haven't set that up.	0
We'll probably need another summit.	0
We'll probably need -- or meeting.	0
We can use a different term.	0
But we'll probably need another one.	0
We'll probably -- I will say this, we're much further along than I would have thought.	0
I did not think we'd be here.	0
I thought -- and I've told people -- I didn't want to build up people's hopes too much.	0
I told people I thought that this would be a successful meeting if we got along, we developed a relationship, and we could have maybe gotten to this point in three or four months from now.	0
But it really happened very quickly.	0
A lot of that was because of the foundation that was, you know, put down before we met.	0
A lot of things happened very fast.	0
We didn't have -- as an example, bringing back the remains.	0
That was not one of the things that was on our agenda today.	0
I brought that up at the very end because so many people have talked to me about it.	0
And I brought it up at the very end.	0
And he was really very gracious.	0
"Instead of saying, ""Well, let's talk about it the next time."""	0
"He said, ""It makes sense."	0
"We will do it."""	0
And he knew -- you know, they know where many of those incredible people are.	0
Where they're buried along roads, along highways, along paths, usually, because our soldiers were moving back and forth and they had to move rapidly.	0
It's very sad.	0
But he knew.	0
And that was brought up at the very end.	0
And you know, it was really great that he was able to do it.	0
A lot of people are going to be very happy about that.	0
Yes.	0
Go ahead, please.	0
Thank you, Mr. President.	0
Thank you.	0
Emerald Robinson, One America News.	0
Congratulations.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you for the nice way you treat us.	0
We appreciate it.	0
Really, it's very good.	0
It's really beautiful what you do.	0
Go ahead.	0
So you --	0
And now I'll probably get this killer question.	0
[Laughs]	0
Well, I do want to talk about the future of North Korea.	0
Yeah.	0
It's all right.	0
Specifically the people are -- Kim Jong Un is saying he's wanting a brighter future with prosperity for his people, yet we know they've lived under oppression.	0
You showed him this video of what the future can be like.	0
But do you have an idea specifically of the model that you would like to go towards?	0
Economically, is he open to more economic freedom?	0
Yeah, it's a good question.	0
So you saw a tape today, and that, I think, was done really well.	0
But that was done at the highest level of future development.	0
I told him, you may not want this.	0
You may want to do a much smaller version of this.	0
I mean, you're going to do something.	0
But you may want to do a smaller version.	0
You may not want that with the trains and the everything.	0
You know, it's super -- everything the top.	0
And maybe you won't want that.	0
It's going to be up to them.	0
It's going to be up to them.	0
It's going to be up to the people what they want.	0
They may not want that.	0
I can understand that too.	0
But that was a version of what could happen, what could take place.	0
As an example, they have great beaches.	0
You see that whenever they're exploding their cannons into the ocean, right?	0
"I said, ""Boy, look at the view."	0
"Wouldn't that make a great condo behind?"""	0
"And I explained, I said, ""You know, instead of doing that, you could have the best hotels in the world right there."""	0
Think of it from a real estate perspective.	0
You have South Korea, you have China, and they own the land in the middle.	0
How bad is that, right?	0
It's great.	0
But I told him, I said, you may not want to do what's there.	0
You may want to do a smaller version of it or -- you know.	0
And that could be.	0
Although, I tell you what -- he looked at that tape, he looked at that iPad, and I'm telling you they really enjoyed it, I believe.	0
Okay?	0
Yeah.	0
Go ahead.	0
A couple more.	0
Okay.	0
We'll do three more.	0
Yeah.	0
Go ahead.	0
Go.	0
Brian Bennett from Time Magazine.	0
Yes.	0
Hi, Brian.	0
Am I on the cover again this week?	0
Boy, have I -- so many covers.	0
It's entirely possible.	0
Huh?	0
I know.	0
That's okay.	0
Do you now see Kim Jong Un as an equal?	0
In what way?	0
You just showed a video that showed you and Kim Jong Un on equal footing in discussing the future of --	0
No.	0
I think that -- I don't view it that way.	0
See, I don't view it that way.	0
I'll do whatever it takes to make the world a safer place.	0
If I have to say I'm sitting on a stage -- I mean, I understand what you're getting at.	0
If I have to say I'm sitting on a stage with Chairman Kim and that's going to get us to save 30 million lives -- could be more than that -- I'm willing to sit on the stage.	0
I'm willing to travel to Singapore very proudly, very gladly.	0
Again, I -- you know, other than the fact that it is taking my time, they have given up a tremendous amount.	0
They've given it up even before.	0
And even add the Olympics to it.	0
You know, you could add the Olympics to the question.	0
They went to the Olympics.	0
They took an Olympics that was going to be a massive failure that maybe wouldn't have even opened, and they made it a tremendous success by agreeing to participate.	0
Add that to the list of things that they've done.	0
So, Brian, if I can save millions of lives by coming here, sitting down, and establishing a relationship with someone who's a very powerful man, who's got firm control of a country, and that country has very powerful nuclear weapons, it's my honor to do it.	0
Are you concerned that the video you just showed could be used by Kim as propaganda to show him as an equal --	0
No, I'm not concerned at all.	0
We can use that video for other countries.	0
Go ahead.	0
Mr. President, in the year 2000, President Clinton got a request by Kim Jong Il.	0
Got impressed?	0
Got a request --	0
Oh.	0
From Kim Jong Il to travel to Pyongyang and meet him.	0
And Clinton refused.	0
He sent Secretary of State Albright.	0
Yeah.	0
He did a great deal.	0
And he spent $3 billion and got nothing.	0
And he started making nuclear weapons a day later.	0
Mr. President, you, on the other hand, got the request and right away went here to meet him.	0
And do you understand those people who say that you gave him the ultimate present -- the legitimacy to a regime who oppress its people without an ongoing process before you, as the U.S. President, as the leader of the free world, meet and shake hands with this leader of North Korea who is perceived to be oppressing brutally his own people?	0
Okay.	0
Good.	0
I think we just answered the question.	0
But do you understand those people?	0
Oh, I understand them much better than you do.	0
Okay.	0
Yeah.	0
Go ahead.	0
Go ahead.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Yes.	0
Mr. President, Eliana Johnson with Politico.	0
Sure.	0
Hi.	0
Hi.	0
You mentioned a couple specific concessions that you got from Kim: the return of remains and the destruction of the nuclear site.	0
And I know you said that was an add-on --	0
And much more.	0
And much more than that.	0
Yeah.	0
I know you said the last thing was an add-on and it wasn't in the agreement, but that he gave you his word.	0
If he doesn't follow through on these things, what are you prepared to do in response?	0
And will you lose faith in this process?	0
No.	0
I think he'll do it.	0
I really believe that.	0
Otherwise, I wouldn't be doing this.	0
I really believe it.	0
And it was really the engine testing site, in addition to all of the other things that they've agreed to do.	0
It was the -- they have a very powerful engine testing site that, again, we're able to see because of the heat that it emits.	0
And, yeah, I'm able to -- I'm very happy.	0
I'll tell you what -- I'm very happy with those two points -- the two points you mentioned.	0
But I think you might be referring to the thing that's not in, which is the engine testing site.	0
I think he's -- I think -- honestly, I think he's going to do these things.	0
I may be wrong.	0
"I mean, I may stand before you in six months and say, ""Hey, I was wrong."""	0
I don't know that I'll ever admit that, but I'll find some kind of an excuse.	0
[Laughter]	0
Okay, one or two.	0
One more.	0
Come on.	0
Yeah, go ahead.	0
Sure.	0
Thank you, Mr. President.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
[Inaudible]	0
with Xinhua Media Group China.	0
I just would like to know, will you call Chinese President Xi when you come back to D.C. to discuss about achievements you made today with Chairman Kim?	0
Yes.	0
I will.	0
And what's your expectation about China's role to accelerate the process to establish a long-term peace mechanism?	0
Well, my expectation about China is that China is a great country with a great leader, and a friend of mine.	0
And I really believe that he's happy that we've made this kind of progress.	0
And I've heard from him.	0
But I will be calling him very shortly.	0
Maybe even before I land.	0
Okay?	0
And I have to say, you know -- and the United States is a great country.	0
And we have set records economically -- over $7 trillion in net worth addition to what we have.	0
And we are almost twice the size, the economy of the United States.	0
Nobody talks about this, because you do hear a lot about China, rightfully so.	0
But the United States, now, is almost twice the size of the economy of China.	0
We have a great country and we're on a correct path.	0
Okay.	0
One more.	0
That will be it.	0
Mr. President, from South Korea.	0
Oh, South Korea?	0
Where's South Korea?	0
I think you deserve -- go ahead.	0
Go.	0
You deserve one.	0
Yes.	0
You deserve one.	0
I've got two questions for you, Mr. President.	0
First, you mentioned earlier that you're going to talk with South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the phone.	0
Yes.	0
What do you plan to discuss with him?	0
I just want to tell him about the meeting.	0
Very successful.	0
And he'll be very much involved in the final negotiation.	0
He's a very, very fine gentleman.	0
Also a friend of mine.	0
And I look forward to speaking.	0
He'll be very happy when he hears about -- I've already sent word to him about what happened.	0
I sent the document to him, actually, and all of the details behind the document.	0
So I'll be talking to him very shortly.	0
If I may ask another question.	0
In signing the peace treaty, do you hope to -- do you plan to work this out with North Korea's Chairman Kim only, or what do you think about the involvement of South Korea and China as the signatories?	0
I'd like to have them involved also.	0
There's a question as to whether or not we're supposed to or whether or not we legally have to.	0
I don't care.	0
I think it would be great to have China involved and also, of course, South Korea.	0
Okay? Is there a transcript of	0
[inaudible]	0
?	0
What? Is there a transcript of	0
[inaudible]	0
?	0
Mike, do they have a transcript?	0
They probably have a rough transcript, which you can give us, if you have one.	0
So that was recorded?	0
No, they didn't record it.	0
I don't think they recorded it.	0
Are there any recordings of it?	0
I wish there were.	0
Because it is interesting stuff.	0
[Inaudible]	0
Say it?	0
[Inaudible]	0
I don't.	0
We probably have some notes or something.	0
But they have, actually, detailed notes, I would imagine.	0
But we had a great conversation.	0
It was a very heart-felt conversation. How do you believe	0
[inaudible]	0
verify --	0
Well, I don't have to verify because I have one of the great memories of all time.	0
So I don't have to.	0
Okay?	0
Okay?	0
What about the previous phone calls you had with Kim Jong Un? You had phone calls	0
[inaudible]	0
.	0
Yeah, but I don't want to discuss it.	0
But we did is we've had numerous discussions.	0
We've had very important relationships established at Mike's level and other levels.	0
In fact, a couple of people are here from, as you know, from North Korea.	0
They're in the room.	0
We have a few people in the back also, in the room.	0
So when we went into this final agreement, very importantly, we really didn't go in cold.	0
We went in with tremendous relationship and tremendous knowledge.	0
And I think that's why we got it done.	0
So I'm going to head back.	0
I don't know about you folks, but it's been a long time since I've taken it easy.	0
So now we can take it a little bit easy, and then the work begins again.	0
And I appreciate everybody being here.	0
I hope we've answered your questions.	0
And thank you very much.	0
And sort of congratulations to everybody, because this is, really -- to me it's a very important event in world history.	0
And to be really true to myself, I have to add, I want to get it completed. ''	0
So Mike, our whole team has to get to work and get it completed.	0
Because otherwise, we've done a good job.	0
But if you don't the ball over the goal line, it doesn't mean enough.	0
Okay?	0
So thank you, and sort of congratulations to everybody in the room.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Appreciate it.	0
Thank you.	0
[Applause]	0
Oh, thank you very much.	0
Thank you very much.	0
And thank you very much also to a man named Matt Schlapp.	0
What a job he's done.	0
And to CPAC -- I actually started quite a while ago at CPAC, and came here -- probably made my first real political speech.	0
And I enjoyed it so much that I came back for a second one, then a third.	0
Then I said, what the hell, let's run for President.	0
Right?	0
But it's wonderful to be back with so many great patriots, old friends, and brave young conservatives.	0
What a future you have.	0
Our movement and our future in our country is unlimited.	0
What we've done together has never been done in the history maybe of beyond of country, maybe in the history of the world.	0
They came from the mountains and the valleys and the cities.	0
They came from all over.	0
"And what we did in 2016 -- the Election, we call it, with a capital ""E"" -- it's never been done before."	0
And we're going to do it, I think, again in 2020, and the numbers are going to be even bigger.	0
[Audience Chants USA]	0
And we all had to endure, as I was running.	0
So you had 17 Republicans, plus me.	0
[Laughter]	0
And I was probably more of a conservative than a Republican.	0
People just didn’t quite understand that.	0
They didn’t understand it.	0
I think now, with what we've done with the judiciary and so many other things, I think they get it very well.	0
And it's driving the other side crazy.	0
But we all had to endure, remember?	0
"How many times did you hear, for months and months, ""There is no way to 270""?"	0
You know what that means, right?	0
There is no way to 270.	0
They couldn’t get me there.	0
We might as well have just given up.	0
But there wasn’t any way to 270.	0
In fact, I actually went up to Maine to get one, and I did win the one.	0
But we didn’t need the one.	0
We didn’t need it.	0
We won Maine.	0
We won our half of Maine, remember?	0
You have Nebraska.	0
We won both in Nebraska.	0
We won the half we had to win in Maine.	0
So we got the one, but we didn’t need the one, because we didn’t get 270; we got 306 to 223.	0
223-306.	0
A state called Wisconsin, a state called -- Michigan, where -- by the way, where Fiat Chrysler just announced a $4.5 billion incredible -- expansion and new plant, doubling their workforce.	0
Many, many car companies have moved back to Michigan and are continuing to do so.	0
Big numbers.	0
Nobody every thought they'd see that happen.	0
So I think we're going to do even better in 2020.	0
I think we're going to do numbers that people haven’t seen for a long time.	0
The men and women here today are on the frontlines of protecting America’s interests, defending America’s value, and reclaiming our nation’s priceless heritage.	0
It's true.	0
With your help, we are reversing decades of blunders and betrayals.	0
These are serious, serious betrayals to our nation and to everything we stand for.	0
It's been done by the failed ruling class that enriched foreign countries at our expense.	0
"It wasn’t ""America first."""	0
"In many cases, it was ""America last."""	0
Those days are over.	0
Long over.	0
America is winning again.	0
America is respected again.	0
And the world knows it.	0
When I meet with prime ministers, when I meet with presidents -- and I get along with them -- because they know that what's taken place over many years -- not just the Obama administration; long before that -- they can't believe, themselves, that they got away with it.	0
They can't believe it.	0
An impossible thing.	0
And they like me.	0
"And the reason they like me -- they tell me; they say, ""Mr. President..."" I said -- as an example, President Xi of China, I have great respect."	0
We have a great relationship.	0
"I say, ""How is it possible that you got away with this for so long?"""	0
[Laughter]	0
"And he said, ""Because nobody ever asked us to change."""	0
It's true.	0
"When they charge 40 percent tariffs on our cars going into China, and we charge them nothing coming into our country; when they raise their tariff from 10 percent to 25 percent and then to 40 percent -- and they said to me, ""We expected that somebody would call and say you can't do that."""	0
[Laughter]	0
Nobody called, so we just left it.	0
And I don’t blame them.	0
We should’ve been doing the same thing to them.	0
But we didn’t.	0
True.	0
Right?	0
Hard to believe.	0
It's hard to believe.	0
But now things are different.	0
Now we're negotiating with China.	0
They wouldn’t negotiate with previous administrations.	0
But I found some very old laws from when our country was rich -- really rich.	0
The old tariff laws -- we had to dust them off; you could hardly see, they were so dusty.	0
But, fortunately, they weren’t terminated.	0
We started getting politically correct, even back then.	0
But I said, when we were doing the great things, what happened to those laws?	0
And I checked, and I found 301 and 382.	0
I found one, 1938, where we can do what we have to do.	0
But, you know, they had a debate in -- it was really a tough time in our country because we had so much money we didn’t know what the hell to do with it.	0
Tough, tough, tough.	0
It was called the Great Tariff Debate.	0
Mark Levin will look this up.	0
[Laughter]	0
And the problem is, with Mark, if I make a little mistake, he'll let us know on Sunday night.	0
[Laughter]	0
I got to be very careful when I talk about this.	0
But it was the Great Tariff Debate of 1888.	0
And the debate was: We didn’t know what to do with all of the money we were making.	0
We were so rich.	0
And McKinley, prior to being President, he was very strong on protecting our assets, protecting our country.	0
"And he made statements that, ""Others cannot come into our country and steal our wealth and steal our jobs, and build their country and not defend our country."	0
We can't do that.	0
"We can't ever allow that to happen."""	0
And, you know -- I don't know, maybe you know.	0
You know I'm totally off-script, right?	0
[Audience member calls out]	0
Thank you, darling.	0
[Laughter]	0
You know I'm totally off script right now.	0
And this is how I got elected, by being off script.	0
True.	0
And if we don’t go off script, our country is in big trouble, folks.	0
Because we have to get it back.	0
"And when I look at what's happening on the other side, I encourage it. I say, ""No, no..."" -- I think the New Green Deal, or whatever the hell they call it --"	0
[Audience Boos]	0
[Audience Boos]	0
The Green New Deal, right?	0
Green New Deal -- I encourage it.	0
I think it's really something that they should promote.	0
[Laughter]	0
They should work hard on.	0
It's something our country needs desperately.	0
They have to go out and get it.	0
But I'll take the other side of that argument only because I'm mandated to.	0
I'm mandated.	0
But they should stay with that argument.	0
Never change.	0
[Laughter]	0
Never change.	0
No planes.	0
No energy.	0
[Laughter]	0
When the wind stops blowing, that's the end of your electric.	0
[Laughter]	0
Let's hurry up.	0
"Darling -- ""Darling, is the wind blowing today?"	0
"I'd like to watch television, darling."""	0
[Laughter]	0
No, but it's true.	0
So the Great Tariff Debate of 1888 -- and then we had so much money we could do whatever we wanted.	0
We built forces up that were incredible.	0
Then, in 1913, they ended tariffs, okay?	0
They ended tariffs.	0
Somebody got stupid and they ended tariffs.	0
"They said, ""Oh, it's okay for other nations to come in."""	0
I won't use a certain words because it's not politically -- but everybody knows the word I'd love to use.	0
Should I use it?	0
I won't do it.	0
"Our great First Lady always said, ""Don't use certain words, please."""	0
"I said, ""But the audience wanted me to do it."""	0
"She said, ""Don't do it."""	0
And the problem is, if I do do that, they won't put the little preamble that we just went through.	0
"They'll just use the word, and they'll said, ""Isn't that terrible."""	0
So I won't use it.	0
[Laughter]	0
I've learned. Because with the fake news --	0
[Audience Boos]	0
"-- if you tell a joke, if you're sarcastic, if you're having fun with the audience, if you're on live television with millions of people and 25,000 people in an arena, and if you say something like, ""Russia, please, if you can, get us Hillary Clinton's emails."	0
"Please, Russia, please."""	0
Please get us the emails.	0
Please!	0
[Audience chants Trump]	0
So everybody is having a good time.	0
I'm laughing, we're all having fun.	0
"And then that fake CNN and others say, ""He asked Russia to go get the emails."	0
"Horrible."""	0
[Laughter]	0
I mean, I thought -- like, two weeks ago, I'm watching and they're talking about one of the points.	0
He asked Russia for the emails.	0
These people are sick.	0
[Laughter]	0
And I'm telling you, they know the game.	0
They know the game, and they play it dirty -- dirtier than anybody has ever played the game.	0
Dirtier than it's ever been played.	0
But the thing that we've done is very special.	0
Because, on trade, and because of tariffs -- and I know there are people in the Republican Party and people -- really, even conservatives -- good conservatives -- they don’t like tariffs.	0
I'm not liking or not liking.	0
The minimum, the greatest negotiating tool in the history of our country.	0
Do you think China would be sending their top representatives over?	0
Right now, China is paying 25 percent tariff on $50 billion worth of technology goods.	0
I was then going to charge them 25 percent on $200 billion.	0
Not like $200 million -- that's a lot.	0
"This is 200 with a ""B"" -- billion."	0
Two-hundred billion.	0
So -- but I was nice, because we're having a very strong negotiation, which if it weren’t for tariffs -- and I tell this to President Xi; this is nothing to hide.	0
I would never be talking like this because, in theory, it could hurt your negotiating position.	0
But in my case, it can't, because it's true.	0
I was nice, and I left it at 10 percent on $200 billion.	0
And here's the beauty: We've lost so much money with China -- $500 billion a year.	0
And on trade, it's such a disaster; it's $507 billion a year.	0
China -- just one country.	0
We lose with everybody, almost.	0
But China is one country.	0
$507 billion, for many years.	0
So the beauty is this: I have $250 billion more to put tariffs on.	0
The numbers are staggering.	0
Billions of dollars, right now, are pouring into our Treasury.	0
And for those of you that haven’t done the research, if you look, of the 25 percent, our country -- as it's turned out, because it's now been on there for a long while.	0
Our -- and I'm in no rush because I'm fine with it.	0
I'm fine with it.	0
Of the 25 points, we've paid for 4 points, and China has paid for 21 points.	0
Okay?	0
Twenty-one.	0
That’s what the numbers are.	0
It's very simple.	0
"You know, everyone said, ""Oh, it's a tax on our..."" It's not really."	0
And what China and other countries do sometimes is they will subsidize it.	0
So the tax really is incredible.	0
But what it is, beyond everything else, I can negotiate.	0
But then you have senators and a few congressman, but not Mark Meadows.	0
Where is the great Mark Meadows?	0
He's here someplace.	0
Man, has he been good.	0
Mark and Jim Jordan, and -- I want to name every one of those couple of hundred people.	0
Because we do have a lot.	0
I want to name every damn one of them.	0
They have been incredible.	0
They've been fighting.	0
And I just see Mark in the audience.	0
They've been fighting -- with Deb, much more important.	0
His wife is incredible.	0
What an asset.	0
He would be nowhere without her.	0
[Laughter]	0
Right?	0
But they fight so hard on this witch hunt, this phony deal that they put together; this phony thing that now looks like it's dying.	0
So they don’t have anything with Russia.	0
There's no collusion.	0
"So now they go and morph into, ""Let's inspect every deal he's ever done."	0
We're going to go into his finances.	0
We're going to check his deals.	0
"We're going to check..."" These people are sick."	0
[Laughter]	0
They're sick.	0
I saw little Shifty Schiff yesterday.	0
No, it's the first time.	0
"He went into a meeting and he said, ""We're going to look into his finances."""	0
"I said, ""Where did that come from?"""	0
He always talked about Russia -- collusion with Russia.	0
The collusion delusion.	0
[Laughter]	0
So now we're waiting for a report, and we'll find out whether or not, and who we're dealing with.	0
We're waiting for a report by people that weren’t elected.	0
We had -- think of this: We had the greatest election -- in all fairness, I used to hear Andrew Jackson.	0
This was now greater than the election of Andrew Jackson.	0
People say that.	0
No, people say it.	0
I'm not saying it.	0
Right?	0
This was the equivalent or greater.	0
You know, they used to go to Ronald Reagan, when I first started.	0
This is Ronald Reagan.	0
Then we started really doing well, and they were coming from everywhere to vote.	0
Those red hats -- and white ones.	0
The key is in the color.	0
The key is what it says.	0
Make America Great Again, is what it says.	0
Right?	0
Right?	0
But we had the greatest of all time.	0
Now we have people that lost.	0
And unfortunately, you put the wrong people in a couple of positions, and they leave people for a long time that shouldn't be there.	0
And, all of a sudden, they're trying to take you out with bullshit.	0
Okay?	0
[Laughter]	0
With bullshit.	0
Now, Robert Mueller never received a vote, and neither did the person that appointed him.	0
"And as you know, the Attorney General says, ""I'm going to recuse myself."""	0
[Laughter]	0
I'm going to recuse.	0
And I said, why the hell didn’t he tell me that before I put him in?	0
How do you recuse yourself?	0
But the person that appointed Robert Mueller never received a vote.	0
Robert Mueller put 13 of the angriest Democrats in the history of our country on the commission.	1
[Laughter]	1
Now, how do you do that?	1
These are angry, angry people.	0
You take a look at them.	0
One of them was involved with the Hillary Clinton Foundation, running it.	0
Another one has perhaps the worst reputation of any human being I've ever seen.	0
[Laughter]	0
All killers.	0
In fact, it would've been actually better for them if they put half and half, and Mueller can do whatever he wants anyway, which he'll probably do.	0
But we have conflicts.	0
I had a nasty business transaction with Robert Mueller a number of years ago.	0
I said, why isn’t that mentioned?	0
He wanted the job as FBI Director.	0
I mean, these are things that are out there; they know it.	0
Why isn’t that -- and I didn’t give it to him.	0
Why isn’t that mentioned? Jim Comey -- Lyin' James Comey --	0
[Audience Boos]	0
-- is his best friend.	0
James Comey is his best friend.	0
And those are a few of the conflicts.	0
Other than that, it's wonderful.	0
[Laughter]	0
So -- so everybody is waiting.	0
I thought of it this morning, Mark.	0
And I heard you made an incredible speech and statement today.	0
Mark Levin.	0
I heard it was incredible.	0
And I was on the way.	0
But I'll see it later.	0
I guarantee I'll be watching it later.	0
I have one of the great inventions in history.	0
It's called TiVo.	0
[Laughter]	0
I think it's actually better than television, because television is practically useless without TiVo, right?	0
[Laughter]	0
But I'll be watching it later, Mark.	0
But people that got no votes.	0
"But I heard this morning, ""President Trump is waiting for the Mueller report."""	0
I said, wait a minute, let me get this straight.	0
[Laughter]	0
So the Attorney General recuses himself, and I don’t fire him.	0
No obstruction.	0
That's the other thing: If you use your right, if you use your power, if you use Article 2, it's called obstruction.	0
But only for Trump.	0
For nobody else.	0
[Laughter]	0
So the Attorney General is weak and ineffective, and he doesn’t do what he should've done.	0
Somebody that never got a vote writes a powerful letter -- horrible -- about Comey.	0
Every single Democrat said Comey should be fired, or worse, if possible.	0
[Laughter]	0
"Every Republican said -- everybody -- in fact, when I fired Comey, I said, ""You know..."" -- First Lady -- I said, ""Melania, I'm doing something today."	0
"I'm doing it because it really has to be done."""	0
He's bad.	0
He's a bad, bad -- he's a bad, bad guy.	0
That's been proven now with all of the emails and the texts.	0
I'm doing something that has to be done.	0
But you know the good news?	0
It's going to be bipartisan.	0
It's going to be so popular, it's going to be bipartisan.	0
[Laughter]	0
Every Democrat hates him.	0
Every Republican hates him.	0
He did a horrible job at the FBI.	0
Speak to the real agents, the real people.	0
Because the people in the FBI are incredible people -- not the sleaze on top.	0
"And I said to the First Lady -- I said, ""But you know the good news?"	0
The good news is that this is going to be so bipartisan.	0
"Everyone is going to love it."""	0
So we fire Comey.	0
And Schumer -- who called for his resignation many times -- Podesta, I believe that day -- because he still hasn’t gotten over getting his ass kicked, okay?	0
I believe that day called for his resignation.	0
That day.	0
Podesta, the great genius of campaigns.	0
[Laughter]	0
He called for the Comey resignation.	0
Others -- almost every, I would say.	0
Mark, would you say virtually every Democrat, virtually every -- I can't think of anybody that said he's doing a good job.	0
"So I said to Melania, ""Melania, the good news, this will be a popular thing."""	0
[Laughter]	0
And I fire a bad cop.	0
I fire a dirty cop.	0
"And all of a sudden, the Democrats say, ""How dare he fire him."	0
"How dare he do this."""	0
And that's where we are, folks.	0
That's where we are.	0
We're in this swamp of Washington, D.C.	0
But you know what?	0
We're winning, and they're not.	0
We're winning.	0
So, just to finish -- and I'll tell you, Matt Schlapp is loving this.	0
[Laughter]	0
"He's saying, ""This is a lot more than we paid for."""	0
"You know, normally you read a few pages and you say, ""Bye, folks."""	0
But you know what I like about this?	0
Number one, I'm in love, and you're in love.	0
We're all in love together.	0
We've done something that nobody has ever done.	0
Right?	0
It's easy.	0
No, it's easy.	0
You know, a great friend of mine from New York, he's a stone-cold killer.	0
He's a brutal man. He's actually not even a good friend of mine because he'd turn on me in two seconds if it was	0
[Inaudible]	0
.	0
[Laughter]	0
But he's a very rich guy.	0
"And he said, ""What are you going to speak about today?"	0
"Like, what are you going to speak?"""	0
"I said, ""I don't know."	0
"I don't know."""	0
[Laughter]	0
"He said, ""I just heard that you have the biggest crowd in the history of CPAC."	0
They're all over.	0
By the way, not only in this giant room.	0
They're in many hotel rooms all over the place.	0
"You're just better at real estate than they are."""	0
[Laughter]	0
True.	0
But this guy -- you all know his name -- very rich guy.	0
And he has a problem with a thing called public speaking.	0
If he has to speak to more than like five people, he chokes.	0
[Laughter]	0
He can't breathe.	0
You know, juh-juh.	0
Are you okay?	0
"He kills people for a living -- meaning mentally and financially -- but if there's like an audience of nine, it's like ""augh."""	0
[Laughter]	0
"So he said to me, ""How the hell do you do that?"""	0
"And I said, ""It's easy."""	0
And the reason it's easy -- I really mean this -- there's so much love in this room, it's easy to talk.	0
You can talk your heart out.	0
You really could.	0
There's love in this room.	0
You can talk your heart out.	0
It's easy.	0
It's easy.	0
It's easy.	0
And we've had that from the day I came down with your First Lady on the escalator in Trump Tower.	0
It's been easy.	0
And you know what?	0
We never had an empty seat.	0
We went out and helped Ted Cruz.	0
We went out and helped so many people.	0
And I'll tell you what: If we didn’t do those 32 rallies -- and it wasn’t easy.	0
When you're doing rallies with 25-, 30,000 people -- in Texas, we had 109,000 people sign up.	0
We used the Houston Rockets arena; it holds 22,000.	0
Tens of thousands were outside.	0
"We were sending notices, ""Please don’t come."""	0
That's a little different.	0
Usually, people are begging.	0
Well, yeah, like can somebody come?	0
[Laughter]	0
We never had an empty seat. Of course, the Washington Post -- a guy named David Weigel -- he wrote an article, some arena --	0
[Audience Boos]	0
No, listen to this.	0
He wrote an article.	0
He got there four hours early.	0
He took pictures of an empty arena.	0
"He then put out a note -- something to the effect, ""Not very good crowd size, Mr."	0
"President."""	0
And I never saw it because I don’t follow the guy.	0
But thousands of people that were in that arena that was packed with 25,000 people outside that couldn’t get in -- he got there four or five hours early because he doesn’t fly private.	0
You know.	0
[Laughter]	0
And maybe it's because of the carbon footprint.	0
You think maybe that's it?	0
[Laughter]	0
Maybe.	0
Must be the carbon footprint.	0
He just doesn’t want private.	0
But he got there hours early.	0
And, you know, the place hadn’t started taking in people.	0
They weren’t going to take them in.	0
So there were virtually nobody.	0
And, you know, whatever it was -- 18,000 -- when you have nobody, it's a little scary-looking.	0
So he took pictures.	0
And you know who really got even?	0
Our people.	0
Because they were incensed.	0
We had people sitting on the stairwells.	0
We had people sitting in every seat.	0
I don’t think we've had an empty seat since we announced.	0
And from the day we came down the escalator, I really don’t believe we've had an empty seat at any arena, at any stadium.	0
It's been an incredible thing.	0
And that's why I say this has never, ever happened before, and now we have to verify it in 2020 with an even bigger victory.	0
[Applause, Audience chants Four More Years]	0
And, by the way, just to finish that story, the great Sarah Huckabee and Mercedes, who is incredible, sitting right here -- Mercedes, thank you.	0
They always say -- you know, they're good people, right?	0
Much better than I am.	0
"They always say, ""Don't bring it up."	0
Don’t fight.	0
Don’t fight.	0
"Everyone understands."""	0
"I said, ""They don’t understand."""	0
If I don’t explain it, how are they going to understand?	0
So remember the arena one, right?	0
And then it was shown.	0
And the Washington Post had to do -- and this particular writer -- had to do a -- I thought he was going to get fired.	0
I mean, if that were a conservative, he would've been fired on the spot.	0
He would've been humiliated for what he did.	0
Because it was fake news.	0
Nobody was in the arena.	0
There were thousands outside but they hadn’t opened the gates yet.	0
They did the same thing at our big inauguration speech.	0
You take a look at those crowds.	0
And I watched one of the evening shows that are ridiculous, how horrible they are, how mean -- how horrible.	0
And I watched it by mistake.	0
[Laughter]	0
And they showed -- they showed from the White House all the way down.	0
They showed from the Cap- -- they showed -- there were people.	0
Nobody has ever seen it.	0
The Capitol down to the Washington Monument -- people.	0
But I saw pictures that there were no people.	0
[Laughter]	0
Those pictures were taken hours before.	0
Right?	0
And they always mention crowd size.	0
He talks about crowd size.	0
So I'm constantly bugging Mercedes.	0
"Whenever we have a slow moment, I say, ""Mercedes"" -- and Sarah -- ""show them the pictures."	0
Show them.	0
And compare them with what they put on television.	0
"Those pictures were taken hours before."""	0
And remember this also -- not that Obama would ever do this: But we had fencing all the way down to the Washington Monument.	0
And it was raining and it was wet, and the grass was wet.	0
And women and men -- and I consider them totally equal, so I'm not going to say it's harder.	0
[Laughter]	0
In fact, it's probably, with the men I know, it's actually easier for the women to make the walk, right?	0
[Audience Calls Out No]	0
But they had to walk all the way down.	0
They had to walk with high heels, in many cases.	0
They had to walk all the way down to the Washington Monument and then back.	0
"And I looked, and I made a speech, and I said, before I got on -- I said to the people that were sitting next to me, ""I've never seen anything like this."	0
"Look at that crowd."""	0
And it was wide.	0
Wide.	0
We had a crowd -- I've never seen anything like it.	0
"And I have to live -- I have to live with ""crowd size."""	0
It's all a phony deal.	0
But I saw a picture just the other night of practically no people.	0
It was taken hours before our great day.	0
That was a great day for us.	0
That was a great, great day.	0
People came from all over.	0
People came from all over.	0
"So, Sarah said, and Mercedes said, ""Sir, it doesn’t matter."	0
"Nobody cares."""	0
"I said, ""But I care."""	0
[Laughter]	0
And people care.	0
People care.	0
So what I'm going to do is I'll give it to the great one.	0
I'll give it to Mark Levin.	0
And I'll give him the picture.	0
Then I'll show you where they showed, just the other day, an empty field -- like nobody on it.	0
And you'll see the sun.	0
You know, you can see it's very dark, because the sun is like starting to rise, right?	0
[Laughter]	0
And you can have some fun.	0
You're going to get big ratings on your show, I'll tell you that.	0
Sunday night, everybody.	0
Sunday night.	0
Huh?	0
Ten o'clock, right?	0
Sunday night at 10 o'clock.	0
[Audience Member Calls Out, Trump laughs]	0
Thank you.	0
I knew that, actually.	0
But thank you.	0
All right, now let's get back to what I'm here for.	0
[Laughter]	0
And don't fall asleep.	0
Don’t fall asleep, right?	0
Don’t fall asleep.	0
"You know, somebody said, ""Oh, the speech you made, sir, the State of the Union speech was incredible."""	0
They said it was incredible.	0
They said that was so great.	0
And I said -- I said -- I did; I got great reviews, even from some of the really bad ones out there.	0
[Laughter]	0
"Of course, by the following morning, they had to change because the head people called up, ""What are you doing?"""	0
[Laughter]	0
A lot of it is not the people on television, you know.	0
A lot of it is their bosses -- which someday we're going to have to figure out why, Meadows, why that is.	0
Because, you know, if you're building a great country, you have the best employment and unemployment numbers we've ever had.	0
More people are working today in the United States than ever before in the history of our country.	0
And you say, why are they upset by that?	0
Why?	0
Why are they upset by that?	0
We've slashed 30,000 pages of job-killing regulations from the Federal Register.	0
That's an all-time record in the history of the United States, even by Presidents there for eight years, and in one case more.	0
We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history.	1
And we got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big deal.	0
Which should lead to the ending of the disaster known as Obamacare.	0
It should.	0
The great state of Texas has a case, and it was literally based on the individual mandate.	0
Now that it's gone, I don't know how they rule against it.	0
Now we'll have to find out.	0
But that'll soon be up in the Supreme Court of the United States, I hope.	0
And we're going to see what happens.	0
And then we're going to get together with the Democrats and come up with really great healthcare, okay?	0
Really great healthcare.	0
And of the other things we did in our tax package is ANWR.	0
Perhaps the largest field in the world -- oil and gas.	0
I got it approved.	0
And I didn’t want to get it approved for a certain reason, because I thought somebody treated me very badly.	0
Very badly.	0
Don’t get that vote very often.	0
And I said, you know, I don’t want to get it.	0
Then I get a call from a friend of mine, and he's in the oil business.	0
He's not asking for anything.	0
He said -- but he really is a knowledgeable guy when it comes to oil and gas.	0
"He said to me, ""Hey"" -- and they all call me ""Mr."	0
"President."""	0
"I have friends that, for 35 years, ""Hey, Don, how you doing?"	0
Hey, Donny.	0
"I love you, Donny."""	0
For 35 years.	0
"Now they call, ""Mr. President, sir."""	0
[Laughter]	0
How are you?	0
I have a friend -- a very rich guy -- Richard LeFrak, in New York.	0
A builder.	0
A good builder.	0
"He calls me all my life, ""Hey, Don, how you doing?"""	0
I've known this guy so long -- from kindergarten.	0
[Laughter]	0
It's true.	0
Hi, Don, how you doing?	0
How's everything?	0
"And now I get a call the other day, ""Mr. President, how are you, sir?"	0
"How are you?"""	0
"I said, ""Richard, lighten up."	0
"Lighten up."""	0
[Laughter]	0
Call me 'Donald'.	0
Richard, call me 'Donald'.	0
"You've known me for -- I don’t want to say, because I don’t want my wife to hear the number."""	0
[Laughter]	0
But -- it's true.	0
Actually, that's true.	0
That's actually true.	0
"Richard came up; he said, ""I've known your husband for 65 years."""	0
"I said, ""Don’t say that."""	0
[Laughter]	0
"I say, ""Say 25, 30."	0
"Don’t say 65 years."""	0
"But I said, ""Richard -- Richard, call me 'Donald', like you always do."	0
"Call me 'Don'."""	0
Okay.	0
Okay, Don.	0
Okay.	0
He gets his breath.	0
"Uh-huh. Two minutes later -- ""Mr. President..."""	0
[Laughter]	0
That's called respect for the office, right?	0
Maybe that's a good thing, right?	0
Many -- many of my friends.	0
And that wasn’t in the script either, Mark.	0
[Laughter]	0
But we're renegotiating, right now, horrible trade deals that we're cracking down -- and we are really doing a number -- cracking down on countries that cheat, and standing up for the American worker for the first time in many, many decades.	0
Many decades.	0
Our workers have been treated horribly.	0
A country announces they're closing their plant in Michigan or Pennsylvania or Ohio -- they're closing.	0
They're closing a plant; they're going to move to Mexico.	0
They're going to move to China.	0
They're going to move someplace else.	0
They fire all their workers.	0
And then they sell their cars, no tax; just make them in Mexico, sell them back to here.	0
No tax, no nothing.	0
Those days are all gone, folks.	0
They're all gone.	0
They're all gone.	0
And in the new deal with Mexico and Canada, called the USMCA, it's very, very hard -- prohibitively hard -- for a company to fire its 4,000 workers and move to Mexico or some other location.	0
It's now a very costly -- they can do it, I guess, if they want.	0
But it's costly.	0
It's painful.	0
It used to be almost -- I said -- I used to -- I've been talking about this for a long time.	0
I used to say it's almost like we're giving them an incentive to leave our country.	0
Again, I'm for America first.	0
That wasn’t for America first.	0
And we have great companies that are now moving back to our country.	0
They're coming back in.	0
They're coming back in.	0
And, by the way, you know I'm building the wall.	0
We're finishing the wall.	0
We got a lot of money.	0
It's in the thing.	0
[Audience chants Build that Wall]	0
But -- and there will be some people in the room that don’t like this.	0
We're down to 3.7 percent unemployment -- the lowest number in a long time.	0
But think of this: I got all these companies moving in.	0
They need workers.	0
We have to bring people into our country to work these great plants that are opening up all over the place.	0
This was not necessarily what I was saying during the campaign because I never knew we would be as successful as we've been.	0
Companies are roaring back into our country, and now we want people to come in.	0
We need workers to come in, but they've got to come in legally, and they've got to come in through merit, merit, merit.	0
[Audience Chants USA]	0
They've got to come in through merit.	0
They have to be people that can help us.	0
They have to be people that can love our country, not hate our country.	0
We have people in Congress -- right now, we have people in Congress that hate our country.	0
[Audience Boos]	0
And you know that.	0
And we can name every one of them if they want.	0
They hate our country.	0
It's sad.	0
It's very sad.	0
When I see some of the things being made, the statements being made, it's very, very sad.	0
Very, very -- and find out, how did they do in their country?	0
Just ask them, how did they do?	0
Did they do well?	0
Were they succeeding?	0
Just ask that question.	0
"Somebody would say, ""Oh, that's terrible that he brings that up."""	0
But that's okay, I don’t mind.	0
I'll bring it up.	0
[Laughter]	0
How did they do in their country?	0
Not so good.	0
Not so good.	0
But we need workers.	0
We have to bring in workers.	0
One other thing -- because we have a lot of people here that are important people in terms of votes.	0
We have some senators.	0
We have some congressmen.	0
When a senator tells us that he's a free trader, so am I. I'm a fair trader.	0
I'm a free trader.	0
But when a senator said we can't do tariffs, where we make a fortune, or at a minimum, we're able to use this tremendous power that I found -- tremendous -- old stuff.	0
Nobody even knew it existed.	0
I'm able to use it, at a minimum, to negotiate great and fair trade deals.	0
They wouldn't even be talking to us because it's so one-sided.	0
Last year, we lost eight hundred -- this for many years -- almost $800 billion on trade.	0
It's not sustainable.	0
You can't do that.	0
And now we're making great trade deals.	0
But when some of the senators -- good people; I think they're good people.	0
I just don't understand the thinking.	0
So I say, India is a very high-tariff nation.	0
They charge us a lot.	0
When we send a motorcycle to India, it's 100 percent tariff.	0
They charge 100 percent.	0
When India sends a motorcycle to us, we brilliantly charge them nothing.	0
So I want a reciprocal tax, or at least I want to charge a tax.	0
It's called a mirror tax, but it's a reciprocal tax.	0
Now, here's what I don't understand: I've had a lot of people -- Lindsey Graham.	0
I said, Lindsey -- it's not his thing necessarily.	0
It's not the thing that he's most adept at.	0
But he's adept and he's smart.	0
"I said, ""Lindsey, if they charge us a hundred, I'd like a reci-..."" If they charge us, we charge them."	0
"He goes, ""That makes sense to me."""	0
[Laughter]	0
And then he gets on to judiciary and things that, frankly, he likes and finds very interesting.	0
But he's a smart guy, and he said -- I'll never forget.	0
It took me about a minute, which is a long time.	0
I did a bad description.	0
It's so easy.	0
They charge 100; we charge nothing.	0
Now we have reciprocal, so it's 100.	0
But what happens now, for those that really think about tariffs and don't like tariffs for whatever reason might be -- and that's okay.	0
What's going to happen is, in many cases, instead of 100 and 100, you're going to have zero and zero, so you won't have any tariff.	0
Okay?	0
It's going to happen.	0
That's going to happen.	0
"But you have to -- you have to start working on some of the senators that say ""I can't approve this deal."""	0
"I say, ""You know what?"	0
"I want to just charge India"" -- as an example, I'm using it."	0
But India is a very high-tariff nation.	0
I mean, nobody -- nobody knows it because nobody knows what they're doing in Washington.	0
[Laughter]	0
But India is a very, very high-tariff nation, and they charge tremendous -- tremendous numbers.	0
So they charge 100.	0
"So I say, ""I'm not going to charge 100, but I'm going to charge 25 percent."""	0
And I hear this turmoil in the Senate because we're charging 25.	0
So I call a couple of the guys up.	0
"I say, ""Fellas, listen, they're charging us 100 for the exact same product."	0
"I want to charge them 25."""	0
And I feel so foolish charging 25 because it should be 100.	0
But I'm doing 25 only because of you.	0
I want to get your support.	0
Sir, that's not free trade.	0
Where do these people come from?	0
[Laughter]	0
Where do they come from?	0
Where?	0
Where do they come from?	0
I need your help.	0
I need your help -- the voters' help.	0
Where do they come from?	0
So it can only be one of two or three things.	0
Number one, I know they're very smart people.	0
I know they are.	0
And I even like some of them.	0
[Laughter]	0
But they're smart.	0
So we take that out of the equation.	0
So even -- and I know they don't have evil intentions.	0
And the other thing could be, I guess, maybe -- you know, these companies are all owned by people, and these people are very generous.	0
Campaign contributions -- they're very, very generous people.	0
Can that be possible?	0
I don't think so.	0
I hope not.	0
Because we're talking about our country.	0
We can't allow a country to charge 100 percent and we get nothing for the same exact product.	0
For one thing, they don't respect us.	0
"They think we're ""stupido."""	0
They don't respect us.	0
[Laughter]	0
But let me tell you something: The world respects our country again.	0
They respect us.	0
And America is now booming like never before.	0
Other countries are doing very poorly.	0
Other countries are doing very poorly, and that makes it even harder for us to be successful.	0
Plus, we have a gentleman that likes raising interest rates in the Fed.	0
We have a gentleman that loves quantitative tightening in the Fed.	0
We have a gentleman that likes a very strong dollar in the Fed.	0
So with all of those things -- and we want a strong dollar, but let's be reasonable.	0
You understand that.	0
With all of that, we're doing great.	0
Can you imagine if we left interest rates where they were?	0
There's no inflation, essentially.	0
There's no inflation.	0
Can you imagine if we left interest rates where they were?	0
If we didn't do quantitative tightening, taking money out of the market?	0
If we didn't do quantitative -- and this would lead to a little bit lower dollar.	0
A little bit.	0
I want a strong dollar, but I want a dollar that's going to be great for our country, not a dollar that's so strong that it is prohibitive for us to be dealing with other nations and taking their business.	0
Since the election, we've created a number that if I would have said during the campaign, the fake news just back there would have said this is crazy.	0
5.3 million new jobs, including over, now, 600,000 beautiful, brand-new manufacturing jobs that were never going to come back to our country.	0
These are jobs that were never coming back to our country.	0
Remember?	0
Not to talk badly about the other administration, but if that theory went forward with Crooked Hillary winning the election, instead of being up almost 50 percent with the stock market, you would have been down 50 percent.	0
It was heading down.	0
It was going to be a disaster.	0
We have nearly 5 million Americans that have been lifted off of food stamps.	0
Nobody ever thought that was possible.	0
The unemployment rate has reached the lowest in over 51 years.	0
And African American -- and you've heard me say this many times -- Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates are at their all-time historic lows.	0
And African American income has reached an all-time high. So when I'm on the debate stage with one of these maniacs --	0
[Laughter]	0
-- I mean, trains to Hawaii.	0
How do you get to Europe?	0
We haven't figured that one out yet.	0
We don't use airplanes anymore.	0
[Laughter]	0
You saw what I'm doing in California, right?	0
They have a fast train.	0
The fast train goes from San Francisco to Los Angeles.	0
It's over budget by hundreds of billions of dollars, so they have a great idea -- the new governor; nice guy.	0
Yeah, he's a nice guy.	0
When I'm with him face to face, nice.	0
When he speaks about me, not so nice.	0
But face to face, he loves me.	0
[Laughter]	0
He called me up.	0
"He said, ""You're a great President."	0
"You're doing a great job."""	0
He actually did, two weeks ago, three weeks.	0
So he'll probably deny it, but check the phone records at the White House.	0
Everybody else does.	0
[Laughter]	0
Check them.	0
Check them.	0
Check them.	0
Called me up three or four weeks ago.	0
I think they need some forest money, because honestly, the management of the forests is very bad and that's one of the problems they have.	0
"I said, ""You got to get those forests."""	0
We can't keep spending billions and billions and losing hundreds of lives, more importantly.	0
Got to clean it up.	0
It's called management.	0
When a tree falls, you can't let the environmentalist say you can't take that tree out.	0
It becomes like a matchstick, that tree.	0
It hits a flame, it goes up.	0
The leaves -- every once in a while, you have to remove the leaves because they are so -- a guy smoking a cigarette, he throws it away, he doesn't mean it.	0
The thing catches on fire and we lose 400,000 acres and people are killed.	0
You got to have management.	0
But he called me up the other day, recently -- let's say four weeks ago or so.	0
"He said, ""I just want to tell you you're a great President and you're one of the smartest people I've ever met."""	0
That's what he said.	0
Now, that's what he said.	0
Will he admit it?	0
No, I doubt it.	0
[Laughter]	0
But that's what he said.	0
And you're doing a great job. And then he did start talking about, in all fairness, additional money for the fire, which is --	0
[Laughter]	0
-- it's okay.	0
That's okay.	0
We have great talks.	0
I mean, I like him.	0
Gavin Newsom.	0
I like him.	0
Nice guy.	0
But they say things -- you know, politicians, they say things to your face, and then you see two days later they're giving a news conference -- just like, where did that guy come from?	0
Where did he come from?	0
But everyone in this great country, right now, because of our great new economy, is doing well -- except, of course, for the Never Trumpers.	0
But they are on mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.	0
[Laughter]	0
Mouth to mouth.	0
Mouth to mouth.	0
They're hanging in.	0
A couple of them.	0
I mean, these guys have gotten me wrong.	0
Not only Never Trumpers.	0
You have Never Trumpers; you have certain hardline.	0
They're basically dishonest people -- because, look, let's face it: Whether you like me or not -- if my name is Smith instead of Trump, and if you told him I put in over 100 federal judges -- it'll soon be 145 federal judges and 2 Supreme Court judges.	0
And 17 appellate division judges.	0
That we've got the best economy maybe in our history.	0
That we've got the best employment numbers and unemployment numbers in our history.	0
That we've cut more regulations in two years than any President has ever done, whether it's for eight or beyond.	0
That we've taken care of our military with -- $1.7 billion.	0
Think of that.	0
Think of what we did.	0
Think of what we did with our military.	0
Think of the numbers that we have for our military.	0
We have numbers -- nobody has ever heard of these numbers before.	0
And you know, part of the problem that we have -- because I'm a cost cutter.	0
But -- and you are all cost cutters.	0
But we have to take care of our military.	0
We have to.	0
Seven hundred billions dollars we spent.	0
And that was the first year.	0
And then the second year, $716 billion.	0
Now, I have no choice.	0
I'd like to spend much less.	0
Obama was spending much less but our military was being depleted.	0
He was fighting in endless wars; they'd never end.	0
And, by the way, as of probably today or tomorrow, we will actually have 100 percent of the caliphate in Syria.	0
One hundred percent.	0
One hundred percent.	0
And we'll leave a small group of guys and gals.	0
But we want to bring our people back home.	0
We want to bring our people back home.	0
It's time.	0
Been in these wars.	0
We were going to be in Syria for four months.	0
We ended up five years.	0
This fighting -- they just like to fight.	0
We want to fix our country.	0
We want to fix our bridges, our highways, our roads, our schools.	0
We want to fix our country up.	0
It's time.	0
It's time.	0
"But I was told by a general, who I had to fire -- I said, ""General, how long before we get 100 percent of the caliphate?"""	0
"He said, ""Sir, two years."""	0
"I said, ""I can't take it two years."""	0
And then I flew to Iraq; first time I left the White House -- because I stayed in the White House for months and months because I wanted the Democrats to get back from their vacations from Hawaii and these other places.	0
[Laughter]	0
And I figured it would look good if I stayed in the White House so that you people all love me and vote for me, okay?	0
I figured it would look good.	0
[Laughter]	0
I figured it would look good.	0
So I stayed in the White House.	0
"And I'll tell you what: I was there -- I told my wife, ""Go to Florida."	0
"Enjoy your Christmas."""	0
I stayed for Thanksgiving.	0
I said -- I mean, I was in the White House for a long time.	0
Months.	0
Months.	0
I had cabin fever in the White House.	0
[Laughter]	0
But if you've got to have cabin fever, that's the place to do it, okay?	0
[Laughter]	0
But I was there, I don't know, for a number of months, through Christmas.	0
I spent my New Year's all by myself.	0
[Laughter, Audience calls out Awww]	0
Don't cry.	0
All -- it was me and about 500 men and women outside with machine guns.	0
[Laughter]	0
I never saw so many beautiful-looking machine guns.	0
"I'd look at that equipment and I'd say, ""Man..."" They sit in the trees."	0
They sit on the lawn.	0
"I told people, ""I'm in this mess"" -- you know, people don't know how big the White House."	0
First of all, it's one of the most beautiful places in the world.	0
It's really -- I made a lot of money with luxury.	0
"This building is -- 1799 -- which, of course, when President Xi comes, I say ""1799,"" like it's old."	0
To him, that's like a brand-new house in China.	0
[Laughter]	0
In China, they go back -- they go back 8,000 years.	0
So that's -- that's like a new -- that's like a new residence.	0
But I sat in the White House for months and months, except I took a day off.	0
I flew to a lovely place called Iraq, and I flew at night and I got there at night.	0
"And I said to myself, this is interesting, because they say, ""Sir, all of the lights in the plane, sir, are going off."""	0
"I say, ""Why?"""	0
[Laughter]	0
Because we're getting ready to land.	0
We're an hour out.	0
"I said, ""What about the shades?"""	0
Well, we want it better than that. May be like 	0
[Inaudible]	0
So we turned the lights off, put the shades down.	0
This is a big seven forty -- Air Force One.	0
And we're landing, and I go up and I look.	0
And I've landed; I like to sit with pilots.	0
I respect people that know what they're doing, and these are the best in the world.	0
I really do.	0
These are the best in the world.	0
"And the pilot says, Sir, we're landing in approximately one and a half minutes."""	0
"I say, ""But there's no runway."""	0
No, sir, the runway is right up there, sir.	0
"I say, ""I don't see it."""	0
I have pretty good vision.	0
[Laughter]	0
At least for my age I have good vision.	0
[Laughter]	0
I guess for my age I have great vision.	0
But I don’t have vision like a 35-year-old captain.	0
"He said, ""No, it's right up there."""	0
"I said, ""I'm sorry, Captain, how about this: Should we lift off and try it again?"	0
"Captain, there's no runway."""	0
Anyway -- he sits right up there and we land.	0
There's practically not lights.	0
These are little pin spots. And I said, think of this: We spent $7 trillion in the Middle East and we can't land with the lights on --	0
[Laughter]	0
-- 20 years later.	0
How bad is it?	0
No, seriously, how bad is it?	0
How bad is it?	0
Seven trillion dollars and we have to fly in with no lights.	0
But I met some incredible people.	0
I met some incredible people -- generals.	0
One of them came from Syria -- the operation in Syria.	0
And I was upset with my generals because they weren't getting it finished.	0
I want the job done.	0
I want to bring our people back home.	0
It's not fair.	0
And this is why I flew.	0
So I met generals I didn't know.	0
General one, general two, general three.	0
I mean, these generals -- there's no person in Hollywood that could play the role.	0
These guys are like perfect people.	0
"I said, ""What's your name?"	0
Sir, my name is Raisin.	0
What the hell kind of a name?	0
[Laughter]	0
"I said, ""Raisin, like the fruit?"""	0
"He goes, ""Yes, sir, Raisin."""	0
What's your last name?	0
Caine.	0
Raisin Caine.	0
[Laughter]	0
"I said, ""You got to be kidding me."""	0
It's true.	0
Raisin Caine.	0
I just made him a big star.	0
[Laughter]	0
"Just like I did with Mattis when I said, ""We're going to give you a new nickname, because 'Chaos' is not a good nickname."""	0
So we changed his name.	0
"Called him ""Mad Dog."""	0
But it wasn’t working too well.	0
Mad Dog wasn't working too well.	0
So what happened is I flew to Iraq.	0
I wanted to meet the people on the site, because I learn more sometimes from soldiers, what's going on, than I do from generals.	0
I do.	0
I hate to say it.	0
And I tell that to the generals all the time.	0
But I didn't have to go there.	0
I didn't have to go there.	0
Because I meet -- and I land in this airport, the most incredible thing.	0
We must have spent $3 billion building it.	0
It's one of the reasons I don't want to leave Iraq so fast.	0
"I said, ""Well, how do we leave this thing?"""	0
So I have Raisin Caine and three other generals, colonels, sergeants.	0
"And I said, ""Bring the cameras."	0
I'm going to make a movie.	0
"This is the most incredible thing."""	0
[Laughter]	0
"And I said to the generals, ""Listen, we got to get out."	0
"I want to know why is it going to take two years to knock off 2 or 3 or 4 percent, which is what we had left."""	0
It won't, sir.	0
"And I said, ""Tell me why it won't."""	0
It won't, sir.	0
If we attack them in a different manner, we can do it much faster.	0
"Okay, General Raisin Caine, how fast can -- ""Sir, we can have it totally finished in one week."""	0
"I said, ""One week?"	0
"I was told two years."""	0
[Laughter]	0
One week?	0
That's right, sir.	0
We're only hitting them from a temporary base in Syria.	0
But if you gave us permission, we could hit them from the back, from the side, from all over -- from the base that you're right on, right now, sir.	0
They won't know what the hell hit them.	0
They won't know what the hell hit them, sir.	0
"And I said, ""Why didn't my other generals tell me that?"	0
"Why didn't they tell me that?"""	0
"I said, ""Did you tell them that?"""	0
Not our place to say it, sir.	0
They come in from Washington, sir.	0
We have to take orders.	0
You're the first one to ask us our opinion.	0
It's true.	0
It's true.	0
True.	0
True.	0
"So I went back and I said, ""I'm going to get back to you soon, Raisin."	0
"I think you're great."""	0
[Laughter]	0
I like you, Raisin Caine.	0
"But I did say -- I said, ""Well, hey, listen, we're in Iraq."	0
"Isn't that very far away from..."" ""I was here in a very short time, sir."	0
"I flew right in."""	0
Of course, he's taking a plane that goes 2,000 miles an hour, you know.	0
But incredible.	0
What you learn from being on the site -- my father was a builder.	0
"He always used to say, ""Nobody ever got rich by sitting behind their desk."""	0
It's true.	0
It's true.	0
"He'd say, ""You got to be on this site."	0
You got to be with the contractors.	0
You got to see if they're ripping you off.	0
You've got to collect every nail that's dropped, every piece of wood.	0
You can sell it.	0
You got to be on the site.	0
You got to see while they're building, while they're under construction, is that wall straight or if it's crooked.	0
"And you have to fix it before they build it, not after they build it, when you rip everything down."""	0
True.	0
You don’t get rich by sitting behind a desk.	0
So I didn't want to do that.	0
And I'm in the White House and I was lonely.	0
"I said, ""Let's go to Iraq."""	0
[Laughter]	0
And I had a hell of a meeting in Iraq.	0
And I'll tell you, those generals -- not just Raisin Caine, General Caine.	0
Those generals were great.	0
They were great.	0
They knew their stuff.	0
They were gung-ho.	0
And it is true -- I mean, you talk central casting.	0
These guys -- you couldn’t -- I mean, it's incredible.	0
They had a master sergeant.	0
I could take him right now, bring him to Hollywood, make a military movie, and he's the star of the movie.	0
That happened once before, you know.	0
That did happen once before.	0
Remember?	0
They brought a man in -- a sergeant, a drill sergeant -- to teach some actor how to be a drill sergeant.	0
The drill sergeant was so incredible that he ended up starring in the movie, and he should have gotten the Academy Award, by the way, but he didn't.	0
That's because Hollywood discriminates against our people.	0
You know the movie I'm talking about, right?	0
What was that movie?	0
You know the movie.	0
But while we're making great strides, and our country is doing as well -- and maybe, in many ways, better than it's ever done before -- Democrat lawmakers are now embracing socialism.	0
They want to replace individual rights with total government domination.	0
[Audience Boos]	0
Just this week, more than 100 Democrats in Congress signed up for a socialist takeover of American healthcare.	0
Their radical government-run plan -- if you call it that -- would lead to colossal tax increases -- increases like you've never seen before -- and take away private coverage from over 180 million Americans.	0
[Audience calls out No]	0
And we have some great private coverage, and we've initiated some incredible plans, like the new cooperative plan, where you get better insurance than Obamacare for a fraction of the cost.	0
But perhaps nothing is more extreme than the Democrats' plan to completely takeover American energy and completely destroy America's economy through their new $100 trillion Green New Deal.	0
[Audience Boos]	0
Under the Green New Deal -- which somebody described as a high school term paper written by a poor student --	0
[Laughter]	0
-- it's true.	0
It's true.	0
Who would believe it?	0
It so -- it's so bad.	0
But I don't -- I'll be honest with you, folks.	0
"I said -- you know, it's Saturday morning, and I said, ""Matt, should we do a little more, like, spend time?"""	0
"He said, ""Yeah, would you do that?"""	0
By the way, everybody okay?	0
I haven't seen anybody leaving.	0
I haven't seen anybody.	0
I know one thing: If Mark Levin gets up and leaves, I'll finish very quickly, because then I know.	0
[Laughter]	0
But I haven't seen anyone leaving.	0
Nobody has left.	0
I watch those doors.	0
Because a lot of times -- a lot of times -- well, one time, the press said people left.	0
Yeah, you know where they went?	0
To the bathroom.	0
And then they came back.	0
[Laughter]	0
Two people.	0
They showed two empty seats in a stadium of 19,000.	0
They showed two empty seats.	0
"The people left right in front of me, and I said, ""Oh, man, maybe this isn't a good job I'm doing."""	0
Then they came back.	0
They went to the bathroom.	0
[Laughter]	0
And a certain fake news deal showed a picture on the front page of these two empty seats.	0
They said Trump had empty seats.	0
We never have empty seats.	0
The Green New Deal would completely abolish the American oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear power industries, of which we're now the leader in the world.	0
We're the biggest now in the world because of moves that I've made.	0
Happened over the last two years, by the way.	0
And we're trying to speed up pipelines in Texas, which would have taken 15 years.	0
We think we're almost very close to getting them approved.	0
When that happens, we'll go probably another 30 to 40 percent.	0
We need pipeline approval.	0
We're going to have it very quickly.	0
It would have taken -- it was going to be a 14- to 15-year process.	0
We should have it done.	0
We'll pick up 30 to 40 percent more.	0
Their plan would remove every gas-powered car from American roads.	0
Oh, that's not so bad.	0
They want you to have one car instead of two, and it should be electric, okay?	0
So tell people, no more cars.	0
No more cars.	0
I think the auto industry is not going to do too well under this plan.	0
What do you think, Meadows?	0
How is this?	0
Will the auto industry be good?	0
I don’t think so.	0
It's not looking good.	0
I think maybe -- maybe you're going to see some bad stock prices if that passes.	0
It would end air travel.	1
But you'll get on a train, don't worry about it.	0
You just have to cross off about 95 percent of the world.	0
And it would force the destruction or renovation of virtually every existing structure in the United States.	0
New York City would have to rip down buildings and rebuild them again.	0
I don't think so.	0
This is the craziest plan, and yet I see senators that are there for 20 years -- white hair.	0
See, I don't have white hair.	0
[Laughter]	0
I don’t have white hair.	0
No, I see these white-haired, longtime senators standing behind this young woman, and she's ranting and raving like a lunatic.	0
[Laughter]	0
"And these senators -- these senators: ""Yes, I agree with this."	0
"Yes, I agree."""	0
The crazy female senator from the state of Ohio, the state of Hawaii.	0
Right?	0
She's like -- she's like a crazed person.	0
What she said about men is so bad.	0
What she said about men is so bad.	0
But she's standing in the hallway.	0
And she didn't know too much about the plan because she's -- you know, she can't understand that plan.	0
[Laughter]	0
Which probably makes her smart, actually.	0
"Now, this is the senator from Hawaii, and they're saying to her, ""What do you think?"	0
"Well, I don't know how people are going to get to Hawaii, but I'm in favor of the plan."""	0
[Laughter]	0
I don't get it.	0
I don't get it.	0
I don't get it.	0
So she's in favor of the plan, but you won't be able to get to -- well, we can take boats, I guess.	0
We'll go back to boats.	0
This is the new Democrat platform for the -- and I don't want to talk them out of it.	0
I don't.	0
I don't.	0
I swear I don't.	0
This is a killer.	0
I got to get off this subject.	0
I want them to embrace this plan.	0
I want them to go and sell this plan.	0
I just want to be the Republican that runs against them for that.	0
I'm going to regret this speech.	0
This speech should have been delivered one year from now, not now, damn it.	0
[Laughter]	0
"Because they're going to grab out together, and they're going to say, ""You know, this guy is really laying for us."""	0
I should've saved the Pocahontas thing for another year.	0
[Laughter]	0
Because I've destroyed her political career, and now I won't get a chance to run against her, and I would’ve loved it.	0
[Laughter]	0
We got to -- you know, I don't want to knock out all of the good stuff and end up with somebody that's actually got talent.	0
That would be terrible.	0
[Laughter]	0
So I do like the Green New Deal.	0
[Laughter]	0
I respect it greatly.	0
It should be part of the dialogue of the next election.	0
[Laughter]	0
And I think it has tremendous promise and tremendous potential for the future of our country.	0
Socialism is not about the environment.	0
It's not about justice.	0
It's not about virtue.	0
Socialism is about only one thing.	0
"It's called ""power for the ruling class."""	0
That's what it is.	0
Look at what's happening in Venezuela and so many other places.	0
All of us are here today because we know that the future does not belong to those who believe in socialism.	0
And I heard, yesterday, a great speech from our Vice President Mike Pence, talking about this very subject -- and talking about it beautifully.	0
The future belongs to those who believe in freedom.	0
I have said it before and I'll say it again: America will never be a socialist country -- ever.	0
[Audience Chants USA]	0
Young Americans -- I love young Americans.	0
Speaking of young Americans -- Candace, stand up.	0
Candace is getting married.	0
Stand up.	0
You've been incredible.	0
Thank you.	0
Your whole group has been great.	0
You're getting married.	0
Seems like a nice guy to me.	0
[Laughter]	0
Congratulations.	0
You've been so great.	0
Thank you very much, Candace.	0
Thanks.	0
And, Charlie, what a job you're doing.	0
Where's Charlie?	0
Where's Charlie?	0
Where is Charlie Kirk?	0
Because he has done an incredible job.	0
Thank you very much, Charlie.	0
But young Americans like you are leading the revival of American liberty, sovereignty, and self-determination in the face of left-wing intolerance.	0
The anger -- the unbelievable anger -- I see it every day.	0
Fortunately, for you, it's mostly pointed at me.	0
[Laughter]	0
You have the courage to speak the truth, to do what is right, and to fight for what you believe, and keep doing it.	0
We reject oppressive speech codes, censorship, political correctness, and every other attempt by the hard left to stop people from challenging ridiculous and dangerous ideas.	0
These ideas are dangerous.	0
Instead, we believe in free speech, including online and including on campus.	0
And, by the way, there's a young gentleman with us today.	0
There's a young gentleman.	0
I turned on my television the other day, and I saw somebody that was violently punched in the face.	0
Violently punched.	0
And I said that's disgusting.	0
By a bully I'd like to do a lot of things.	0
But, of course, we would never do that.	0
"Because if I ever said violence, they would say, ""Donald Trump attacked."""	0
No, no, no.	0
Just for the media: I'm sure he's a lovely young man; just had a little temper tantrum.	0
[Laughter]	0
I've been there before with those people.	0
I don’t want to do it again.	0
So, the man's name is Hayden Williams.	0
Where's Hayden?	0
Where is he?	0
Where is he?	0
Hayden, come up here.	0
Come up here.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
So, at the Leadership Institute, we're committed to making campuses great again.	0
And I thank you so much for bringing me up here to let me speak.	0
It's great -- it's great that I'm being recognized, and -- but there's so many conservative students across the country who are facing discrimination, harassment, and worse, if they dare to speak up on campus.	0
So I'm glad that we could -- we could, you know, bring this to the forefront.	0
And I'd just like to say, you know, if these socialist progressives had their way, they would put our Constitution through the paper shredder in a heartbeat.	0
So, you know, it's as important now than ever the work at Leadership Institute and Campus Reform -- you know, exposing these liberal abuses to the public -- it's as important now as ever.	0
And these students -- these students do it because they have a love of our nation and freedom, and frankly, a love for you, Mr. President.	0
So if you keep defending us, we'll keep defending you.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
Stay here for a second.	0
So, here's the one thing.	0
I was going to call him, but I don't have to now.	0
I see him here.	0
But here's the one thing: I learned a number of things.	0
First of all, he can take a punch.	0
If Muhammad Ali could take a punch, he can take a punch.	0
[Laughter]	0
Because you weren’t going to go down no matter how -- that was a hell of a hard punch.	0
He was a strong guy.	0
But you know what?	0
You've got yourself a great lawyer.	0
I know your lawyer.	0
She is a great lawyer.	0
Just tell her to do me a favor: Sue him.	0
But he's probably got nothing, but sue him forever.	0
But sue the college, the university.	0
And maybe sue the state.	0
Ladies and gentlemen, he took a hard punch in the face for all of us.	0
Remember that.	0
He took a punch for all of us.	0
And we can never allow that to happen.	0
And here is, in closing with Hayden -- here's the good news: He is going to be a very wealthy young man.	0
That's okay.	0
[Laughter]	0
Go get 'em, Hayden.	0
Today I'm proud to announce that I will be very soon signing an executive order requiring colleges and universities to support free speech -- if they want federal research dollars.	0
[Audience Chants USA]	0
If they want our dollars, and we give it to them by the billions, they've got to allow people like Hayden and many other great young people, and old people, to speak.	0
Free speech.	0
And if they don't, it will be very costly.	0
That'll be signed very soon.	0
Every day, we're restoring common sense and the timeless values that unite us all.	0
We believe in the Constitution and the rule of law.	0
We believe in the First Amendment right.	0
And we believe in religious liberty.	0
And we believe strongly in the Second Amendment and the right to keep and bear arms -- which is under siege, folks.	0
They have a lot of plans.	0
It's under siege.	0
Be careful.	0
But I'll protect you, I promise you that.	0
I'll protect you.	0
Because it all has to come through my office.	0
And we hopefully are going to be here for six more years, so you're in good shape.	0
We believe in the American Dream, not in the socialist nightmare.	0
And we believe in the words of our national motto: In God We Trust.	0
Every day, my presidency will defend American families.	0
We will defend America's workers -- our great, great cherished workers -- that now we're taking care of.	0
They're not losing their jobs.	0
We're creating those jobs.	0
We're not letting those companies destroy their lives anymore.	0
We will defend the American way of life, and we will always defend America's borders.	0
Because without borders, as I've said many times before, we don't have a country.	0
The lawless chaos on our southern border provides a lucrative cash flow to some of the most dangerous criminal organizations on the planet.	0
Deadly cartels constantly -- daily, hourly -- violate our borders to flood our cities with drugs that kill thousands and thousands of our citizens violently.	0
What are these people talking about when they talk about the border?	0
Keep it open.	0
Keep what open?	0
Have you been there?	0
Have you seen?	0
I just got back.	0
I've been there many times.	0
I see what's happening.	0
I don't like it.	0
But I have to tell you, our Border Patrol, our ICE agents, our law enforcement, the job they do -- and they don't have the backup of a wall, in many cases -- the job they do is incredible.	0
These ruthless cartels terrorize innocent communities on both sides of the border and spread instability throughout our hemisphere.	0
When I was there two weeks ago, 26 people were killed very close to where I was, on the Rio Grande.	0
Sounds nice, right?	0
The Rio Grande.	0
Rough.	0
Rough stuff.	0
Twenty-six people were killed, and they were buried right near where I was standing.	0
And the paper doesn't write about it.	0
The news doesn't write about it.	0
In the last two years alone, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests.	0
Think of what that means.	0
Think of that -- arrests.	0
I'm not talking about people coming in.	0
I'm talking they went out and arrested 266,000 people who have criminal records and, in some cases, for murder.	0
Who the hell wants to do that?	0
Thank God they're doing it because I don't want to do it.	0
It's dangerous.	0
It's hard.	0
But they love our country, and they're tough people, but they love our country.	0
Including those charged or convicted of approximately 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, 25,000 burglaries, 4,000 kidnappings, and 4,000 violent murders.	0
These are people that ICE is going in and getting, and either putting in jail or ideally bringing them back to other countries and letting them put in jail, because we don’t want them.	0
We don't want to have to pay for them for 50 years.	0
You want them to pay a price, but we don't want to have to pay for them for 50 years.	0
"And all the nonsense you hear about ""the people that come in illegally are far better than the people we have"" -- it's not true, folks."	0
Okay?	0
It's false.	0
It's false propaganda.	0
Right?	0
One recent study from FAIR -- F-A-I-R -- found that illegal aliens are incarcerated at three times the rate of legal residents.	0
Those are the numbers.	0
And if you look at prison population in federal prisons, these federal prisons are -- the number is staggering.	0
The number of illegals -- far, far, far greater than any proportion of our population.	0
But you don't hear that; you hear like these people are the greatest people in the world.	0
Just ask the Angel Moms how good are there.	0
Those great Angel Moms who were treated so badly -- so badly.	0
Incredible people.	0
But the simple reality is that every crime committed by an illegal immigrant is a crime that should never have happened in the first place.	0
The border crisis is also a heartbreaking humanitarian tragedy.	0
Vicious coyotes, smugglers, and human traffickers prey upon innocent women and children.	0
One in three women is sexually assaulted on the dangerous journey north.	1
"When I ran for president, my first speech, I mentioned the word ""rape."""	0
The press went after me; I couldn't believe it.	0
"I said, ""Will it be like this always?"""	0
The answer was yes.	0
It even got worse.	0
"From day one, I mention the word ""rape."""	0
If you look at that speech, that was so innocent compared to what's really happening.	0
That was a very innocent speech compared to the real facts.	0
Illegal immigration is not compassionate.	0
It's inhumane, unjust, and cruel.	0
The media fights me on this, but I say it: Mothers who love their daughters, when their daughters are getting ready to make that 2,000-mile trek up through Mexico -- and frankly, I wish Mexico would stop them at their northern border, at our -- I wish Mexico would stop them.	0
Because you know, they have a border.	0
They call it their southern border.	0
It's 2,000 miles down from our southern border.	0
I wish Mexico would stop them.	0
But they have their own difficulties.	0
Frankly, I understand that.	0
We're working along well with them.	0
And they are doing a lot of things to help us with asylum and other elements of what we're doing.	0
But mothers, who love their daughters, give them massive amounts of birth control pills because they know their daughters are going to be raped on the way up to our southern border.	0
Think of that.	0
True story, told to me by the Border Patrol.	0
So true and so sad.	0
Think of how evil that is.	0
Think of how bad it is.	0
Those caravans -- you look at those caravans, and some are phenomenal people.	0
But in those caravans you have stone-cold killers.	0
You had the interview done by some innocent person who I think is actually back there now.	0
And what is it that you want asylum for?	0
Why are you coming to America?	0
Uh, murder.	0
"She goes, ""What?"""	0
Murder.	0
I mean, what's going on is incredible.	0
And when those caravans are formed, do you think those countries that we used to give a lot of money to -- I've cut it way back.	0
I've cut it way back.	0
Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador.	0
Do you think they're giving us, as we say, their best and their finest?	0
Oh, let's send our best people up to America.	0
Let's have our best people go in the caravan so we can give America our greatest people.	0
No, no, no, no.	0
They give us some very bad people.	0
People with big, long crime records.	0
People with tremendous violence in their past.	0
Murderers, killers, drug dealers, human traffickers.	0
They want to keep their good people because they're smart.	0
It's so sad to see how stupid we've been.	0
Border Patrol recently reported apprehending 7,000 unlawful migrants in a single week on just one part of the Texas border, a couple of weeks ago.	0
Our immigration system is stretched far beyond the breaking point.	0
To confront this national security crisis, last month I declared a national emergency.	0
A national emergency.	0
And when I see these people -- and they're good people -- some senators, mostly -- I tell you, the House has been fantastic.	0
The House -- you know, backing we've had from the House has really been -- I'm talking about in the last short period of time.	0
There's a lot of spirit in the House, and I think in the Senate too, but we're going to have to see because we have a vote coming up.	0
And a lot of people talk about precedent.	0
Precedent.	0
That if we do this, the Democrats will use national emergency powers for something that we don't want.	0
They're going to do that anyway, folks.	0
The best way to stop that is to make sure that I win the election.	0
That's the best way to stop that.	0
They're going to do it anyway.	0
They'll do it anyway.	0
"I watch -- good people, they're friends of mine, ""We're very concerned with setting precedent."""	0
"That's ""precedent"" not ""president."""	0
[Laughter]	0
Precedent.	0
We're very concerned about setting precedent.	0
I'm very concerned with having murderers and drug traffickers, and drugs and drug cartels, pouring into our country.	0
That's what I'm concerned about.	0
And the Democrats, they're going to do whatever they do if they get into power, and it won't have a damn thing to do with whether or not we approve our national emergency.	0
Because let me tell you -- they don't like it when I say it -- but we are being invaded.	0
We're being invaded by drugs, by people, by criminals.	0
And we have to stop it.	0
And we want people to come in, as I said before, but they have to come in legally and with merit.	0
Previous presidents have used their national emergency power to promote democratic elections in Belarus, to ensure political stability in Burundi, and to defend the sovereignty of Lebanon.	0
And you know what?	0
That's okay.	0
In Lebanon -- it's good.	0
Fine.	0
Use it.	0
But we need it right here in our country.	0
We have to use it for our country.	0
Many emergency declarations have been used to protect people in faraway nations and distant lands.	0
Now we are protecting, finally, our people.	0
You.	0
Our people.	0
And we are proudly standing with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol and law enforcement.	0
Illegal immigration is also deeply unfair to American workers and taxpayers, including millions and millions of hardworking legal immigrants.	0
If you care about helping immigrants and care about their success, if you care about reducing poverty and raising living standards, then you must support a safe, strong, and very, very secure border.	0
We need an immigration policy that helps all Americans thrive, flourish, prosper.	0
We need an immigration policy that's going to be great for our corporations and our great companies.	0
We need an immigration policy where people coming into our country can love our country and love our fellow citizens.	0
And this includes shutting down sanctuary cities.	0
And we want to end catch-and-release.	0
We catch them, we realize they're a criminal, and we have to release them.	0
Think of this: They come onto our land, they put one foot on our land.	0
We now have to take them through a massive court trial.	0
Who does this?	0
"Other countries say, ""Get the hell out of here."""	0
We have to take them through court.	0
So we catch them.	0
We talk to them.	0
If they're criminals, or if they're not, we release them.	0
"We say, ""Come back for a hearing in front of a judge."""	0
You know how many judges you need to do this?	0
We have 900,000 people backlogged.	0
That's the good news.	0
The bad news?	0
Nobody shows up.	1
Three percent of the people come back for a trial.	1
It's insane.	0
Not my fault I inherited this mess, but we're fixing it.	0
We have to end chain migration, and we have to cancel the visa lottery.	0
Every American, no matter where they're born, will benefit from the creation of a lawful immigration system.	0
It is such -- you talk about an emergency.	0
Our immigration system is so broken, folks.	0
It's so broken.	0
It's so sad to see.	0
It's incompetent.	0
It's laughed at all over the world.	0
We have people pouring in from not just the southern border in Mexico.	0
From China.	0
They have a baby on our land.	0
The baby becomes a citizen.	0
Welcome to the United States for hopefully 90 years.	0
Okay?	0
And then the parents come in with the baby because the baby is a citizen.	0
This is like crazy.	0
"They used to call it ""anchor babies"" but they don't use that term anymore because it doesn't sound nice."	0
Our laws are so crazy.	0
But one by one, we're finding ways.	0
You know, they call them loopholes.	0
A lot of our laws -- loopholes.	0
Well, I'm finding loopholes to get around the loophole.	0
Okay?	0
[Laughter]	0
Because our Congress can't act.	0
They can't act.	0
They just can't act.	0
The Democrats in Congress don't want to touch any of it.	0
"Visa lottery -- that's where they put in the names; they put it in a lottery, and you pick, ""Oh, here's a wonderful person."	1
"Wonderful."""	0
You know, he killed four people.	0
Here's -- here's another wonderful.	0
[Laughter]	0
"And then they get in and we say, ""Gee, that person just came into our country."	0
"He just robbed a store and killed somebody."""	0
How is that possible?	0
Because they send us the people they don't want.	1
The biggest form of subsidy we give to other nations.	0
Immigration systems that prioritize the admission of those who can support themselves financially and contribute.	0
We want people that can help themselves, that can support themselves.	0
We have people coming in.	0
We support them from the day they come in until the day they die.	0
We can't do that as a country.	0
We can't afford to do that as a country.	0
Sadly, on immigration and so many other issues, Democrat lawmakers have totally abandoned the American mainstream.	0
But that's going to be good for us in 2020.	0
They're embracing open borders, socialism, and extreme late-term abortion.	0
[Audience Boos]	0
Weeks ago, lawmakers in New York cheered as they passed legislation to allow babies to be ripped from the womb of their mother right up to the very moment of death.	0
Then, in an act and a statement, the likes of which I don't think I've ever heard, in Virginia, the governor -- a Democrat -- stated that he would allow babies to be born, to be born outside.	0
He would wrap them.	0
He would take care of them.	0
And then he'll talk to the mother and the father as to what to be done.	0
And if they didn't want the child, who is now outside of the womb -- long outside of the womb -- they will execute the baby after birth.	1
[Audience Boos]	1
They will execute the baby after birth.	0
And that's one many people have never even heard of or thought about.	0
This is a radical agenda by the Democrats.	0
And when you put something up, as was just put up before the Senate, everybody on the Democrat side votes for it.	0
By the way, I have to say one thing: They're lousy politicians and they have lousy policy.	0
They have policy I could never sell if I wanted to.	0
But -- but -- big but -- they always stick together.	0
And the Republicans don't remember that.	0
Remember that.	0
They always stick together.	0
They vote in blocs.	0
They have 47.	0
We had a tremendous victory.	0
We were given no credit.	0
I can't go and campaign for all of the people in the House.	0
Too many.	0
And guys like Meadows wins by so many points he doesn't need any help.	0
He doesn't need it.	0
"I say, ""Mark, do you need any help?"""	0
No, I'm okay.	0
[Laughter]	0
He'll win by 30, 35.	0
They're okay.	0
These guys -- you know a funny thing?	0
The ones that love Trump, the ones that are really the Trumpers -- like Meadows, Jordan, Gates, so many of them.	0
I don’t want to -- I could just name so many.	0
They're the ones that win with that.	0
I mean, it's like they don't even have an election.	0
It's the ones that sort of -- they're a little shy about embracing what we're all about, they get clobbered.	0
They get clobbered.	0
Take a look.	0
Those are the ones that get clobbered.	0
But the good news is they're all starting to find that out.	0
Just this week, Senate Democrats opposed legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children who survive abortions.	0
Virtually every Democrat voted against protecting these precious babies.	0
Every one.	0
They vote in groups.	0
And we did have that great victory.	0
We won for 51.	0
And two that we didn't like got out.	0
They said they retired.	0
They didn't retire.	0
They were retired.	0
"They said, ""These two senators have decided to retire."""	0
No, no, no.	0
They retired because they had like very little support.	0
Like how about 5 percent?	0
Any percent.	0
No, we did great.	0
We had 53 we picked up in the Senate.	0
They were going to win the Senate, remember?	0
And I'll tell you, folks, I worked hard.	0
I did 32 big, fat rallies.	0
And those rallies brought us to a tremendous Senate victory so that we can continue onward with our judges and our approvals.	0
"And the fake news back there, they love to say ""Donald Trump suffered a big defeat."""	0
First of all, we won the Senate, which, frankly, judges -- you know, I hate to say it: In all due respect for us, the Senate, far more important.	0
I really worked hard.	0
But think of it.	0
We won the Senate and we had this, like, tremendous victory.	0
We get no credit at all.	0
Wait until you see what happens.	0
"They say, ""Donald Trump suffered a humiliating defeat."""	0
"I said, ""I wasn't running."""	0
[Laughter]	0
"And one of the commentators -- and I appreciate it -- one of the shows where they were saying how I suffered a defeat, this commentator said, ""Excuse me, he didn't run."""	0
You know, not all our candidates were exactly great.	0
Let's face it.	0
You know, you can only do so much.	0
But wait until you see what's happening when I do run.	0
And what they don't say is -- governor of Ohio, great guy.	0
Mike.	0
Mike.	0
Mike was down six.	0
He won by seven with one day.	0
Right?	0
He was down by six.	0
One day into the election, I went out, I campaigned, worked hard, made a speech.	0
Jim Jordan was there.	0
Everybody was there.	0
It was a fantastic crowd like this.	0
Like this.	0
And all the people in the other ballrooms that are waiting for us.	0
And he ended up winning.	0
He was down by six; he won by seven.	0
One day.	0
Then we have Georgia -- the governor of Georgia.	0
Great guy.	0
Where's Georgia?	0
Great guy.	0
He was losing in the primary by 10.	0
I got a call from David Perdue and Sonny Perdue -- two great guys.	0
Could you endorse him?	0
"I said, ""Let me check."""	0
And I checked him.	0
He was a Trumper before Trump was a Trumper.	0
[Laughter]	0
"And I said, ""I love this guy."""	0
He's down by 10.	0
He won by 40.	0
Can you believe that?	0
I endorsed him, Mark.	0
He won by 40.	0
Then he had a tough race against the new star of the Democrat Party -- not Democratic.	0
It's Democrat.	0
We have to do that.	0
"You know, it sounds prettier when we use ""Democratic."""	0
"I even like -- I hate to say in the speech, the ""Democrat Party"" because it doesn't sound good."	0
But that's all the more reason I use it, because it doesn't.	0
[Laughter]	0
They should change it because it sounds much better.	0
Rhetorically, it's much better.	0
Much better.	0
But then, he had an election against their star who followed me after the State of the Union Address.	0
I didn't think she was great.	0
But she's their star.	0
And who showed up?	0
Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama, and President Obama.	0
[Audience Boos]	0
And they campaigned for her, and they worked so hard.	0
And all our man had was Trump.	0
[Laughter]	0
And we kicked their ass.	0
True.	0
We had a rally at the airport, where 55,000 people showed up to the airport.	0
It was one hangar.	0
They had three other hangars that were full.	0
They went so far back.	0
The problem was they gave the press, like these guys -- they gave the press too good a location because the people behind them couldn't see properly.	0
I was so angry.	0
But we had 55,000 people show up.	0
"I said, ""You're going to win the election."""	0
He won the election.	0
He won it fairly easily, against their star.	0
And now David Perdue is going to win for senator in 2020.	0
And then -- and then we had Florida, and many others.	0
And we have a candidate, Ron DeSantis -- a friend.	0
A friend of many of us in this room.	0
But nobody knew he was running.	0
He was running against, in the primary, somebody that was easily going to win.	0
He was scheduled to be the next governor of Florida.	0
But Ron has been great to me on the witch hunt.	0
He's been a defender of me against these phony charges of Russia.	0
Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia.	0
"My wife said, ""You never spoke to anybody from Russia, darling."""	0
"I said, ""That's right."""	0
[Laughter]	0
But Ron DeSantis -- I like people that defend me.	0
You know, when people defend me, I defend them.	0
So he came.	0
That's why I like Mark.	0
That's why I like Mark Levin.	0
And I'm not sure a lot of people like him.	0
He's tough as hell.	0
But I like him.	0
I love him.	0
But then we have Florida.	0
So, Ron DeSantis is at three.	0
Three.	0
"He calls up, ""Sir, can I have your endorsement?"""	0
"I said, ""Ron, you're at three."	0
Your opponent is, I guess, agriculture commissioner -- has 22 million in the bank.	0
His poll numbers are very good.	0
"He's up in the 20s or 30s."""	0
"I said, ""Ron, don't make me do this, Ron."""	0
[Laughter]	0
Sir, I can win.	0
All right, Ron.	0
Here we go.	0
Because I know if he loses -- which almost never happens when I endorse somebody.	0
Almost never.	0
Only one time, and that was because it was done in the middle of the day of the election.	0
Nobody knew I did it.	0
"They got home, they said, ""I didn't know Trump endorsed him."""	0
But we rarely, rarely lose.	0
"But I said, ""Ron, don't do it."""	0
"I said, ""All right, I'll do it."""	0
He went from 3 to 60.	0
To 60.	0
And then he ran against a guy who had unbelievable support.	0
He had every celebrity go into Florida.	0
He had money all over the place.	0
And Ron was in there pitching, and I was in there pitching with him.	0
And we now have a great governor in the state of Florida.	0
And I could mention many others -- other governors, many other states.	0
But I'm not going to bore you with it.	0
And I think -- I really think that it's incredible what we did in the midterms.	0
I think it's incredible.	0
Governor of Florida.	0
Governor of Ohio.	0
"Remember, ""You can't win unless you win the state of Ohio."""	0
We got the governor of Ohio, and he's great.	0
Mike.	0
We love you, Mike.	0
As we defend American values at home, we are also defending.	0
American security abroad.	0
We have secured all sorts of funding, all sorts of record everything.	0
And we will never forget our military.	0
We will never forget our veterans.	0
We are taking care of our veterans like they've never been taken care of before.	0
We just got them Choice, so now they can go see a doctor.	0
Now they can go and see a doctor instead of waiting on line for weeks and weeks and weeks.	0
And we got them Accountability.	0
You couldn't fire anybody in the VA. You had sadists.	0
You had people that took advantage of our veterans.	0
They've hit them.	0
They were sadists.	0
They were sick people.	0
You couldn’t fire them.	0
You had thieves that were stealing -- openly stealing.	0
You couldn't fire them.	0
I got a bill passed: VA Accountability.	0
"Now you look at the guy, you say, ""Get the hell out of here."	0
You're fired.	0
"Get out."""	0
Nobody thought we could get it.	0
For 40 years they tried to get it.	0
For 40 years they tried to get it; they couldn't get it.	0
And VA Choice, they thought -- for many, many decades they'd been trying to get VA Choice.	1
You couldn’t get it.	0
Now, instead of waiting on line for two days, nine days, three weeks -- people were dying.	0
People that weren't very sick would be dead by the time they saw a doctor, six weeks later.	0
Now these great veterans, if there's a big wait, they go outside, they go to a local doctor.	0
We pay the bills.	0
They get better.	0
Everybody is happy.	0
And we actually save a lot of money, if you can believe it.	0
And I got that approved after 44 years of being unable to get it approved -- for our veterans.	1
We love our veterans.	0
And just in finishing up, as you know, I just returned from Vietnam, where I had very productive meetings with Chairman Kim Jong Un.	0
Very productive.	0
We get along.	0
We've developed a good relationship -- very good -- and made great historic progress.	0
"And I do get a kick out of all these people in previous administrations: ""Donald Trump should not, under any circumstances, be doing this or that."""	0
You know, they're telling me how to negotiate.	0
These guys died.	0
One administration gave billions of dollars to him and got nothing.	0
And we haven't given him anything yet.	0
I look forward to maybe doing something at some point.	0
But I know one thing: I'm going to get other countries to give.	0
Maybe not us, but I'm going to get other countries to give, and if it all works out.	0
If it all works out.	0
But I had to walk.	0
Because every once in a while, you have to walk, because the deal wasn't a deal that was acceptable to me.	0
I don't like these deals that politicians make.	0
They make a deal just for the sake of doing it.	0
I don't want to do that.	0
I want to make a deal that either works, or let's not make it.	0
But the one thing we have, though, is we have no testing, no missiles going up, no rockets going up.	0
No nuclear testing.	0
We got our great people back.	0
We get our great, great people.	0
And that includes our beautiful, beautiful Otto -- Otto Warmbier -- whose parents I've gotten to know, who's incredible.	0
And I'm in such a horrible position, because in one way I have to negotiate.	0
In the other way, I love Mr. and Mrs. Warmbier, and I love Otto.	0
And it's a very, very delicate balance.	0
He was a special young man.	0
And to see what happened was so bad.	0
It was so bad.	0
And a lot of what I do with respect to North Korea, and any success that we hopefully have -- and we've had a lot.	0
We're given no credit.	0
They don't remember that, in the last days of the Obama administration, rockets were flying all over the place, nuclear testing was going on.	0
Mountains were being -- these are big mountains.	0
They were being shoved over three, four inches.	0
People thought it was massive earthquakes, then they found out, no, that was nuclear weapons -- nuclear testing.	0
So much.	0
We're getting the remains back of a lot of our soldiers from many, many years ago.	0
Mike Pence was in Hawaii.	0
It was one of the most beautiful ceremonies.	0
We've made a lot of progress, and we'll continue to make progress.	0
And I really think what we're doing there is very important.	0
But we actually had to walk, but I think we had a very good meeting.	0
In fact, when I came home, they put out a statement that, actually, they were willing to do much less on the sanction front.	0
But you see, that's not what happened there.	0
So already, I think we're negotiating.	0
And I'll tell you this: North Korea has an incredible, brilliant economic future, if they make a deal.	0
But they don't have any economic future if they have nuclear weapons.	0
It's really a bad thing for them.	0
So we'll see how it all goes.	0
But I think it's going well.	0
I think we learned a lot over the last couple of days.	0
And again, the relationship seems to be very, very strong.	0
And that's an important thing, especially when we're dealing with this kind of a situation.	0
For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America.	0
You saw that.	0
Would you like to apologize?	0
No.	0
I'm not apologizing.	0
Now you have a President who is standing up for America.	0
After decades of building up foreign nations, we are finally building up our nation, and we are doing it with American hands, American grit, and with beautiful, beautiful American steel.	0
We are fighting to ensure that every young American inherits the same blessings and the same boundless opportunity that our ancestors fought to secure with all of their heart, might, and soul.	0
Now more than ever, we need the proud men and women of CPAC.	0
And I want to thank everybody here, because it is incredible.	0
Your organization is incredible.	0
Matt and Mercedes, incredible.	0
You're energized, you're mobilized, and you're engaged.	0
We need your voice.	0
We need your patriotism.	0
We need your commitment.	0
We need your incredible spirit on the Fourth of July.	0
We are having, in Washington, D.C., a great tribute to America.	0
I hope you can all come.	0
Fourth of July -- keep it open.	0
We want to bring millions of people into the city, and we want people to come who love our country.	0
Those are the people we want.	0
The Fourth of July.	0
A salute to America.	0
Now is the time to embrace the promise of our history.	0
Now is the time to defend our American legacy.	0
And now is the time to seize our glorious destiny.	0
And, by the way, I'm watching those doors.	0
Not one person has left, and I've been up here a long time.	0
[Laughter]	0
"I said, ""Matt, is that okay?"""	0
"He said, ""I love it."	0
"Don't leave."""	0
But not one person.	0
"So if you hear tomorrow, when they read ""people left"" -- nobody left early."	0
There hasn't been one person that's left.	0
"But when you read it, you just say ""fake news."""	0
This magnificent nation will always be the home of those who cherish life, who love liberty, and who defend the sacred rights given to us by Almighty God.	0
Together, we are one people, one family, and one nation, forever united behind one great American flag.	0
Thank you to everybody in this room and to all of the other rooms, all over the campus and all over the country.	0
We're hooked in all over the country.	0
Thank you very much.	0
I want to thank CPAC.	0
What a job they've done.	0
What a job Matt Schlapp and his family have done in such a short period of time, in bringing this to a level like it's never been before.	0
God bless you.	0
God bless the United States of America.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Well, here's the presidential seal.	0
There is the White House and inside the White House is the President of the United States, Donald Trump.	0
And why would you be bringing that up, Ainsley?	0
He joins us now by phone.	0
Thank you so much for being with us, Mr. President.	0
Well, good morning, and I picked a very, very special day because it's Melania's birthday, so I said let's do it on Melania's birthday.	0
So, happy birthday to Melania.	0
All right.	0
Hopefully, they'll be visits in between but have you decided on or do you want to tell us what you got her?	0
Well, I better not get into that because I may get in trouble.	0
Maybe I didn't get her so much.	0
I'll tell you what.	0
She has done -- a got her a beautiful card.	0
You know, I'm very busy --	0
At this point --	0
-- to be running out looking for presents, OK?	0
But I got her a beautiful card and some beautiful flowers.	0
And she did a fantastic job with France.	0
I'll tell you what, the people of France are just -- were spellbound by what happened with their great president who just left, Emmanuel, and he is a wonderful guy and --	0
You guys really got along great.	0
-- with a wonderful wife.	0
Well, we did and --	0
You guys got along great.	0
We did and, you know, they are both terrific people.	0
And, Brigitte -- and we had a fantastic time.	0
And much more importantly, we accomplished a lot.	0
We really accomplished a lot.	0
More than anybody knows.	0
You'll be seeing what we accomplished.	0
Well, give us a hint.	0
Give us a hint.	0
Well, I think we really came to recognize the -- you know, I can say it from my standpoint but he is viewing, I believe, Iran a lot differently than he did before he walked into the Oval Office and I think that's important.	0
He understands where I'm coming from with respect to Iran.	0
Iran is a real problem for this country.	0
The president made a horrible deal.	0
When I say the president, I'm talking about past administration made a horrible deal giving $150 billion, giving $1.8 billion in cash -- in actual cash carried out in barrels and in boxes from airplanes.	1
It's inconceivable -- $1.8 billion.	0
And all they do is scream death to America, death to America.	1
And by the way, they're not screaming it so much anymore.	0
They were screaming it with him.	0
They don't scream it with me.	0
We haven't seen their little boats circling our ships in the ocean lately because they know if they do circle the ships they're not going to be there very longer.	0
All right, I want to come back to that a little later because we do want to see if that -- because you have a big deadline coming up with the Iranian agreement.	0
I do.	0
But --	0
I do.	0
-- when it comes to Ronny --	0
Your call.	0
-- Jackson, the word came out from John Roberts --	0
Yes.	0
-- now confirmed that he is no longer going to be a candidate to lead the V.A.	0
In his statement is this.	0
The allegations against me are completely false and fabricated.	0
If they had any merit, I would not have been selected, promoted, and trusted to serve in such a sensitive and important role as physician to three presidents over 12 years.	0
In my role as a doctor, I have tirelessly worked to provide excellent care for all my patients.	0
In doing so, I have always adhered to the highest ethical standards.	0
Last night the report was you had a huddle.	0
Is that what you decided last night?	0
Is that what all of you decided?	0
Well, I even told him a day or two ago.	0
I saw where this was going.	0
And, you know, they're very upset because Mike Pompeo who was again, first in his class at West Point, top in his class at Harvard Law School.	0
A brilliant guy, a great guy, and somebody I get along with very well.	0
You know, Mike got through and they thought they had him stopped.	0
The Democrats are obstructionists.	0
It's horrible what they're doing.	0
They're not approving people.	0
They're taking them out to the maximum 30 hours.	0
That's a lot of time -- 30 hours -- to interview people that are going to be approved.	0
I mean, they go 30 hours and then people will vote, and it's a disgrace.	0
In fact, they had a report the other day that at this rate it will be nine years before --	0
It's unbelievable.	0
-- they're allowed to come into government.	0
So you have that have given up everything.	0
They've given up their jobs.	0
Top-line people -- brilliant people.	0
They want to come in and help us in government and Chuck Schumer and the group take, you know, years to approve them -- years.	0
We have judges that are waiting.	0
Top of the line people.	0
The best people in our country and --	0
And by the way, they're going to be approved but they take them out until the very, very end.	0
And they said over nine years before they get approved --	0
Mr. President --	0
-- because they're using every little trick in the book.	0
-- Mitch McConnell could keep them seven days a week until they reach their 30 hours and make them, these men and women, stay until this gets done.	0
Why won't he do that?	0
Well, he should be doing that and I think he will be doing that.	0
And he should be doing that.	0
Honestly, the Republicans -- look, we have some absolute warriors.	0
We have -- when I -- I just watched your show.	0
Jim Jordan, and Mark Meadows, and Matt Gaetz, and DeSantis, and so many -- Corey Lewandowski.	0
We have people -- Diamond and Silk are warriors, by the way.	0
How about Diamond and Silk?	0
They've become amazing.	0
You know, that started off like somebody was talking about them on the Internet.	0
They were these two women -- these two beautiful, wonderful, women.	0
And I said well, let me check it out.	0
It took me about two seconds to say start them -- it's incredible.	0
So, Diamond and Silk, these are all warriors.	0
We have great people in the Republican Party and I think that, in one way, it's showing how bad, how obstructionist these Democrats are.	0
It's a disgrace what's happening.	0
Do you think the obstructionist window -- as Dr. Jackson says, these allegations are baseless and they're just attacking him?	0
This is not true, he served our country but yet, he's still withdrawing his name.	0
So does the obstructionist win when your nominees don't fight back?	0
Well, I could say yes.	0
I can also say no because Doc Ronny -- you know, we call him Doc Ronny, we call him Admiral Ronny.	0
He's an admiral, highly respected, a real leader.	0
And I watched what Jon Tester of Montana, a state that I won by like over 20 points.	0
You know, really, they love me and I love them.	0
And I want to tell you that Jon Tester -- I think this is going to cause him a lot of problems in his state.	0
He took a man who was just an incredible man -- an incredible man respected by President Obama.	0
He gave him his highest rating.	0
You saw what President Obama said.	0
Yes.	0
President Bush -- he was the doctor to President Bush, to President Obama and the family.	0
He's been my doctor.	0
And he runs a fantastic operation.	0
You know, they have many doctors and they run a fantastic operation.	0
And honestly, I said it to him.	0
He didn't come to me.	0
I said, you know, Doc, you run a great operation.	0
How do you think you'd do at the V.A.	0
?	0
Now, we can talk about experience but the V.A.	0
-- when you think about 13 million people --	0
Sure.	0
-- you could take the head of the biggest hospital corporation of the world and it's peanuts compared to the V.A., so nobody has experience, you know.	0
It's a big monster.	0
And I'm really proud of the job we've done for the V.A.	0
because we got -- we're working right now on Choice and really big -- but we got rid of so many rules and regulations that made it impossible and we're really doing great at the V.A.	0
Right.	0
But I want somebody that's going to be great.	0
He would've done a great job --	0
Did --	0
He's got a tremendous heart.	0
Any idea who you might --	0
You know, these are all false accusations that were made.	0
These are false and they're trying to destroy a man.	0
By the way, I did say welcome to Washington.	0
Welcome to the swamp.	0
Welcome to the world of politics.	0
Sure.	0
But for Jon Tester to start bringing up stuff like candy man and the kind of things he was saying, and then say well, you know, these are just statements that are made.	0
Right.	0
There's no proof of this.	0
And he has a perfect record.	0
He's got this beautiful record unblemished.	0
His son is a wonderful boy.	0
Goes to Annapolis, at the top of his class.	0
One of the finest cadets.	0
For him to be doing this to this man and this family, I think Jon Tester has to have a big price to pay in Montana because I don't think people in Montana -- the admiral is the kind of person that they respect and admire and they don't like seeing what's happened to him.	0
Well, the admiral has officially thrown in the towel.	0
Any idea who you might nominate next?	0
I do, actually, but I better not give it.	0
Maybe we'll do it on my next call.	0
I do -- I think we're going to have somebody great.	0
All right.	0
Somebody that's more -- you know, look, the admiral is not a politician which is what I liked, by the way.	0
Is your nominee somebody in politics right now?	0
Somebody with political capability, yes.	0
All right.	0
Meanwhile, let's talk a little bit about your former FBI director James Comey, who you fired.	0
Right.	0
He was on T.V.	0
last night.	0
He said --	0
I did a great thing for the American people by firing him.	0
Well, he says he's not a leaker.	0
He disputed what Anderson Cooper had said.	0
But what's interesting is we've learned through Catherine Herridge's reporting is that apparently the guy he gave the secret memos to, Dr. Richman at Columbia University -- he had this special government employee status where he had -- you know, he could look at secrets.	0
He had a badge to the building.	0
And also, apparently, the memos were leaked to a wider group of people or at least two, maybe three, including former U.S. attorney Patrick Fitzgerald.	0
Your opinion on what Mr. Comey is doing on his book tour and the fact that he had a special friend at Columbia University with an FBI badge.	0
Look, Comey is a leaker and he's a liar and not only on this stuff.	0
He's been leaking for years.	0
He's probably been using his friend, the so-called professor who now turns out to have FBI clearance, which he never said.	0
He even lied about that because he never said that in Congress.	0
He said he gave it to a friend and he gave it to a friend to leak classified information.	0
It's all classified.	0
It was totally classified.	0
So illegally -- he did an illegal act and he said it himself in order to get a special counsel against me.	0
So the special counsel -- and by the way, and Intelligence Committee and everybody else has found no collusion.	0
There's no collusion with me and the Russians.	0
Nobody's been tougher to Russia --	0
Right.	0
-- than I am.	0
You can ask President Putin about that.	0
There's been nobody.	0
Between the military and the oil and all of the other things that I've done -- the aluminum tax.	0
They send us a lot of aluminum and I put tariffs on aluminum coming in.	0
The 60 people that we sent out -- the 60 so-called diplomats.	0
Nobody's been tougher.	0
Nobody's even been close to as tough as me and we hear this nonsense.	0
So there's no collusion whatsoever.	0
Well, Comey -- what he did, Brian, was terrible.	0
He leaked classified information in order to try and get a special counsel --	0
He says it wasn't classified, Mr. President.	0
He says it wasn't classified.	0
Oh, it's -- well, it's totally classified.	0
And he also leaked the memos which are classified.	0
Nobody unclassified them.	0
And those memos were about me and they're phony memos.	0
He didn't write those memos accurately.	0
He put a lot of phony stuff.	0
For instance, I went to Russia for a day or so -- a day or two because I own the Miss Universe pageant.	0
So, I went there to watch it because it was near Moscow.	0
So I go to Russia -- now, I did go there -- everybody knows.	0
The locks are there, the planes are there.	0
He said I didn't stay there a night.	0
Of course, I stayed there.	0
I stayed there a very short period of time but, of course, I stayed.	0
Well, his memo said I left immediately.	0
I never said that.	0
I never said I left immediately.	0
So he said -- and you know, the funny thing, he does these memos and then fake news CNN who's a total fake -- you know, they give Hillary Clinton the questions to the debate and nobody -- can you imagine, by the way, if you gave me the questions to a debate?	0
They would have you out of business --	0
Yes.	0
-- and they'd have me -- you better get out of this campaign.	0
They don't even bring it up.	0
I mean, CNN - fake news CNN actually gave the questions to the --	0
Yes, but don't worry about them.	0
I want to ask you --	0
No, no -- no, no, but think of it.	0
How bad is that?	0
So anyway -- so Comey leaked and, by the way, also what he did with CNN in order to placate them, you saw that whole scenario.	0
This is a big mistake, this book.	0
He is guilty of crimes and if we had a Justice Department that was doing their job instead of spending $8 million trying to find --	0
It's your Justice Department.	0
Mr. President -- Mr. President, you're the Republican in charge --	0
You're right, yes, you're right.	0
You've got a Republican running it.	0
But here's what -- I answer this all the time.	0
Because of the fact that they have this witch hunt going on with people in the Justice Department that shouldn't be there -- they have a witch hunt against the President of the United States going on -- I've taken the position -- and I don't have to take this position and maybe I'll change -- that I will not be involved with the Justice Department.	0
I will wait until this is over.	0
It's a total -- it's all lies and it's a horrible thing that's going on.	0
Yes.	0
A horrible thing and yet, I've accomplished, with all of this going on, more than any president in the first year in our history.	0
And everybody --	0
OK.	0
Even the enemies and the haters admit that.	0
Right.	0
We have accomplished more than any president in the first year, by far.	0
If you look at regulations, and the big tax cuts, and Judge Gorsuch -- so many things -- and many other judges.	0
But the big thing -- the tax cuts, the regulations -- nobody's done what we've done -- what I've done despite what's going on.	0
So I'm very disappointed in my Justice Department but because of the fact that it's going under, and I think you'll understand this, I have decided that I won't be involved.	0
I may change my mind at some point because what's going on is a disgrace.	0
It's an absolute --	0
All right.	0
-- disgrace.	0
And by the way, the only collusion is the collusion with the Democrats and the Russians.	0
You take a look at what's going on there.	0
They wouldn't even give their server -- the DNC, Democratic National Committee, wouldn't even give its server to the FBI.	0
So what kind of an FBI -- they break down doors for Paul Manafort early in the morning.	0
His wife is in bed like at five or six in the morning.	0
And they undo the lock for Michael Cohen early in the morning.	0
And yet, they walk into the DNC and they won't give them the server.	0
They said we're not giving you the server.	0
Oh, OK, we'll leave.	0
That's not the FBI.	0
That's a fix.	0
Let's talk about Michael Cohen.	0
Yesterday, through his attorney, he's going to be taking the Fifth.	0
What's your reaction to that being that you worked with him for a couple of decades --	0
I did.	0
He --	0
-- as your attorney.	0
He's a good person.	0
He's a great guy.	0
What's at stake for you, Mr. President?	0
Brian, you know Michael.	0
Michael's been on your show, I'm sure, a lot.	0
You know, Michael --	0
We know.	0
-- is a good person.	0
Let me just tell you that Michael is in business.	0
He's really a businessman at fairly big businesses, I understand.	0
And I don't know his business but this doesn't have to do with me.	0
Michael is a businessman.	0
He's got a business.	0
He also practices law.	0
I would say probably the big thing is his business and they're looking at something having to do with his business.	0
I have nothing to do with his business.	0
I can tell you he's a good guy.	0
He sometimes --	0
But isn't your business -- isn't his business your attorney, Mr. President?	0
I have many, many -- just so you understand, I have many attorneys.	0
I have attorneys -- sadly, I have so many attorneys you wouldn't even believe it.	0
How many -- how much of your -- Mr. President, how much of your legal work was handled by Michael Cohen?	0
Well, he has a percentage of my overall legal work -- a tiny, tiny little fraction.	0
But, Michael would represent me and represent me on some things.	0
He represents me -- like with this crazy Stormy Daniels deal he represented me.	0
And, you know, from what I see he did absolutely nothing wrong.	0
There were no campaign funds going into this --	0
Then why is he pleading the Fifth?	0
-- which would have been a problem.	0
Because he's got other things.	0
He's got businesses and from what I understand they're looking at his businesses, and I hope he's in great shape.	0
Yes.	0
But he's got businesses and his lawyers probably told him to do that.	0
But I'm not involved and I'm not involved -- and I've been told I'm not involved.	0
Right, Mr. --	0
Right.	0
That just came out of the newspapers.	0
Mr. President --	0
I've been told I'm not involved in that.	0
We want to get to Kanye West.	0
He tweeted that he loves you, that you're his brother, and --	0
He's got good taste.	0
-- the left goes ballistic.	0
What's your reaction?	0
Yes.	0
Well, they do.	0
You know, I have known Kanye a little bit and I get along with Kanye.	0
I get along with a lot of people, frankly.	0
But Kanye looks and he sees black unemployment at the lowest it's been in the history of our country, OK?	1
He sees Hispanic unemployment at the lowest it's been in the history of our country.	1
He sees, by the way, female unemployment -- women unemployment the lowest it's been in now almost 19 years.	1
He sees that stuff and he's smart.	0
And he says you know what, Trump is doing a much better job than the Democrats did.	0
And by the way, if they ever got in and started putting back all these rules and regulations where you can't breathe, where businesses go out of business, our country would be in big trouble.	0
Right.	0
And had I not gotten elected, Hillary would have come in.	0
She would have added more rules and regulations.	0
We would have been out of business because you saw what was happening.	0
We were going down.	0
Yes, and a couple of things on top of that.	0
There's a bigger picture.	0
Kanye West comes out.	0
Regardless of what he says he doesn't have anything personally against you.	0
He likes you even if he doesn't agree with everything.	0
Then he has other people in the black community.	0
Like, Chance the Rapper comes out and says black people don't have to be Democrats.	0
Have Republicans done a bad job ignoring the black community up until now?	0
You know, I think it was just a custom.	0
People don't realize, you know, if you go back to the Civil War it was the Republicans that really did the thing.	0
Lincoln was a Republican.	0
I mean, somehow it changed over the years and I will say I really believe it's changing back.	0
Remember, I was going to get no black votes?	0
Right.	0
I was going to get none?	0
Well, I got a lot.	0
I got a lot of support, you know, and I should have gotten much more.	0
Now -- in fact, I used to go around saying what do you have to lose?	0
I'd say that at speeches, remember?	0
I'd go into a stadium.	0
I'd talk about the African-American vote.	0
I said the education is not good.	0
The -- obviously, the law enforcement that your community -- the crime is at levels that nobody's ever seen before.	0
You know, I'd go through like seven, 10 stats.	0
I'd say vote for me.	0
What do you have to lose?	0
Right.	0
So now they've voted for me crime is way down and really importantly, the unemployment picture --	0
Yes.	0
-- is the best it's been in the history of our country for African-Americans.	0
Mr. President, what does it say though about the political discourse in this country that when somebody comes out and says I like Donald Trump, suddenly the political left goes out and destroys them?	0
Shania Twain was asked a couple of days ago about well, if you could've voted for Donald Trump would you have?	0
And she said yes, I would have.	0
And then she got so destroyed online she had to come out and apologize.	0
And then yesterday, the same thing with Kanye West.	0
Suddenly, people are saying the guy's out of his mind because he supports you.	0
What happened to being able to have a different point of view?	0
All right, I'll tell you what happened.	0
Shania, who I think is terrific but she made a mistake by sort of saying I wish I didn't, you know, go public with it, but we know how she feels.	0
But people have done that and they're amazed at what happens to their business because we have tremendous support.	0
We have tremendous fans.	0
If I ever called for a rally in Washington, D.C. we'd have millions of people coming into Washington because they love what's happening.	0
Right.	0
So when I see a Kanye sticking to his guns or when I see others, and there are plenty of others, sticking to their guns and coming out and saying that you have a young lady who's been very much in the news in the last three or four days --	0
Candace Owens.	0
-- because she is -- she is fantastic.	0
She's like the hottest thing out there now.	0
If you have people do that they become much more popular.	0
Remember, we won the election and we won it easily.	0
You know, a lot of people say oh, it was close.	0
Yes.	0
And by the way, they also like to always talk about Electoral College.	0
Well, it's an election based on the Electoral College.	0
I would rather have a popular election but it's a totally different campaign.	0
Right.	0
It's as though you're running -- if you're a runner you're practicing for the 100-yard dash as opposed to the one-mile.	0
The Electoral College is different.	0
I would rather have the popular vote because it's -- to me, it's much easier to win.	0
Yes, it's a totally different set of goals as opposed to the Electoral College.	0
Yes, but we have an Electoral College --	0
Right.	0
I got 306 and she got what, 223.	0
So, remember --	0
Yes.	0
-- there was no way to break 270.	0
All right.	0
I heard that on CBS, and NBC, and ABC.	0
They're all fake news.	0
So --	0
I heard that for so long -- and CNN.	0
But I heard that for so long.	0
There is no way.	0
So what they're trying to do is suppress the vote.	0
Everyone goes home and says you know, I really like Donald Trump but I've watched on the news -- and they don't know it's fake news.	0
I've taught them it's fake news.	0
I've watched on the news that he can't win, so let's go to a movie, darling, and then we'll come home and we'll watch --	0
And you'll find out in the midterms whether they go with the darling home or they go to the movies.	0
But I think that --	0
Let's talk about --	0
I think he'll do better than people think in the midterms.	0
Mr. President --	0
Did you know it's very --	0
Right.	0
The economy is so strong and jobs are so good that I think we're going to surprise -- you know, we won an election yesterday in Arizona.	0
Nobody talks about it.	0
They had these massive booths set up for CNN and everybody.	0
They had these big booths set up because they were hoping -- you know, they spent a fortune on the Democrat and the Republican won -- Lesko.	0
And you know what, nobody talks about it.	0
All right.	0
But, Mr. President, you can argue -- you can argue that the midterms are going to be decided on big things like a meeting that you're going to have one-one-one with Kim Jong Un.	0
How much are you looking at the summit that starts tomorrow with South Korea to look at what you're going to be doing when you sit down with North Korea?	0
And on top of that, we know this is confidential but can you give us any more information on the one-on-one that Mike Pompeo had with Kim Jong Un?	0
A lot of people are hungry for some details.	0
Well, I can.	0
First of all, we're doing very well with North Korea and we'll see how it all comes out.	0
Again, Brian, I'm not like Obama where you go in and you have a Kerry, who's the worst negotiator I've ever seen.	0
He goes in for the Iran deal, he never leaves.	0
He should've left.	0
He should've just left.	0
He would have -- could have made a much better deal.	0
But -- so it could be that I walk out quickly -- with respect, but it could be.	0
It could be that maybe the meeting doesn't even take place.	0
Who knows?	0
But I can tell you right now they want to meet.	0
They wanted to go to the Olympics.	0
Look, it was very, very nasty with Little Rocket Man and with the buttons -- and, you know, my button's bigger than -- everybody said this guy's going to get us into nuclear war.	0
Let me tell you.	0
The nuclear war would have happened if you had weak people.	0
We had weak people.	0
This should have been settled long before I came into office.	0
This is a much different ballgame than if they did it five or 10 or 20 years ago.	0
This is a much more dangerous ballgame now.	0
But I will tell you it's going very well.	0
Mike Pompeo did go there.	0
He wasn't supposed to meet with Kim Jong Un but he did.	0
He -- you know, they arranged, actually while he was there, to say hello.	0
We have incredible pictures of the two talking and meeting which I'd love to release.	0
If we can I'll do that, actually.	0
It's not a bad idea.	0
So it was just a hello, Mr. President?	0
No, it was more than a hello.	0
They got along.	0
They were with each other for, you know, more than an hour.	0
Right.	0
They spoke and he also spoke with his counterparts in North Korea.	0
They had a great meeting.	0
He then left.	0
It was very, very secret -- very, very quiet.	0
They had a great meeting -- he left.	0
And, you know, when I watch -- liked I watched sleepy eyes Chuck Todd the other day saying why is the president giving up so much and North Korea's giving up nothing?	0
This was at the beginning of Meet the Press, which, I mean, this guy shouldn't even be --	0
Right.	0
-- on the show.	0
So I said to myself well, wait a minute, I'm seeing it just the opposite.	0
I haven't given up anything.	0
I haven't even talked about it.	0
I haven't given up anything.	0
We're not giving up much.	0
When are you going to meet with him?	0
I'm not giving up much.	0
They've given up denuclearization, testing, research.	0
We're going to close different sites.	0
And I'm saying to myself, wait a minute.	0
All of these things he's given up and we haven't even really that much asked them because we would have asked them but they gave it before I even asked.	0
So I have this guy, fake news -- he's on television saying why am I giving up something?	0
I never gave up anything.	0
The people have to understand how dishonest the news is.	0
And in all fairness to Fox, you guys don't always treat me great but you treat me fairly.	0
You know, it's not like Fox is perfect for me.	0
They're not -- they're tough but at least it's fair.	0
When you look at some of the others -- you look at like a CNN, they'll have a council of seven people and of the seven people every one of them is against me.	0
I'm saying, where do we -- where do they even find these people?	0
I appreciate the --	0
I'm not your doctor, Mr. President, but I would -- I would recommend you watch less of them.	0
I don't watch them at all.	0
I watched last night.	0
Well, that makes it easy.	0
I'll tell you what.	0
I watched leaking, lying Comey last night and I did -- I did -- I hated to do it.	0
You know, one of the reasons people say you're still looking good, Mr. President.	0
How do you do it?	0
Well, one of the things I've been able to do, which is something I never thought I had the ability -- I would always watch when I was -- now, frankly, I don't have time for two reasons.	0
There's too much and I don't have time.	0
But I would watch -- whether it's good or bad, I'd always watch.	0
I have an ability -- I don't watch NBC anymore.	0
They're as bad as CNN.	0
I don't -- and by the way, I made them a fortune with THE APPRENTICE.	0
Think of that one.	0
I made them -- and I did 19 episodes.	0
Your alma mater.	0
No, but I made them a fortune.	0
Right.	0
You would think that these guys would treat me great.	0
I made them a fortune.	0
So they treat me horribly --	0
OK.	0
-- and they treat me falsely.	0
But just one thing.	0
I don't watch things now.	0
I can put it out of my mind and I never, ever thought that that would be possible.	0
And you know what that does?	0
It keeps you on the ball.	0
It keeps you -- you keep your sanity and it works very well.	0
But last night I did watch --	0
Mr. President, I have one question.	0
I did watch a liar-leaker and his performance, by the way, was horrible.	0
And I will say this.	0
Anderson Cooper was surprisingly tough and he did a good job.	0
He did.	0
Mr. President, real quickly, have you decided on a date to meet with Kim Jong Un?	0
We have a decision to be made.	0
We have three or four dates and that includes --	0
Right.	0
-- locations.	0
We have five locations --	0
Great.	0
-- and that will all be narrowed down.	0
I can only say this.	0
When I came into office people thought we were going into nuclear war, OK, and now they're saying wow --	0
Right.	0
-- it looks like that's going to be taken care.	0
Mr. President --	0
I think we're doing very well.	0
Let's see what happens.	0
OK. We're running out of time but when we came down after your first month in office and we did that big famous now interview in the East Room --	0
Right.	0
-- Ainsley asked you a question to grade your first month in office.	0
Now, fast-forward.	0
You've been in office over a year.	0
Last year, you said in the first month I give myself an A for effort and a C for messaging because you were having trouble -- the White House was -- explaining what you were doing.	0
How would you grade yourself now?	0
Look, I'm fighting a battle against a horrible group of deep-seated people -- drained the swamp -- that are coming up with all sorts of phony charges against me, and they're not bringing up real charges against the other side.	0
So we have a phony deal going on and it's a cloud over my head.	0
And I've been able to do -- to really escape that cloud because the message now everyone knows -- it's a fix, OK.	0
It's a witch hunt and they know that and I've been able to message it.	0
I would give myself an A+.	0
Nobody has done --	0
Right.	0
-- what I've been able to do and I did it despite the fact that I have a phony cloud over my head that doesn't exist.	1
It was what the Democrats used to try and make an excuse for their loss of an election -- for their loss of the Electoral College that they should never lose because the Electoral College is set up perfectly for the Democrats and this was an absolute total beating in the Electoral College.	1
They should never lose the Electoral College and they did --	0
But --	0
-- and they got thwamped.	0
But does it make you want to talk to Mueller and put an end to it?	0
Does it make you want to talk to him because that's what Rudy Giuliani --	0
Well, if I can.	0
The problem is that it's such a -- it's such -- if you take a look they're so conflicted.	0
The people that are doing the investigation -- you have 13 people that are Democrats.	1
You have Hillary Clinton people.	1
You have people that worked on Hillary Clinton's foundation.	0
They're all -- I don't mean Democrats, I mean like the real deal.	0
And then you look at the phony Lisa Page and Strzok and the memos back and forth, and the FBI.	0
And by the way, you take a poll at the FBI.	0
I love the FBI, the FBI loves me.	0
But the top people in the FBI, headed by Comey, were crooked.	0
You look at McCabe where he takes $700,000 from somebody supporting Hillary Clinton.	0
He takes $700,000 for his wife's campaign.	0
And by the way, didn't even spend that money.	0
They kept some of it because under that law you're -- he took seven.	0
He took $700,000 from a group headed by Terry McAuliffe who was under investigation by McCabe and the FBI and that investigation disappeared.	0
He took $700,000.	0
And you look at the corruption at the top of the FBI.	0
It's a disgrace.	0
And our Justice Department, which I try and stay away from, but at some point I won't.	0
OK.	0
Our Justice Department should be looking at that kind of stuff, not the nonsense of collusion with Russia.	0
There is no collusion with me --	0
All right.	0
All right.	0
-- and Russia, and everyone knows it.	0
Everyone.	0
We could talk to you all day but it looks like --	0
Sure.	0
-- you have a million things to do.	0
Well, you could have --	0
But I hope you can join us again, Mr. President.	0
Thank you so much for much for being with us.	0
And, Ainsley, good luck with your book.	0
It's going to be a winner.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you so much.	0
And happy birthday to Melania.	0
Thank you very much.	0
We'll see you next Thursday, Mr. President.	0
OK, thank you.	0
The phone line's open.	0
Sounds OK.	0
Call in again some time.	0
Thank you.	0
Good.	0
Thank you, bye.	0
Very nice of you to call in.	0
[ Speaking in Spanish ]	0
[ through translator ]	0
This will be the first and only debate the candidates will do, taking into account the millions of [	0
inaudible ] voters	0
[ inaudible ]	0
Univision News, together with the Washington Post.	0
[ through translator ]	0
Here with us tonight is Karen Tumulty, Washington Post correspondent	0
[ inaudible ]	0
specialized in national policy.	0
Welcome, Karen.	0
[ through translator ]	0
Now, we're going to welcome the protagonists of this debate.	0
First, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.	0
[ applause ]	0
And Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.	0
[ applause ]	0
Welcome to both of you.	0
Thank you for being here.	0
[ Speaking in Spanish ]	0
[ through translator ]	0
Welcome to both of you.	0
[ through translator ]	0
But before we continue, we want to welcome Sebastian de la Cruz who is going to sing the national anthem.	0
Sebastian, welcome.	0
Good evening.	0
[ The National Anthem is performed. ]	0
[ applause ]	0
[ commercial break ]	0
[ through translator ]	0
Thank you for being with us.	0
The Washington Post and Facebook, these are the results of this debate that the candidates have accepted.	0
They will have 90 seconds to answer each question.	0
When their rival mentions them in an answer, they will have 30 seconds to answer and another 30 seconds to answer questions, follow-up questions that we ask.	0
[ through translator ]	0
We will make our questions in English and they will be translated simultaneously into Spanish for our viewers.	0
And right now, each one of them has one minute for your initial words.	0
We begin with Secretary Clinton.	0
Thank you very much.	0
I've been looking forward to this debate, and I want to thank Univision, the Washington Post, Facebook and Miami-Dade College, the largest college in North America for hosting us here this evening.	0
[ applause ]	0
And tonight I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how we knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying ahead, starting with the economic ones.	0
My focus is on more good paying jobs with rising incomes for families and how we prevent corporations from taking jobs out of our country by imposing an exit tax, making them pay back any tax breaks they've gotten.	0
But we also need to be having a positive agenda for manufacturing.	0
for small businesses and entrepreneurs, for more clean energy jobs.	0
And I also look forward to discussing comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship that will be one of my priorities in my first 100 days as president.	0
And I will also be talking about education, every child deserves a good teacher and a good school.	0
Thank you, Secretary.	0
And so thank you for having us, and I look forward to the debate.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you.	0
Senator Sanders, your opening remarks.	0
Thank you — thank you all very much.	0
I'm running for president of the United States because given the crises facing our country, it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.	0
Together we're going to have to overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision.	0
[ applause ]	0
Billionaires and Wall Street should not be buying elections.	0
We've got to end this rigged economy where people are working longer hours for low wages, almost all new income and wealth going to the top 1 percent, and of course, we need comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship.	0
And here in Miami...	0
[ applause ]	0
...here in Miami as much as any city in America, we know that we have got to combat climate change, transform our energy system, and leave this planet in a way that is healthy and habitable for our kids and our grandchildren.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
First question, Secretary, you have been starting to sound like the nominee lately, but many voters are saying, not so fast.	0
Where did you fail last night in Michigan?	0
Well, look, I won one of the contests and lost another close one.	0
I am continuing to work hard for every single vote across our country.	0
I was pleased that I got 100,000 more votes last night than my opponent and more delegates.	0
So this is a marathon, and it's a marathon that can only be carried out by the kind of inclusive campaign that I'm running, a campaign that reaches out to everybody, a campaign that offers real positive solutions to the problems that we face, a campaign that is based on how together we can make progress, because I am a progressive who likes to get things done.	0
So I'm excited about the upcoming contests, including right here in Florida.	0
And we'll continue to work as hard as I can to earn the vote of every single voter.	0
What went wrong in Michigan?	0
[ applause ]	0
What went wrong in Michigan?	0
What went wrong in Michigan?	0
What failed in Michigan specifically?	0
It was a very close race.	0
We've had some of those.	0
I've won some.	0
I've lost some.	0
But, you know, I was very pleased by the overall outcome last night.	0
And now we're on to the states for next Tuesday and I'm looking forward to campaigning hard in all of them.	0
Senator, aside from your astounding upset last night in Michigan, you are still far behind Secretary Clinton in delegate count.	0
She has 1,221 delegates, including superdelegates, and you have 571.	0
What is your pathway to make up the deficit, and can you realistically catch up?	0
Well, you know, when we began this campaign, I was 3% in the polls.	0
I was probably 60 or 70 points behind the Secretary.	0
We have come a long way in 10 months.	0
We have won...	0
[ applause ]	0
...including Michigan last night, which some people,considered one of the major political upsets in modern American history.	0
We have won nine state primaries and caucuses.	0
And I believe that our message of the need for people to stand up and tell corporate America and Wall Street that they cannot have it all is resonating across this country.	0
And I think in the coming weeks and months, we are going to continue to do extremely well, win a number of these primaries, and convince superdelegates that Bernie Sanders is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump.	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary Clinton, I want to disclose once again that my daughter Paula works for your campaign.	0
And now I have a question about your emails.	0
Your Republican opponents say that those emails have endangered our national security.	0
When you were secretary of state, you wrote 104 emails in your private server that the government now says contain classified information according to The Washington Post analysis.	0
That goes against a memo that you personally sent to your employees in 2011 directing all of them to use official email, precisely because of security concerns.	0
So it seems that you issued one set of rules for yourself and a different set of rules for the rest of the State Department.	0
So who specifically gave you permission to operate your email system as you did?	0
Was it President Barack Obama?	0
And would you drop out of the race if you get indicted?	0
Well, Jorge, there's a lot of questions in there.	0
And I'm going to give the same answer I've been giving for many months.	0
It wasn't the best choice.	0
I made a mistake.	0
It was not prohibited.	0
It was not in any way disallowed.	0
And as I have said and as now has come out, my predecessors did the same thing and many other people in the government.	1
But here's the cut to the chase facts.	0
I did not send or receive any emails marked classified at the time.	0
What you are talking about is retroactive classification.	0
And the reason that happens is when somebody asks or when you are asked to make information public, I asked all my emails to be made public.	0
Then all the rest of the government gets to weigh in.	0
And some other parts of the government, we're not exactly sure who, has concluded that some of the emails should be now retroactively classified.	0
They've just said the same thing to former Secretary Colin Powell.	0
They have said, we're going to retroactively classify emails you sent personally.	0
Now I think he was right when he said this is an absurdity.	0
And I think that what we have got here is a case of overclassification.	0
If we get your permission...	0
I am not concerned about it.	0
I am not worried about it and no Democrat or American should be either.	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary Clinton, the questions were, who gave you permission to cooperate?	0
Was it President Obama?	0
There was no permission to be asked.	0
It had been done by my predecessors.	0
It was permitted.	0
If you get indicted would you going to drop out?	0
Oh, for goodness — that's not going to happen.	0
I'm not even answering that question.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Sanders, you have gone from saying the following, the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e- mails, to claiming that it is a very serious issue.	0
Which is it?	0
There is a process under way, and that process will take its course.	0
Today in America, the middle class is disappearing.	0
We have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, climate change threatens the whole planet, 47 million people live in poverty.	0
I'm going to focus on the issues facing the working families of this country.	0
That process specifically.	0
Secretary Clinton, you have known Donald Trump a long time.	0
You have seen what kind of campaign he's running.	0
Secretary Clinton, is Donald Trump a racist?	0
Karen, I'm going to follow my friend Senator Sanders model here.	0
If I'm so fortunate enough to be the Democratic nominee, there will be a lot of time to talk about him.	0
I was the first one to call him out.	0
I called him out when he was calling Mexicans rapists.	0
When he was engaging in rhetoric that I found deeply offensive.	0
I said basta, and I am pleased that others...	0
[ applause ]	0
...others are also joining in making clear that his rhetoric, his demagoguery, his trafficking in prejudice and paranoia has no place in our political system.	0
Especially from somebody running for president who couldn't decide whether or not to disavow the Ku Klux Klan and David Duke.	0
So people can draw their own conclusions about him.	0
I will just end by saying this.	0
You don't make America great by getting rid of everything that made America great.	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary Clinton, my question was about his character.	0
And that is one of the primary things that Americans think about when they choose their next president.	0
How would you describe the character of a person who has said the sorts of things he has about Mexican immigrants, about women, and who would ban people from entering this country based on their religion?	0
I think it's un-American.	0
I think what he has promoted is not at all in keeping with American values, Karen.	0
And I am going to take every opportunity to criticize him, to raise those issues.	0
I'm not going to engage in the kind of language that he uses.	0
I think we can make the case against him if he is the nominee, by pointing out what he has said.	0
What he claims to believe in The values he's promoting and I think that's a better way for the American people to draw their conclusions.	0
Senator Sanders, do you think it's fair to call Donald Trump a racist?	0
This is what I think.	0
I think that the American people are never going to elect a president who insults Mexicans, who insults Muslims, who insults women, who insults African-Americans.	0
And let us not forget that several years ago, Trump was in the middle of the so- called birther movement, trying to delegitimize the president of the United States of America.	0
[ applause ]	0
You know, I find it very interesting, Karen, my dad was born in Poland.	0
I know a little bit about the immigrant experience.	0
Nobody has ever asked me for my birth certificate.	0
Maybe it has something to do with the color of my skin.	0
[ applause ]	0
So what does that tell you about his character?	0
And I am very pleased — I am very pleased that I think in the last national poll that I saw, we were running 18 points ahead of Donald Trump.	0
[ applause ]	0
On	0
[ inaudible ]	0
, people are talking about immigration, and this map shows where in the country they are talking about it the most.	0
Maria Elena?	0
So Secretary, I have a question for you.	0
In 2003, you said on a radio show, specifically it was John Gambling's radio show in New York, that you were adamantly against illegal immigrants and that people have to stop employing illegal immigrants.	0
Your new immigration plan is that you would expand President Obama's executive actions and that you would push for legislation that would include a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.	0
So, are you flip-flopping on this issue?	0
Or are you pandering to Latinos, what some would call Hispandering?	0
[ laughter ]	0
In 2003, I sponsored the DREAMER Act.	0
I sponsored I think in every Congress after that.	0
I have been consistent and committed to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.	0
I think our best chance was in 2007, when Ted Kennedy led the charge on comprehensive immigration reform.	0
We have Republican support.	0
We had a president willing to sign it.	0
I voted for that bill.	0
Senator Sanders voted against it.	0
Just think, imagine where we would be today is we had achieved comprehensive immigration reform nine years ago.	0
Imagine how much more secure families would be in our country, no longer fearing the deportation of a loved one; no longer fearing that they would be found out.	0
So I am staunchly in favor of comprehensive immigration reform and have been so over the course of my public career.	0
[ applause ]	0
Now, Senator Sanders, in 2007, you voted against immigration reform.	0
You now say that it was because the bill had guestworker provisions which seemed semi-slavery.	0
But back then, this is what you said to CNN's Lou Dobbs.	0
Let's listen.	0
[ begin video clip ]	0
Poverty is increasing.	0
And if wages are going down, I don't know why we need millions of people to be coming into this country as guestworkers who will work for lower wages than American workers and drive wages down even lower than they are right now.	0
[ end video clip ]	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
So, Senator, were you concerned with working conditions for guestworkers, or really because you think immigrants drive down wages and take jobs from Americans?	0
Well, you have guestworker programs that have been described by the Southern Poverty Law Center, one of the important institutions in this country who studies these issues, as guestworkers programs akin to slavery, where people came in.	0
They were cheated.	0
They were abused.	0
They were humiliated.	0
And if they stood up for their rights, they would be thrown out of the country.	0
Of course, that type of	0
[ inaudible ]	0
leads to a race to the bottom for all of our people.	0
And I worked very hard on that issue.	0
And of course, I supported the 2013 immigration reform bill.	0
And what I believe right now is not only that we need comprehensive immigration reform, if the Congress does not do its job, as president of the United States I will use the executive powers of that office to do what has to be done, to do what President Obama did, and expand on that.	0
But if you're saying that you would...	0
[ applause ]	0
...if you're saying that you would expand on the executive actions, how do you that they're not going to end up in a legal battle just like Obama's executive actions?	0
Well, we do the best — we don't know.	0
And I should also say with regard to that 2007 immigration bill, as you may know, LULAC, the major Hispanic organization in his country, also opposed that bill as did many other Latino organizations.	0
But to your point, we have to do the best we can.	0
I applaud President Obama for his efforts on DAPA and DACA.	0
And I think we have got to expand those efforts.	0
If I could...	0
[ applause ]	0
You know, I think it's very hard to make the case that Ted Kennedy, Barack Obama, me, La Raza, United Farmworkers, Dolores Huerta, leaders of the Latino community, would have supported a bill that actually promoted modern slavery.	0
That was one of the many excuses used not to vote for the 2007 bill.	0
And I will go back to what I said.	0
If we had been able to get that passed, we would be so much further along now.	0
I'm committed to defending DAPA and DACA.	0
I'm committed to going even further to get more people deferred action, to go as far as I can under the law.	0
And I am committed to introducing comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship in the first 100 days of my presidency.	0
Secretary Sanders (sic).	0
Senator, would you like to respond?	0
Well, when we talk about efforts to assist immigrants, Secretary Clinton prevailed upon the governor of New York, Elliot Spitzer, who wanted to do the right thing and provide driver's license to these who were undocumented, she said don't do it, and New York State still does not do it.	1
In Vermont, by the way, I worked with officials and undocumented people in Vermont do have the ability to get driver's license.	0
[ applause ]	0
When we talk about immigration, the secretary will remember that one of the great tragedies, human tragedies of recent years is children came from Honduras where there's probably more violence than almost any place in this country, and they came into this country.	0
And I said welcome those children into this country, Secretary Clinton said send them back.	1
That's a difference.	0
Let me — let me respond again because the misrepresentation can't go unanswered here.	0
First of all, that is something that is not fair about what I said.	0
I did say we needed to be very concerned about little children coming to this country — on their own, very often — many of them not making it.	0
And when they got here, they needed, as I have argued for, legal counsel, due process, to make a decision.	0
We need to end private detention, we need to end family detention.	0
And in 2006, when Senator Sanders was running for the Senate from Vermont, he voted in the House with hard-line Republicans for indefinite detention for undocumented immigrants, and then he sided with those Republicans to stand with vigilantes known as Minute Men who were taking up outposts along the border to hunt down immigrants.	0
So I think when you were running for the Senate, you made it clear by your vote, Senator, that you were going to stand with the Republicans.	0
When you got to the Senate in 2007, one of the first things you did was vote against Ted Kennedy's immigration reform which he'd been working on for years before you ever arrived.	0
One last response.	0
[ applause ]	0
Let me respond — let me respond to that.	0
Go ahead.	0
You know, Ted Kennedy was a very close friend of mine, and I served on the committee he chaired, the Health, Education, Labor Committee.	0
And Ted Kennedy was kind enough to allow me to hold a hearing in 2008, I believe, in Congress, dealing with the plight of undocumented tomato pickers in Immokalee, Florida.	0
[ applause ]	0
And I went there on my own.	0
Wasn't an issue really for the state of Vermont to expose the horrendous working conditions and the semi slavery, if you like, that those workers lived under.	0
And the result of that hearing and the work that many, many people did was to significantly improve the wages and working conditions of those workers.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator, Secretary, we're going to take a break and we'll continue talking about immigration when we come back.	0
Great.	0
Thank you.	0
RAMOS	0
[ through translator ]	0
So this is the moment of talking about deportations.	0
We're going to immigrants.	0
[ through translator ]	0
[ inaudible ] Facebook page [ inaudible ]	0
Tell us what you think of the debate in the comment section.	0
We will come back after the break.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
[ through translator ]	0
We're back to the Democratic debate.	0
Secretary Clinton, the last time we talked in January, in Iowa, I asked you if you could be the next deporting chief.	0
And you told me, no, that you wouldn't be the next deporter in chief.	0
However, you refused two times to say you would not deport children.	0
This is what you said.	0
[ begin video clip ]	0
And can you promise that you won't deport immigrants who don't have a criminal record?	0
Here's what I can promise Jorge, I can promise that I will do everything possible to provide due process.	0
But will you deport children?	0
Let me say this.	0
I would give every person, but particularly children, due process to have their story told.	0
And a lot of children will, of course, have very legitimate stories under our law to be able to stay.	0
[ end video clip ]	0
So secretary, you seem to be defending President Obama's deportation policy.	0
And as you know, so far he has deported more than 2.5 million immigrants.	0
So if you really don't want to be the next deporter in chief, can you promise tonight that you won't deport children and that you won't deport immigrants who don't have a criminal record and this time, could I get a yes or no answer?	0
Yes, you can because the question you were asking me were about children seeking asylum.	0
And we have laws.	0
That was the most critical thing I said.	0
Under our laws.	0
I would like to see those laws changed.	0
I would like see added to them, a guaranteed counsel and other support for children.	0
But if you are asking about everyone who is already here, undocumented immigrants, the 11-12 million who are living here, my priorities are to deport violent criminals, terrorists, and anyone who threatens our safety.	0
So I do not have the same policy as the current administration does.	0
I think it's important that we move to our comprehensive immigration reform, but at the same time, stop the raids, stop the round-ups, stop the deporting of people who are living here doing their lives, doing their jobs, and that's my priority.	0
[ applause ]	0
But again, yes or no, can you promise tonight that you won't deport children, children who are already here?	0
I will not deport children.	0
I would not deport children.	0
I do not want to deport family members either, Jorge.	0
I want to, as I said, prioritize who would be deported: violent criminals, people planning terrorist attacks, anybody who threatens us.	0
That's a relatively small universe.	0
OK.	0
So I want to be very specific.	0
So you are telling us tonight that if you become president you won't deport children who are already here?	0
I will not.	0
And that you won't deport immigrants who don't have a criminal record?	0
That's what I'm telling you.	0
Now I don't want — because I'm not contradicting what I told you in the interview.	0
Asylum is a particular legal process.	0
I'd like to see it changed.	0
I'd like to see us give more support to people who come fleeing the terrible violence that they do.	0
But under our law, we have a process we have to go through which is different.	0
So you will stop those deportations.	0
I would stop...	0
The deportations for children...	0
Yes.	0
... and those who don't have a criminal record.	0
Of the people, the undocumented people living in our country, I do not want to see them deported.	0
I want to see them on a path to citizenship.	0
That is exactly what I will do.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Sanders, would you — can you promise us tonight that you won't deport children?	0
Let me just say this.	0
I don't think that the secretary fully answered your question, and I think the proof may be in the pudding.	0
Honduras and that region of the world may be the most violent region in our hemisphere.	0
Gang lords, vicious people torturing people, doing horrible things to families.	0
Children fled that part of the world to try, try, try, try, maybe, to meet up with their family members in this country, taking a route that was horrific, trying to start a new life.	0
Secretary Clinton did not support those children coming into this country.	0
I did.	0
Now I happen to agree with President Obama on many, many issues.	0
I think he has done a great job as president of the United States.	0
He is wrong on this issue of deportation.	0
I disagree with him on that.	0
[ applause ]	0
So to answer your question, no, I will not deport children from the United States of America.	0
And can you promise not to deport immigrants who don't have a criminal record?	0
I can make that promise.	0
[ applause ]	0
This is why I go back to that 2007 vote because if we had been successful then, a lot of the issues we are still discussing today would be in the rear-view mirror.	0
I want us to be able to achieve comprehensive immigration reform if I'm so fortunate enough to be president.	0
And we do have to take a look at asylum laws.	0
When I was secretary of state, I worked to try to support many different approaches to ending the violence in Central America.	0
I was there meeting with leaders, security leaders, and others.	0
And I think the Congress should support the president's request to fund programs that would protect people and change the culture of criminality and violence in Central America, helping people be able to stay safely in their homes and countries.	0
[ applause ]	0
Let me just answer, I want to get back to this 2007 immigration bill.	0
It's true, Ted Kennedy, a good friend of mine, and I think of the secretary's, did work very hard on that bill.	0
But does anyone really believe that if that bill was all so good, as the secretary is touting, that LULAC and other major Latino organizations, the largest Latino organizations in this country said no to that bill.	0
And I worked very hard in improving the guest worker provisions so that in 2013 a bill I strongly supported, people who were in the guest worker program in America would not be treated like slaves.	0
[ applause ]	0
Let me just conclude by saying that United Farm Workers considered that bill in their words the last best hope for farm workers and immigrants.	0
They have proven to be right in the succeeding years.	0
I only hope that we can put together a coalition to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the next Congress.	0
And as I said earlier, in 2006, Senator Sanders supported indefinite detention for people facing deportation...	0
It's...	0
"...and stood with the Minutemen vigilantes in their ridiculous, absurd efforts to, quote, ""hunt down immigrants."	0
So look, I think the goal here is to elect a Democratic Senate, elect a Democratic president and get to work immediately to get comprehensive immigration reform.	0
[ applause ]	0
Did you support the Minutemen, Senator?	0
Did you support the Minutemen?	0
I'm sorry?	0
Did you support the Minutemen, as Secretary Clinton has said?	0
Of course not.	0
There was a piece of legislation supported by dozens and dozens of members of the House which codified existing legislation.	0
What the secretary is doing tonight and has done very often is take large pieces of legislation and take pieces out of it.	0
No, I did not oppose the bailout or the support of the automobile industry.	0
No, I do not support vigilantes, and that is a horrific statement, an unfair statement to make.	0
[ applause ]	0
I will stand	0
[ inaudible ]	0
of my career, political career fighting for workers, fighting for the poorest people in this country.	0
Madame Secretary, I will match my record against yours any day of the week.	0
[ applause ]	0
Well, let's do that.	0
Let's talk about that.	0
Let's talk about that.	0
Secretary, you said this morning...	0
Let's talk about the auto bailout because I think it's important for people to understand what happened.	0
In December of 2008, we were both in the Senate, there was a vote on a free-standing bill to rescue the auto industry.	0
We both voted for it.	0
was the right vote.	0
Unfortunately, it did not succeed.	0
The Republicans marshalled the votes against it.	0
A month later, in January, a new piece of legislation was offered that contained the money that would be used for the auto rescue.	0
Then President-elect Obama — before he'd even been sworn in — sent word to all of us that he really hoped we would support it.	0
He was still in the Senate, I was still in the Senate.	0
And I voted for it.	0
It was a hard vote.	0
I'll tell you, it was a hard vote.	0
A lot of the votes you make are hard votes.	0
But the fact is the money that rescued the auto industry was in that bill.	0
Secretary...	0
Now, Senator Sanders voted against it.	0
That's his perfect right to vote against it.	0
But if everyone had voted as he voted...	0
OK, Senator.	0
Yeah, let me...	0
... we would not have rescued the auto industry.	0
You have 30 seconds and then we'll pass to another.	0
Thirty more seconds and then we'll move to another...	0
[ applause ]	0
Let me — let's — so that everybody knows, the bill that Secretary Clinton is talking about, that is — that was the bailout of the recklessness, irresponsibility and illegal behavior of Wall Street.	0
It was the Wall Street bailout.	0
[ applause ]	0
And I find it interesting that when Secretary Clinton, who was the former senator of New York, of course, when she defended her vote, she said, well, it's going to help the big banks in New York.	0
Those are my constituents.	0
And then you go to Detroit and suddenly this legislation helps the automobile workers.	0
There was an article just yesterday...	0
Your time is up, Senator.	0
... where people like Senator Bayh and Ron Wyden, Byron Dorgan...	0
Senator — your time is up, Senator.	0
...former senators said, no, this wasn't the automobile bailout.	0
It was the bailout of Wall Street.	0
Thank you.	0
We have to move on.	0
Senator, the time is up.	0
We have to move on.	0
[ applause ]	0
Next question.	0
Secretary Clinton, you recently said instead of building walls we need to tear down barriers.	0
However, last November in New Hampshire, you openly said that as senator you voted numerous times to build the wall with Mexico.	0
What's the difference between what you did, voting to build the wall, and what Donald Trump wants to do now?	0
Well, I think both of us, both Senator Sanders and I, voted numerous times to enhance border security along our border.	0
We increased the number of border security agents.	0
We did vote for money to build a fence, a pedestrian fence in some place, a vehicle fence in other places.	0
And the result is that we have the most secure border we've ever had.	0
Apprehensions coming across the border are the lowest they've been in 40 years, which just strengthens my argument that now it's time to do comprehensive immigration reform.	0
The Republicans, the opponents no longer have an argument.	0
And certainly, we hear a lot coming from the Republican side that is absolutely out of touch with reality.	0
We raised money through the congressional appropriations process.	0
We enhanced the border security.	0
That part of the work is done.	0
Everybody that I know has looked at it said, okay, we have a secure border.	0
There's no need for this rhetoric and demagoguery that's still —is carried out on the Republican side.	0
You've run out of excuses.	0
Let's move to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.	0
And I think that makes a very strong argument in favor of doing it.	0
But the question is, what is the difference between the wall that you voted for and Donald Trump's wall?	0
It's a big difference.	0
First of all, as I understand him, he's talking about a very tall wall.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Right?	0
A beautiful tall wall.	0
The most beautiful tall wall, better than the Great Wall of China, that would run the entire border.	0
That he would somehow magically get the Mexican government to pay for.	0
And, you know, it's just fantasy.	0
And in fact, if he cared to know anything about what members of Congress, like the senator and I have done, where it was necessary, we did support some fencing.	0
Where it was necessary, we did add border patrol agents.	0
"We have done what by any fair estimate would have to conclude is a good job, quote, ""securing the border""."	0
So let's get about the business of comprehensive immigration reform.	0
Let me just say...	0
Senator...	0
I think the secretary and I mostly, I think, agree on this issue.	0
Look, in this country, immigration reform is a very hot debate.	0
It's divided the country.	0
But I would hope very much, that as we have that debate, we do not, as Donald Trump and others have done, resort to racism and xenophobia and bigotry.	0
[ applause ]	0
This idea of suddenly, one day or maybe a night, rounding up 11 million people and taking them outside of this country is a vulgar, absurd idea that I would hope very few people in America support.	0
Your time is up, senator.	0
Thank you.	0
Now we have a question from the audience for both of you.	0
[ through translator ]	0
We have a question from the public.	0
I want to go to Lucia Aquiette.	0
She's an immigrant from Guatemala, she's here with her five children who have not seen their father since he was deported three years ago.	0
She has a question for both of you.	0
[ through translator ]	0
I would like to ask — me and my children — hardworking men in the field —	0
[ inaudible ]	0
Senator Sanders, as you can see, these are a very painful and personal issue for Lucia and her family.	0
She wants to know what you would do to stop deportations, but most importantly, to reunite families like hers.	0
Well, I absolutely support that.	0
At the heart of my immigration policy and I should say that the New York times editorial board called my immigration policy the most progressive and the strongest of any candidate running.	0
But to answer your question, the essence of what we are trying to do is to unite families, not to divide families.	0
[ applause ]	0
The idea that a mother is living here and her children are on the other side of the border is wrong and immoral.	0
A number of months ago, I talked to a young man who was serving in the United States military and while he was serving in the military, his wife was deported.	0
That is beyond comprehension and policies that should not be allowed to exist.	0
So, ma'am, I will do everything that I can to unite your family.	0
Your children deserve to be with their mother.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you Senator Sanders.	0
[ through translator ]	0
Secretary Clinton, you've also said you want to stop deportations.	0
But what's your plan to reunite families and thousands of children, U.S. citizens, with their parents?	0
First of all, please know how brave I think you are, coming here with your children to tell your story.	0
This is an incredible act of courage that I'm not sure many people really understand.	0
And I want you to know that in the work that I've done and the many families that I've met, I have heard similar stories like yours, where your husband is deported.	0
Your children's father is gone.	0
You are doing your very best to support your children.	0
But it is time to bring families together.	0
And I don't think there's any doubt that we must do more to let stories like yours be heard more widely so that more Americans know what the human cost of these policies are.	0
And I will do everything I can to prevent other families from facing what you are facing.	0
And I will do everything I can to pass laws that would bring families back together.	0
And I hope that your children are all either citizens born in this country or eligible for the programs that President Obama has put into place, DACA and DAPA, because I will defend those and I will absolutely protect your children, yourself, and try to bring your family back together.	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary Clinton, thank you.	0
Secretary Clinton, they are U.S. citizens	0
[ inaudible ]	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you.	0
Now let's go back to Karen.	0
Thank you, Enrique.	0
Secretary Clinton, a Washington Post poll just yesterday found that only 37 percent of Americans consider you honest and trustworthy.	0
Now, when you've been asked about this in the past, you have said that this is the result of many, many years of Republican attacks upon you.	0
But Americans have also had 25 — more than that — years to get to know you for themselves.	0
Is there anything in your own actions and the decisions that you yourself have made that would foster this kind of mistrust?	0
Well, first Karen, obviously it's painful for me to hear that.	0
And I do take responsibility.	0
When you're in public life, even if you believe that it's not an opinion that you think is fair or founded, you do have to take responsibility.	0
And I do.	0
And I also have, you know, very much committed to the best of my ability my energies and efforts to helping people.	0
That's something that I care deeply about.	0
And I will continue to do that, to demonstrate by my past actions and my present levels of commitment and plans that people can count on me.	0
That is certainly what happened to me in New York, where people got to know me.	0
They saw me in action.	0
And they did.	0
Look, I have said before and it won't surprise anybody to hear me say it, this is not easy for me.	0
It's not easy to do what I think is right, to help people, to even the odds, to hear a story like the woman's story we just heard.	0
And to know that I can make a difference and I want to in every way possible.	0
I am not a natural politician, in case you haven't noticed, like my husband or President Obama.	0
So I have a view that I just have to do the best I can, get the results I can, make a difference in people's lives, and hope that people see that I'm fighting for them and that I can improve conditions economically and other ways that will benefit them and their families.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Sanders, you have demanded that Secretary Clinton release the transcripts of her paid Wall Street speeches.	0
Why is this important?	0
Do you have reason to believe that she says one thing in private and another in public?	0
Well, what I have said is that when you get I believe it is $225,000 for giving a speech, and she gave several speeches to Goldman Sachs, one of the Wall Street financial institutions whose greed and illegal behavior helped destroy our economy a number of years ago, when you get paid $225,000, that means that that speech must have been an extraordinarily wonderful speech.	0
[ applause ]	0
So does this mean that you would not think she should have to disclose...	0
I would think that a speech so great that you got paid so much money for, you would like to share it with the American people.	0
So I think she should release the transcript.	0
[ laughter and applause ]	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
As the secretary said, well, she will do it if other people do it.	0
I will do it.	0
I didn't give any speeches, there is no transcript.	0
[ applause ]	0
But my question was, do you think she saying one thing in the speeches and another in public?	0
That is exactly what releasing the transcripts will tell us.	0
This I do know.	0
This I do know.	0
There is a reason why Wall Street has provided $15 million just in the last reporting period to the secretary's super PAC.	0
Now, the secretary says it doesn't influence her.	0
Well, that's what every politician says who gets money from special interests.	0
[ applause ]	0
The question that the American people have to determine - you know, can you say that Wall Street is greedy, they're fraudulent, but they're not dumb.	0
Why are they making those kind of large contributions?	0
Thank you, your time is up.	0
[ applause ]	0
Well, let me respond, as I have numerous times during this campaign.	0
You know, I have a public record and you can go look it up.	0
I went to Wall Street before the Great Recession and basically called them out, said that their behavior was putting our economy at risk, called for a moratorium on foreclosures.	0
I went to the Orlando area during the '08 campaign to make the same case, visiting with families who had been defrauded by mortgages, these subprime mortgages that put them and their homes at risk.	0
Thank you, Secretary Clinton.	0
I called for those changes.	0
I have been on the record and now I do have the toughest, most comprehensive plan to go after Wall Street.	0
And not just the big banks, all the other financial interests that pose a threat to our economy.	0
And I have said no bank is too big to fail and no executive is too powerful to jail, and I will use the powers that have now been passed by the Congress, by President Obama, who, incidentally, took a lot of money from Wall Street, which didn't stop him from signing into law the toughest regulations on the financial industry since the Great Depression.	0
[ applause ]	0
Look, clearly, clearly, the secretary's words to Wall Street has really intimidated them, and that is why they have given her $15 million in campaign contributions.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Now, what I believe is in fact that we have a corrupt campaign finance system.	0
And it's not just Wall Street, it's the drug companies,	0
[ inaudible ]	0
received millions of dollars from the fossil fuel industry.	0
We've got to overturn Citizens United and end that.	0
[ applause ]	0
Wait a minute.	0
I just think it's worth pointing out that the leaders of the fossil fuel industry, the Koch brothers, have just paid to put up an ad praising Senator Sanders.	0
There are a lot of different powerful interests in Washington.	0
I've taken them on.	0
I took on the drug companies.	0
I took on the insurance companies.	0
Before there was something called Obamacare, there was something called Hillarycare, and I worked really hard...	0
[ applause ]	0
...to get comprehensive health care reform, and they beat me.	0
So I have a long record of standing up to special interests.	0
And I will continue to do so.	0
We're going to move on to the next question.	0
[ booing ] [ crosstalk ]	0
[ laughter and applause ]	0
You have 30 seconds, Senator.	0
There is nobody in the United States Congress who has taken on the Koch brothers, who want to destroy Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and virtually every federal program passed since the 1930s more that Bernie Sanders.	0
[ applause ]	0
And I am proud that the gentleman who is head of Goldman Sachs, now, he didn't give me $225,000 for speaking fees, he said I was dangerous and he's right.	0
I am dangerous for Wall Street.	0
[ applause ]	0
Well, if I can say...	0
We're going to move on to the secretary.	0
... you know though, I guess Senator Sanders, that the Koch brothers, as you said, are sensible with how they use their money.	0
And I agree with you.	0
They stand for things that I find abhorrent, that would be bad for our country, bad for our future.	0
But they did just put up a little video praising you for being the only Democrat who stood with the Republicans to try to eliminate the Export/Import Bank, which has helped hundreds and hundreds of companies here in Florida be able to export their goods and employ more Floridians.	0
So from my perspective, you sided with the Koch brothers.	0
[ applause ]	0
Let me respond.	0
Yes.	0
Just a few seconds.	0
The Export/Import Bank is often called the bank of Boeing, because Boeing corporation gets 40 percent of the revenue.	0
OK. We're going to move on.	0
It is corporate welfare and yes, I oppose corporate welfare.	0
[ applause ]	0
OK, next question.	0
I want to continue with the issue of trust.	0
Secretary Clinton, on the night of the attacks in Benghazi, you sent an e-mail to your daughter Chelsea...	0
[ booing ]	0
...saying, that Al Qaida was responsible for the killing of the Americans.	0
[ booing ]	0
However, some of the families claim that you lied to them.	0
To that speed, the mother of the information officer, Chaznea.	0
Let's listen.	0
[ begin video clip ]	0
Hillary and Obama and Panetta and Biden and all of — and Susan Rice, all told me it was a video, when they knew it was not the video.	0
And they said that they would call me and let me know what the outcome was.	0
[ end video clip ]	0
Secretary Clinton, did you lie to them?	0
You know, look.	0
I feel a great deal of sympathy for the families of the four brave Americans that we lost at Benghazi.	0
And I certainly can't even imagine the grief that she has for losing her son, but she's wrong.	0
She's absolutely wrong.	0
I and everybody in the administration, all the people she named, the president, the vice president, Susan Rice, we were scrambling to get information that was changing, literally by the hour.	0
And when we had information, we made it public.	0
But then sometimes we had to go back and say we have new information that contradicts it.	0
So I testified for 11 hours.	0
[ applause ]	0
Anybody who watched that and listened to it knows that I answered every question that I was asked and when it was over the Republicans had to admit they didn't learn anything.	0
Why?	0
Because there had already been one independent investigation.	0
There had been seven or eight congressional investigations, mostly led by Republicans who all reached the same conclusions, that there were lessons to be learned.	0
And this is not the first time we lost Americans in a terrorist attack.	0
We lost 3,000 people on 9/11.	0
We lost Americans serving in embassies in Tanzania and Kenya when my husband was president.	0
We lost 250 Americans, both military and civilian, when Ronald Reagan was president in Beirut.	0
And at no other time were those tragedies were they politicized	0
[ applause ]	0
Instead people said, let's learn the lessons and save lives.	0
And that's when I did.	0
[ applause ]	0
But Secretary Clinton, what they're saying is that — what the families are saying is that you told your daughter Chelsea one thing and a different thing to them.	0
Jorge, that makes my point.	0
At the time I e-mailed with my daughter, a terrorist group had taken credit for the attacks on our facility in Benghazi.	0
Within 16, 18 hours, they rescinded taking credit.	0
They did it all on social media.	0
And the video did play a role.	0
We have captured one of the lead terrorists and he admits it was both a terrorist attack and it was influenced by the video.	0
This was fog of war.	0
This was complicated.	0
The most effective, comprehensive reports and studies demonstrate that.	0
Look, as I said in the beginning, I deeply regret that we lost four Americans.	0
Thank you senator.	0
And I of course sympathize with members of the families who are still, you know, very much grieving.	0
And I wish that there could be an easy answer at the time, but we learned a lot, and the intelligence kept...	0
Thank you.	0
... improving, and we learned enough to say what we think happened at Benghazi.	0
You have 30 seconds, Senator.	0
Well, I'm not going to comment on the Benghazi tragedy, but I will say this.	0
A series of articles in the New York Times talked about Secretary Clinton's role in urging the administration to go forward with regime change, getting rid of Gadhafi in Libya.	0
Gadhafi was a brutal dictator, there's no question.	0
But one of the differences between the secretary and I is I'm not quite so aggressive with regard to regime change.	0
I voted against the war in Iraq because I had a fear of what would happen the day after.	0
[ applause ]	0
And Secretary Clinton talks about Henry Kissinger...	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
... winning the praise of Henry Kissinger, I don't want Henry Kissinger's praise at all.	0
[ applause ]	0
We're going to — we're going to take a break.	0
We're taking a break.	0
We're taking a break.	0
[	0
through translator ] We'll continue with topics that are of interest to Spanish	0
[ inaudible ]	0
education, what to do with student debt.	0
Two topics that we will deal in a moment in the Democratic debate.	0
[ through translator ]	0
We remind you that you can download	0
[ inaudible ]	0
and we'll come back with the Democratic presidential debate.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
[ through translator]	0
And we continue now, connected with Univision for you to send us	0
[ inaudible ]	0
first Democratic debate focusing in Hispanic topics.	0
I have [ inaudible ] that supported	0
[ inaudible ]	0
Good evening, good evening.	0
We heard a lot about immigration, about the deportations and race.	0
In your opinion, who	0
[ inaudible ]	0
better and who presented the immigration proposal?	0
[ through translator ]	0
The two candidates did a good action of talking, explaining, but what concerned me a bit is that we — we haven't seen the plan of Senator Bernie Sanders, and we have not seen a plan in writing from Secretary Hillary Clinton.	0
So we want to see what she says.	0
That is important,	0
The six months — that we have seen as immigration is concerned, and we see that they're moving towards.	0
The community needs to not only immigration reform, but the raids have to stop.	0
Families that we have seen that are suffering, they have to be reunited.	0
[ through translator ]	0
We heard very emotional testimony of a mother that was brave enough to come here with her five children.	0
How did you feel when you heard her story?	0
And do you think that the candidates had empathy with the story?	0
[ through translator ]	0
I believe that this was the saddest moment that we had here at the debate, a mother with her children, separated from her husband.	0
And those children suffering because they do not have their father.	0
And this is what we see that is happening, that Republicans are doing not — by not approving a migratory reform, but also President Obama.	0
So we need — we need not only words, but plans as well.	0
And we need as a community to both stand up and support women as her.	0
[ through translator ]	0
Thank you, Gabby, and now the debate — the Democratic debate continues with Jorge Ramos and Maria Elena Salinas.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you,	0
[ inaudible ]	0
We'll continue with the debate now.	0
Senator Sanders, you call your opponent Hillary Clinton an establishment politician.	0
You yourself are a career politician.	0
Why should voters prefer a career politicians over an establishment politician?	0
Well, you've got to look at what the career is about.	0
And this is a career that has stood up to every special interest in this country.	0
I don't take money from Wall Street.	0
I demand that we break up the large financial institutions.	0
I don't take money from the pharmaceutical industry because I believe they are ripping off the American people and charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.	0
[ applause ]	0
I don't take money from the fossil fuel industry because they are destroying — they are destroying this planet through their emissions of carbon and creating the terrible climate change that we are seeing.	0
So I think it is true that I have served in Congress for many years.	0
But if you check my record, it is a record of strength for the environment, for workers, for seniors.	0
Unlike the secretary, I believe we should expand Social Security benefits.	0
It is a record of achievement for veterans, working with Republicans, helping to craft the most significant veterans healthcare bill passed in many decades.	0
So I think the point is look at the record, and it's a record that I am proud of.	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary,	0
[ inaudible ]	0
Latinos, according to the Univision-Washington Post poll, the number one issue is jobs and the economy.	0
Latino unemployment rate is higher than the national average.	0
Their net worth has gone down 42 percent during the Obama years, and 60 percent of Latinos make less than $15 an hour.	0
So, last week you tweeted that for the GOP, the economy is an after thought.	0
Well, many Latinos feel that they are an after thought.	0
Do you understand what the specific needs of Latinos are to improve their living conditions?	0
Well, I certainly know what all Americans need, and that is more jobs, with rising incomes.	0
It's something that I have worked on for many years.	0
It's why I've laid down the only really comprehensive plan about how to create more good jobs.	0
And there are several things that need to be addressed.	0
We do have to do more infrastructure spending.	0
That will put many Americans to work.	0
It's a good job that gets you on the ladder to the middle class.	0
We need to improve the conditions for manufacturing in our country and punish those companies that want to export jobs.	0
We need them to be incentivized to create jobs right here in America.	0
We also do have to combat climate change, and no state has more at stake in that than Florida.	0
And the best way to do that is not only enforcing the laws we have, but also the clean power plan that President Obama has put forth that I support, and the Paris agreement that I think was a huge step forward in the world, that Senator Sanders said was too weak, but I helped to lay the groundwork for that.	0
But we need more clean energy jobs and we have to do more to help small businesses.	0
You know, the fastest-growing segment of small businesses are minority and women-owned small business, and we need to help businesses get started.	0
The very distinguished congresswoman from New York who's been on the Small Business Committee, Congresswoman Velasquez, knows exactly what we need to be doing to create more small businesses.	0
We do need to raise the minimum wage and we have to guarantee equal pay for women.	0
Secretary, what would you do...	0
That will help Latinos as well as every other working person in our country.	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary, you talked in general terms, but you haven't really said what you would specifically do to improve the living conditions of Latinos.	0
Everything I just said will improve the living conditions, and I've spent a lot of time and effort talking to and mostly listening to Latinos.	0
Jobs are the number one issue, with rising incomes.	0
Close behind is education.	0
Every child deserves a good teacher in a good school, regardless of the zip code that they live in.	0
Following behind that is health care and how important it is to continue to build on the Affordable Care Act and provide access to health care.	0
And then there are a number of other issues — comprehensive immigration reform certainly at the top.	0
Your time is up, Secretary — sorry, your time is up.	0
OK, let me answer that question because it's a huge question.	0
And one of the — huge, I know.	0
[ laughter ]	0
One of the points that I've been making, and media does not seem to pick up on it, is that we have a real crisis not only with real unemployment in America being close to 10 percent, but youth unemployment in this country.	0
If you look at Latino kids between 17 and 20 who graduated high school, 36 percent of them are unemployed or underemployed...	1
Your time is up.	0
Oh wait a minute.	0
Can I have...	0
Go ahead.	0
... a little bit of time here please?	0
African-American kids are unemployed or underemployed to the tune of 51 percent.	1
That's why I co-sponsored legislation to put $5 billion into a jobs program to put our kids to work because I would rather invest in education and jobs than jails and incarceration.	0
[ applause ]	0
We have got to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.	0
The United States has got to join the rest of the industrialized world in guaranteeing health care to all people as a right.	0
[ applause ]	0
We need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.	0
And when we do that, under my plan, we create 13 million decent-paying jobs.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
[ applause ]	0
We have a question on education.	0
Senator, I'll continue with you.	0
You propose free college tuition.	0
No, I do not propose free college tuition, I proposed free tuition at public colleges and universities.	0
Yes I did.	0
[ applause ]	0
So under your plan, potentially, millions of students who can not truly afford college would be getting federal subsidies.	0
Is that right?	0
No.	0
What they would — look, this is what I believe, Jorge.	0
This is the year 2016.	0
Fifty years ago a high school degree got you a good job in the economy.	0
Today, in many respects, a college degree is the equivalent of a high school degree.	0
We have got to go beyond first grade to 12th grade when we talk about public education.	0
[ applause ]	0
So I do believe we should make public colleges and universities tuition-free, and I don't believe we should punish millions of young and not-so-young people with outrageous levels of student debt.	0
Because my question was if you think, for instance, if Donald Trump's grandchildren or — I'm sorry — Hillary Clinton's grandchildren, should they be able to go for free?	0
Absolutely.	0
For free.	0
Absolutely.	0
They can go — I don't think they will, but Donald Trump's kids — Donald Trump's kids can go to public school right now, I think Secretary Clinton is talking about making community colleges free, they can go to those things.	0
The point is we are going to get to Donald Trump by raising the taxes on the top 1 percent and our millionaires and billionaires.	0
But all of our people, in my view, regardless of income, should have a right to get a higher education.	0
I want children in the third grade to know that if they study hard, no matter what the income of their families, my family didn't have any income, my parents didn't go to college, they didn't have good income.	0
I want every kid to know if you do your school work, study hard, yes, you will be able to get a college education.	0
[ applause ]	0
We'll continue this — we'll continue talking about education.	0
For that, we go Enrique Cevedo has a question.	0
Enrique Cevido.	0
[ through translator ]	0
We just heard about free tuition from Senator Sanders, but right now there are millions of students who can't afford to pay their loans.	0
Maria Martinez is 20 years old and she's a major of political science at Miami-Dade College.	0
Secretary Clinton, she said she wants to go to grad school and get a PhD.	0
What are you going to do to help her achieve that goal and pay off her student debt?	0
Well, congratulations on your education.	0
And also on your plans for the future.	0
And here's what I will do.	0
We're going to refinance everyone's existing student debt, 40 million Americans have student debt.	0
[ applause ]	0
And right now, I go around asking people at my events if they know what their interest rate is and the interest rates literally go from like 8 percent to 14 percent.	0
It's outrageous that at a time when interest rates have been historically low, people borrowing money to invest in their education are paying some of the highest interest rates around.	0
And you can refinance your house to get a lower interest rate.	0
You can refinance your car.	0
Corporations can refinance their debt.	0
Under my plan, you will be able to also lower your debt, move into a program to pay it back as a percentage of your income and more than that, my plan for debt-free tuition at public colleges and universities will eventually eliminate any student debt.	0
But for people who have it, I'm going to put a date certain that after a certain number of years, you no longer have to pay anything.	0
The government has to quit making money off of lending money to young people to get their education.	0
[ applause ]	0
Karen, let's go back to you.	0
I think what Secretary Clinton just said is absolutely right.	0
I think I said it many months before she said it, but thanks for copying a very good idea.	0
[ applause ]	0
Now the question though, you know, I have been criticized a lot for thinking big.	0
You know, that's for believing that we can do great things as a nation.	0
One of the things we should not be doing obviously, is punishing people for doing what we want them to do and that is to get an education.	0
[ applause ]	0
But here is the point.	0
My program, making public colleges and universities tuition free, allowing people with debt to refinance at the lowest possible interest rates is a fairly expensive proposal, about $70 billion a year.	0
You know how I'm going to pay for it?	0
I'm going to pay for it by imposing a tax on Wall Street speculation.	0
[ applause ]	0
We bailed out — Secretary Clinton was one of those who voted to bail out Wall Street.	0
Now I think it's time for Wall Street to help the working families of this country.	0
Thank you senator.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Well, I'm going to respond to that, because I think it's a very important issue.	0
"And by the way, everybody, who, quote, ""got money"" in the quote, ""bailout"", that also included money for the auto rescue has paid it back."	0
So, the Treasury was out nothing.	0
Now that will no longer happen because we have Dodd-Frank and we will break up banks that pose a systemic threat to our economy.	0
[ applause ]	0
But let me say this.	0
Senator Sanders has talked about free college for everybody.	0
He's talked about universal, single payer health care for everybody.	0
And yet, when you ask questions, as many of us have and more importantly, independent experts, it's very hard to get answers.	0
And a lot of the answers say that this is going to be much more expensive than anything Senator Sanders is admitting to.	0
This is going to increase the federal government dramatically.	0
And, you know, my dad used to say, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.	0
All right.	0
Let me respond to this.	0
[ applause ]	0
And we deserve answers about how these programs will actually work and how they would be paid for.	0
I want you all to think.	0
What Secretary Clinton is saying is that the United States should continue to be the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all of our people.	0
[ applause ]	0
I think if the rest of the world can do it, we can.	0
And by the way, not only are we being ripped off by the drug companies, we are spending far, far more per capita on health care than any other major country on earth.	0
You may not think the American people are prepared to stand up to the insurance companies or the drug companies.	0
I think they are.	0
And I think we can pass...	0
Thank you senator.	0
[	0
crosstalk ]	0
[ applause ]	0
This is a very important point in this debate, because I do believe in universal coverage.	0
Remember, I fought for it 25 years ago.	0
I believe in it.	0
And I know that thanks the Affordable Care Act, we are now 90 percent of universal coverage.	0
I will build on the Affordable Care Act.	0
I will take it further.	0
I will reduce the cost.	0
But I just respectfully disagree.	0
Between the Republicans trying to repeal the first chance we've ever had to get to universal health care, and Senator Sanders wanting to throw us into a contentious debate over single-payer, I think the smart approach is build on and protect the Affordable Care Act.	0
Make it work.	0
Reduce the cost.	0
[ applause ]	0
I'm on the committee, I know a little bit about this, I'm on the committee, Health, Education, Labor Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act.	0
And it has done a number of good things.	0
But when Secretary Clinton says, well, 90 percent of the people have insurance, yes, not really.	0
Many of you may have insurance, but you have outrageously high deductibles and co-payments.	0
One out of five Americans cannot afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe.	0
Elderly people are cutting their pills in half.	0
I do believe that we should do what every other major country on earth does, and I think when the American people stand up and fight back, yes, we can have it, a Medicare for all health care system.	0
[ applause ]	0
I'm going to call time here because I want to move on to a subject that more than two dozen Florida mayors have asked to raise with you.	0
They have asked us to share with you their concern over the effects of rising sea levels and climate change in their communities.	0
[ applause ]	0
Just take a look at this map.	0
You can see that no state has more at stake than Florida does.	0
And no city has more at stake than Miami, the city in which we are sitting.	0
But many Republicans argue that this is not a man-made problem.	0
Senator Sanders, is it possible to move forward on this issue if you do not get a bipartisan consensus, and what would you do?	0
Well, first of all, Karen, when you have Republican candidates for president and in Congress telling you that climate change is a hoax, which is Donald Trump and other candidates' position, what they are really saying is, we don't have the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry.	0
[ applause ]	0
What candidates are saying is if we stand up to the fossil fuel industry, and transform our energy system away from coal and oil and gas to energy efficiency and wind and solar and geothermal and other sustainable technologies, you know what happens to that Republican who listens to the scientists?	0
On that day, that Republican loses his campaign funding from the Koch brothers and the fossil fuel industry.	0
So you've just described the problem, but how would you move forward given that this is the situation?	0
The way I would move forward in every other area.	0
And what we are doing in this campaign is fighting not only to become president, but I'm the only candidate who says no president, not Bernie Sanders, can do it all.	0
You know what we need, Karen?	0
We need a political revolution in this country.	0
[ applause ]	0
And when millions of people stand up and tell the fossil fuel industry that their profits, their short-term profits are less significant than the long-term health of this planet, we will win.	0
That is the way change always takes place.	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary Clinton, can we do this without a bipartisan consensus?	0
No major environmental legislation has ever passed without bipartisan votes.	0
Well, Karen, first of all, I was proud a number of mayors from Florida campaign for me in South Carolina.	0
I had a chance to talk to some of them about this issue.	0
It is a really serious one.	0
And there isn't much time left to do several things that I will move quickly to do.	0
You can see already what's happening in Miami, particularly in Miami Beach with tides rising.	0
So we do have to invest in resilience and mitigation while we are trying to cut emissions and make up for the fact that this is clearly man-made and man-aggravated.	0
And there are certain things that the president has done through executive action that I will absolutely support.	0
All the Republican say they will, if they're elected, heaven forbid, repeal all of those executive actions.	0
I will maintain them and act on them.	0
The clean power plan is something that Senator Sanders has said he would delay implementing, which makes absolutely no sense.	1
We need to implement all of the president's executive actions and quickly move to make a bridge from coal to natural gas to clean energy.	0
That is the way we will keep the lights on while we are transitioning to a clean energy future.	0
And when I talk about resilience, I think that is an area we can get Republican support on.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Let me be very clear...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Because — because after all — excuse me.	0
I have introduced...	0
Excuse me, excuse me.	0
Did you ask me to speak?	0
After all, there are...	0
[ applause ]	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Madam Secretary, when he asked me to speak...	0
You know, you don't — you know, you don't have to do much more than look at rising insurance rates.	0
Secretary, thank you very much.	0
You know, most of the property in Florida will be at risk in the next 50 years.	0
I think I can get a bipartisan consensus on resilience and then implementing the president's orders until we frankly win back enough seats, take back the Senate, and get back to bipartisan...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Senator Sanders?	0
[ applause ]	0
[ inaudible ]	0
have as much time as she just had.	0
Absolutely.	0
This is your debate.	0
Thank you.	0
Let's be clear.	0
You're looking at the senator who introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation in the history of the United States Senate.	0
[ applause ]	0
Now, I hope that Secretary Clinton would join me if we are serious about climate change, about imposing a tax on carbon on the fossil fuel industry and making massive investments in energy efficiency and sustainable energy.	0
And by the way, while we are on the subject of energy, I hope you'll join me in ending fracking in the United States of America.	0
[ applause ]	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Secretary Clinton, Senator Elizabeth Warren — Senator Elizabeth Warren says personnel is policy.	0
And she says that there is a revolving door between Wall Street and the highest levels of economic policy-making and regulation in Washington.	0
Three of the last four Treasury secretaries appointed by Democratic presidents had ties to Citigroup.	0
Do you agree with Elizabeth Warren's criticism that both your husband's administration and President Obama's have relied too heavily on advisers who represent the world view of the big banks?	0
Well, Karen, I do agree that we have to end the revolving door.	0
I strongly support a piece of legislation from Senator Tammy Baldwin that would do just that.	0
And I will be looking for people who will put the interests of consumers first, who will do more to try to make sure Main Street flourishes.	0
And I will very much reach out and ask for advice as to who should be appointed, including to Senator Warren and many of my other former colleagues in the Senate.	0
But I think it's important also to look at what we want to accomplish.	0
You know, in the debates we've had — maybe this is the seventh or so — Senator Sanders is always criticizing the two recent Democratic presidents — President Clinton and President Obama.	0
And that's fine, but I wish he would criticize and join me in criticizing George W. Bush, who I think wrecked the economy and created the conditions for the great recession.	0
You know, at the end of the '90s, we had 23 million new jobs.	0
Incomes went up for everybody.	0
We were talking earlier about what needs to be done for Latinos and African Americans.	0
Well, we were doing it by the end of the '90s.	0
Median family income went up 17 percent.	0
For minorities, it went up even more.	0
Along came the Republicans, trickle-down economics — one of the worst ideas since snake oil — was put back into place.	0
And we ended up with the great recession.	0
President Obama had to rescue the economy.	0
And I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for doing that.	0
Senator Sanders, your name was mentioned.	0
[ applause ]	0
Now, let me say this.	0
I gather Secretary Clinton hasn't listened to too many of my speeches.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Or followed my work in the Congress as very few people stood up to George W. Bush whether it was the war in Iraq or any other of his policies.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Now, when we talk about the policies of the 1990s, I worked closely and supported President Clinton.	0
And obviously, I have worked very closely in supporting President Obama, who has taken our economy a very long way from where Bush left us.	0
But when you go back to the 1990s, let's remember, that's when Wall Street deregulation took place.	0
Thank you senator.	0
[ applause ]	0
That's when disastrous trade policies took place.	0
We're going to break now.	0
Yes, good things happened, but some dangerous mistakes were made that laid the groundwork for some of the problems we're having with a disappearing middle class today.	0
Thank you senator.	0
Time is up.	0
Thank you.	0
We're going to take a break.	0
And when we come back, we'll talk about Latin America.	0
[ Speaking in Spanish ]	0
When we come back, we'll talk about Latin America.	0
Don't leave.	0
Of course you can follow us on Facebook live.	0
Don't forget.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
[ through translator ]	0
We continue with the Democratic debate.	0
Let's talk about Latin America.	0
Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders, it will be my welcome to Miami question.	0
So it goes as follows.	0
President Barack Obama is going to Cuba in two weeks.	0
Forty percent of Cuban Americans supporting to uphold — oppose a new White House policy towards Cuba.	0
If you were president, would you meet with the dissidents in Cuba?	0
Would you meet with Fidel Castro?	0
And would you consider Raul Castro a president or a dictator?	0
Welcome to Miami.	0
Well, first of all, I supported the president's moves.	0
I helped to implement some of them leading up to the announcements when I was secretary of state, expanding travel opportunities, remittances.	0
And I certainly told the president toward the end of my time that I hoped he would be able to move toward diplomatic relations and to make more of an impact by building up the relationship.	0
And there are no better ambassadors for freedom, democracy and economic opportunity than Cuban Americans.	0
So the more that we can have that kind of movement back and forth, the more likely we are to be able to move Cuba toward greater freedom, greater respect for rights.	0
You know, I'm looking forward to following the president's trip.	0
I do think meeting with dissidents, meeting with people who have been voices, tribunes of freedom and opportunity is important.	0
The Cuban people deserve to have their human rights respected and upheld, they deserve to be able to move towards democracy where they pick their own leads.	0
And I think both Castros have to be considered authoritarian and dictatorial because they are not freely chosen by the people that are in Cuba.	0
[ applause ]	0
I hope someday there will be leaders who are chosen by the Cuban people, and I hope that democracy will be deeply rooted in Cuban soil and that the people of Cuba will have every opportunity to fulfill their own dreams in their own country.	0
That is my hope.	0
Senator Sanders...	0
On Facebook, by the way, this is the conversation that everybody is having, talking about Cuba.	0
Senator Sanders.	0
Look, I understand that not everybody in Florida or in the United States will agree with me, but I think we have got to end the embargo.	0
[ applause ]	0
I believe that we should move towards full and normalized political relations with Cuba.	0
I think at the end of the day, it will be a good thing for the Cuban people.	0
It will enable them, I think when they see people coming into their country from the United States, move in a more democratic direction, which is what I want to see.	0
So right — I'm sorry.	0
Let's continue with another question, Senator, if you don't mind.	0
Sure.	0
In 1985, you praised the Sandinista government and you said that Daniel Ortega was an impressive guy.	0
This is what you said about Fidel Castro.	0
Let's listen.	0
[ begin video clip ]	0
You may recall way back in, when was it, 1961, they invaded Cuba, and everybody was totally convinced that Castro was the worst guy in the world.	0
All the Cuban people were going to rise up in rebellion against Fidel Castro.	0
They forgot that he educated their kids, gave them health care, totally transformed their society.	0
[ end video clip ]	0
In South Florida there are still open wounds among some exiles regarding socialism and communism.	0
So please explain what is the difference between the socialism that you profess and the socialism in Nicaragua, Cuba and Venezuela.	0
Well, let me just answer that.	0
What that was about was saying that the United States was wrong to try to invade Cuba, that the United States was wrong trying to support people to overthrow the Nicaraguan government, that the United States was wrong trying to overthrow in 1954, the government — democratically elected government of Guatemala.	0
Throughout the history of our relationship with Latin America we've operated under the so-called Monroe Doctrine, and that said the United States had the right do anything that they wanted to do in Latin America.	0
So I actually went to Nicaragua and I very shortly opposed the Reagan administration's efforts to overthrow that government.	0
And I strongly opposed earlier Henry Kissinger and the — to overthrow the government of Salvador Aliende in Chile.	0
I think the United States should be working with governments around the world, not get involved in regime change.	0
And all of these actions, by the way, in Latin America, brought forth a lot of very strong anti-American sentiments.	0
That's what that was about.	0
Senator, in retrospect, have you ever regretted the characterizations that you made of Daniel Ortega and Fidel Castro that way?	0
I'm sorry.	0
Please say that...	0
In retrospect, have you ever regretted the characterizations of Daniel Ortega and Fidel Castro that you made in 1985?	0
The key issue here was whether the United States should go around overthrowing small Latin American countries.	0
I think that that was a mistake...	0
You didn't answer the question.	0
...both in Nicaragua and Cuba.	0
Look, let's look at the facts here.	0
Cuba is, of course, an authoritarian undemocratic country, and I hope very much as soon as possible it becomes a democratic country.	0
But on the other hand...	0
[ applause ]	0
...on the other hands, it would be wrong not to state that in Cuba they have made some good advances in health care.	0
They are sending doctors all over the world.	0
They have made some progress in education.	0
I think by restoring full diplomatic relations with Cuba, it will result in significant improvements to the lives of Cubans and it will help the United States and our business community invest.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Your time is up on that.	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary, I have a question on Puerto Rico.	0
Puerto Rico is bankrupt.	0
It owes more than $70 billion it cannot pay and we have a question from Facebook.	0
Lian Purvea is asking you the following; I would like to know if during the first 100 days of your presidency, you will help Puerto Rico restructure its public debt and help its economy.	0
The first 100 days, secretary.	0
Absolutely, although it happens before I am president if I am so fortunate to be.	0
I have been calling for months that the Congress must give authority to Puerto Rico to restructure its debts.	0
[ applause ]	0
Just like it has enabled states and cities to restructure their debt.	0
And it's a grave injustice for the Congress, led by the Republicans to be refusing to enact that opportunity within the bankruptcy law.	0
And what we see in Puerto Rico now is a lot of suffering.	0
We see schools being closed, we see health care being denied and we see a thousand Puerto Rican families a month moving to the United States, mostly to Florida.	0
Puerto Ricans are citizen of America.	0
[ applause ]	0
They deserve to be treated as citizens and to be given the opportunity to get back on their feet economically.	0
And I just want to add one thing to the question you were asking Senator Sanders.	0
I think in that same interview, he praised what he called the revolution of values in Cuba and talked about how people were working for the common good, not for themselves.	0
I just couldn't disagree more.	0
You know, if the values are that you oppress people, you disappear people, you imprison people or even kill people for expressing their opinions, for expressing freedom of speech, that is not the kind of revolution of values that I ever want to see anywhere.	0
[ applause ]	0
Well, as I said earlier, I don't believe it is the business of the United States government to be overthrowing small countries around the world.	0
And number two, when you get to Puerto Rico, there's an issue that we have not talked about.	0
That little island is $73 billion in debt and the government now is paying interest rates of up to 11 percent.	0
And many of the bonds that they are paying off were purchased by vulture capitalists for 30 cents on the dollar.	0
And what I have said in talking to the leaders of Puerto Rico, we've got to bring people together.	0
And it's not the people of Puerto Rico, or the children or the schools.	0
Senator, OK	0
But maybe some of these vulture capitalists who are going to have to lose a little bit of money in this process.	0
We need to move on to another topic.	0
Secretary Clinton, there is a vacancy on the supreme court at a very crucial moment.	0
Among other things, the court is considering the most significant abortion restrictions in a generation.	0
So I would like to share with you a question that we got from Facebook from Joshua Dansby, a law student in Washington, D.C. who wants to know what specific forms of qualifications you would look for in a Supreme Court justice?	0
Well, I think this is one of the most important issues facing our country right now.	0
And I fully support President Obama's intention under the constitution to nominate a successor to Justice Scalia.	0
And I believe...	0
[ applause ]	0
...I believe no state probably understands this better than Florida.	0
Because let's remember three words: Bush versus Gore.	0
[ applause ]	0
A court took away a presidency.	0
Now we've got the Republican Congress trying to take away the constitution.	0
And we should not tolerate that.	0
[ applause ]	0
And so from my perspective, it is imperative that we put enormous pressure on the Republicans in the Senate to do their constitutional duty.	0
Now, obviously you look for people who are not only qualified on paper, but have a heart, have life experience, understand what these decisions mean in the lives of Americans.	0
And understand the balance of power that their decisions can disrupt one way or the other.	0
So clearly, I would look for people who believe that Roe v. Wade is settled law and that Citizens United needs to be overturned as quickly as possible.	0
[ applause ]	0
It's time to go to commercial.	0
We're going to commercial.	0

We come back with the Democratic debate, sponsored by Univision, Washington Post and Facebook.	0
We are reaching the end, asking the candidates to give their last words.	0
We're coming to the end of this wonderful debate, and it's time for your closing remarks.	0
Secretary Clinton, you're first.	0
Well, thank you very much for a lively debate.	0
And I appreciate greatly all the questions, especially the questions in person from the people here and those coming at us from Facebook.	0
It just reinforces my strong commitment to do everything I can to break down all the barriers that stand in the way of people living up to their own potential, and of our country doing the same.	0
So I am going to take on those economic barriers.	0
I have a plan to create jobs and raise incomes.	0
I'm going to take on the education barriers that often leave too many children behind even after they have completed schooling.	0
I'm going to take on the healthcare barriers.	0
I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that we unite our country.	0
I will find common ground, just as I have as first lady, as senator and secretary of state.	0
I will also stand my ground wherever matters of principles are at stake.	0
I would be honored to have your support in the upcoming primary on Tuesday, and hope to have the great honor of serving you as your president.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Sanders, your closing remarks.	0
This has been a wonderful debate, but time being limited, some of the most important issues facing our country have not been asked.	0
And that is, is it acceptable that in America the top 0.1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.	0
Is it acceptable that while the average American works longer hours for lower wages, 58 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent.	0
Is it acceptable that Wall Street and billionaires are spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to buy elections?	0
Is that democracy or this that oligarchy?	0
Which is why I believe we've got to overturn Citizens United and move to public funding of elections.	0
Is it right that in the greatest, wealthiest country in the history of the world, so many of our young people can't even afford to go to college or leave school deeply in debt, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world?	0
If we stand up, fight back, we can do a lot better.	0
That's why I'm running for president.	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary and Senator, we want to thank both of you for being here, for joining us tonight.	0
And, of course, we also want to thank also the wonderful crowd that was here today.	0
Our audience has been wonderful, and thank you for being here.	0
[ applause ]	0
And on behalf of The Washington Post and Univision and Facebook, we'd like to thank you again for joining us in this debate and also to remind people to get out and vote.	0

We want to use these last moments, it's very important to go out and vote, remember next Tuesday, March 15th is elections in Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, all these states — in all these states the Hispanic vote is crucial	0
[ inaudible ]	0
Talk about the importance of Hispanic votes, how in very close races it is the Hispanic vote that can choose the next president of the United States.	0
This is Hispanic power, but the only way that this can happen is if we all go out and vote.	0
So you know it perfectly, who does not vote doesn't count.	0

And as you know, nobody can reach the White House without the Hispanic vote.	0
Remember, don't let others decide for you.	0
The power is in your hands, you have to participate, you have to vote.	0

Welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate.	0
Candidates, we're about to begin opening statements.	0
But first, a quick review of the ground rules that your campaigns agreed to earlier this month to try to ensure a fair debate.	0
As moderators, we will attempt to guide the discussion.	0
You will each receive one minute to answer questions, 30 seconds for responses and rebuttals, and 15 additional seconds if a moderator asks for a clarification.	0
The timing lights will remind you of these limits.	0
Please respect them, and please refrain from interrupting other candidates during their allotted time.	0
A candidate infringing on another candidate's time will have his or her time reduced.	0
We, again, remind our audience inside the Fox Theatre to try to remain silent when candidates are actively debating.	0
The candidates need to be able to properly hear the questions and each other.	0
Let's start with opening statements.	0
You will each receive one minute.	0
Mayor Bill de Blasio, please begin.	0
To the working people of America, tonight I bring you a message of hope.	0
We can make change in this country.	0
I know from personal experience it can be done.	0
When I became the mayor of the nation's largest city, I set us on a path of bold change.	0
They said it couldn't be done, but we gave pre-K to every child for free.	0
We got rid of stop-and-frisk and we lowered crime.	0
We raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour.	0
Yes, it can be done.	0
Now, tonight we have to get to the heart and soul of who we are as Democrats.	0
There are good people on this stage, but there are real differences.	0
Joe Biden told wealthy donors that nothing fundamentally would change if he were president.	0
Kamala Harris said she's not trying to restructure society.	0
Well, I am.	0
For 40 years, working people have taken it on the chin in this country.	0
For 40 years, the rich have gotten richer and they've paid less and less in taxes.	0
It cannot go on this way.	0
When I'm president, we will even up the score and we will tax the hell out of the wealthy to make this a fairer country and to make sure it's a country that puts working people first.	0
(OFF-MIKE)	0
Thank you, Mayor de Blasio.	0
Senator Michael Bennet?	0
Thank you.	0
"Last week, I saw one of those Trump signs that says, ""America, love it or leave it."""	0
And it was on the outside of a church.	0
I love America.	0
And I know we can make it better.	0
Before coming to the Senate I ran (inaudible) school district where most of the kids live in poverty.	0
Those kids have exactly the same hopes that I had.	0
Their parents have exactly the same hopes for them that my parents had for me, and that Susan and I have for our three children.	0
But for the last three years, we've been consumed by a president who frankly doesn't give a damn about your kids or mine.	0
Mr. President; kids belong in classrooms, not cages.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And they deserve something better than a bully in the White House.	0
Let's end this three ringed circus in Washington and make -- and let's make this election about reclaiming our future for our kids and our democracy.	0
Empty promises won't beat Donald Trump, I can.	0
Governor Jay Inslee.	0
Good evening.	0
I'm Jay Inslee.	0
I am running for president because the people in this room and the democrats watching tonight are the last best hope for humanity on this planet.	0
If -- if we make defeating the climate crisis the top priority of the United States, we will have a fighting chance to save ourselves and our children's future.	0
It has to be our top priority.	0
My plan is one of national mobilization, quickly bringing 100 percent clean energy to Americans, creating 8 million good union jobs.	0
This is a big, bold, ambitious plan for clean energy for a big bold ambitious nation.	0
Middle ground approaches are not enough.	0
We must confront the fossil fuel industry.	0
I've been working on this for 25 years.	0
And now we know this, we are at tipping point and whether we shrink from this challenge or rise to it is the vital question of our time.	0
We democrats believe we can still do big things in this nation.	0
We can defeat the climate crisis.	0
Let's get to work.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.	0
My grandmother taught me that nothing's impossible.	0
She spent two generations organizing women in upstate New York.	0
My mother taught me nothing's impossible.	0
She was one of only three women in her law school class and worked with gay couples for basic rights.	0
If you want to get something done, just tell me it's impossible.	0
As a freshman senator I was told you couldn't repeal Don't Ask, Don't Tell.	0
Even members of my own party told me it wasn't convenient.	0
When are civil rights ever convenient?	0
We stood up to the Pentagon and we got it done.	0
Not impossible.	0
10 years ago I was told you couldn't pass healthcare for our 9/11 first responders, those heroes who raced up the towers when others were coming down.	0
Even when Congress turned its back on them, we kept fighting.	0
Just last week we made the 9/11 health bill permanent.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Beating Donald Trump definitely not impossible.	0
We need a nominee who will take on the big fights and win.	0
We need a nominee who doesn't know the meaning of impossible.	0
Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I love our country.	0
It's why I enlisted after 9/11, why I've served as a soldier for over 16 years, deployed twice to the Middle East, and serve in Congress now for almost seven years.	0
I know what patriotism is and I've known many great patriots throughout my life.	0
And let me tell you this, Donald Trump is not behaving like a patriot.	0
As president I will bring this spirit of real patriotism to the White House, serving the interest of all Americans, not just the rich and powerful.	0
I'll fight for our rights and freedoms of all Americans, upholding these principles in our constitution upon which our country was founded, fighting for justice and equality for all.	0
Fighting for every single American regardless of race or religion as we strive towards that more perfect union.	0
And as president I'll bring this unifying spirit of love for country and the soldier's values of service above self to the White House, truly leading a government of by and for the people.	0
Secretary Julian Castro.	0
Thank you, Dana, and good evening.	0
You know, just a few days ago we were reminded and inspired by our fellow Americans in Puerto that public service is not fundamentally about any of us; it's about you and your family.	0
I want you to know that, if I'm elected president, that I will work hard every single day so that you and your family can have good health care when you need it, so that your children and grandchildren can get a good education so that they can reach their dreams and that you can have good job opportunities, whether you live here in a big city like Detroit or in a small town in our country.	0
I know we have a wonderful, special nation but that too many people are struggling.	0
And I know what that's like, too.	0
You know, I grew up with a single mom in a poor neighborhood.	0
But like many of you, I don't want to make America anything again.	0
I don't want us to go backward.	0
We're not going back to the past.	0
We're not going back where we came from.	0
We're going to move forward.	0
We're going to make America better than it's ever been in the years to come.	0
Let's do that together.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Andrew Yang?	0
If you've heard anything about me and my campaign, you've heard that someone is running for president who wants to give every American $1,000 a month.	0
I know this may sound like a gimmick, but this is a deeply American idea, from Thomas Paine to Martin Luther King to today.	0
Let me tell you why we need to do it and how we pay for it.	0
Why do we need to do it?	0
We already automated away millions of manufacturing jobs, and chances are your job can be next.	0
If you don't believe me, just ask an auto worker here in Detroit.	0
How do we pay for it?	0
Raise your hand in the crowd if you've seen stores closing where you live.	0
It is not just you.	0
Amazon is closing 30 percent of America's stores and malls and paying zero in taxes while doing it.	0
We need to do the opposite of much of what we're doing right now, and the opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
So let me share the math.	0
A thousand dollars a month for every adult would be $461 million every month, right here in Detroit alone.	0
The automation of our jobs is the central challenge facing us today.	0
It is why Donald Trump is our president, and any politician not addressing it is failing the American people.	0

Please, continue, Senator.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Donald Trump, from Charleston to Baltimore to even the border, is using the tired, old language of demagogues, of fear-mongers, of racists, to try to divide our country against itself.	0
We know who Donald Trump is, but in this election, the question is who are we as a people?	0
We have serious problems in America.	0
We have deep wounds and seriously deeply rooted challenges.	0
We desperately need to heal as a nation and move forward.	0
Because we know in this country that our fates are united, that we have a common destiny.	0
The call of this election is the call to unite in common cause and common purpose.	0
That's how we will beat Donald Trump.	0
That's how I will beat Donald Trump.	0
And as your president, that's how I will govern and move us forward together.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Kamala Harris?	0
This is an inflection moment in the history of our country.	0
I think we all know that.	0
"This is a moment in time that is requiring us each as individuals and collectively to look in a mirror and ask a question, that question being ""Who are we?"""	0
And I think most of us know that part of the answer to that question is we are better than this.	0
So this then becomes a moment that we must fight for the best of who we are.	0
And fight, of course, we will.	0
And this is not a new fight for us as Americans.	0
We have always been prepared to fight for our ideals.	0
We have always been a nation that fights for the best of who we are.	0
And I'll tell you, I come from fighters.	0
My parents met when they were active in the civil rights movement.	0
My sister, Maya, and I joke we grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults who spent full time marching and shouting about this thing called justice.	0
And I am prepared to march with you, to fight with you for the best of who we are and to successfully prosecute the case of four more years of Donald Trump, and against him.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Vice President Joe Biden.	0
Tonight, I think Democrats are expecting some engagement here.	0
And I expect we'll get it.	0
I'm running for president to restore the soul of this country.	0
You know, we have a president, as everybody has acknowledged here, every day is ripping at the social fabric of this country, but no one man has the capacity to rip that apart.	0
It's too strong.	0
We're too good.	0
Just look at this stage, made up of very diverse people from diverse backgrounds, went on to be mayors, senators, governors, congresswomen, members of the cabinet, and, yes, even a vice president.	0
Mr. President, this is America.	0
And we are stronger and great because of this diversity, Mr. President, not in spite of it, Mr. President.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We love it.	0
We are not leaving it.	0
We are here to stay.	0
And we're certainly not going to leave it to you.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Vice President Biden.	0
I want to start the debate with one of the top priorities for Democratic voters, and that is health care.	0
Senator Harris, this week you released a new health care plan which would preserve private insurance and take 10 years to phase in.	0
"Vice President Biden's campaign calls your plan, quote, ""a have-it-every-which-way approach"" and says it's just part of a confusing pattern of equivocating about your health care stance."	0
What do you say to that?	0
Well, they're probably confused because they've not read it.	0
But the reality is that I have been spending time in this campaign listening to American families, listening to experts, listening to health care providers, and what I came away with is a very clear understanding that I needed to create a plan that was responsive to the needs of the American people, responsive to their needs understanding that insurance companies have been jacking up the prices for far too long, that American families have to be held down by deductibles and co-pays and premiums that can cause them bankruptcy.	0
I listened to the American families who said four years is just not enough to transition into this new plan, so I devised a plan where it's going to be 10 years of a transition.	0
I listened to American families who said I want an option that will be under your Medicare system that allows a private plan.	0
So I designed a plan where, yes, responsive to the needs of American families, there will be a public plan, under my plan for Medicare, and a private plan, under my plan for Medicare.	0
We must agree that access to health care must be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it.	0
And in America today, far too many people -- in fact, 30 million people -- are going without access to health care.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Thank you, Senator Harris.	0
Vice President Biden, your response.	0
Well, my response is that the senator has had several plans so far.	0
And any time someone tells you you're going to get something good in 10 years, you should wonder why it takes 10 years.	0
If you noticed, there is no talk about the fact that the plan in 10 years will cost $3 trillion.	0
You will lose your employer-based insurance.	0
And in fact, you know, this is the single most important issue facing the public.	0
And to be very blunt and to be very straightforward, you can't beat President Trump with double-talk on this plan.	0
Your response, Senator Harris?	0
Absolutely.	0
Unfortunately, Vice President Biden, you're just simply inaccurate in what you're describing.	0
The reality is that our plan will bring health care to all Americans under a Medicare for All system.	0
Our plan will allow people to start signing up on the first day.	0
Babies will be born into our plan, and right now, 4 million babies almost are born every day in America -- or every year in America.	0
Under our plan, we will ensure that everyone has access to health care.	0
Your plan, by contrast, leaves out almost 10 million Americans.	0
So I think that you should really think about what you're saying, but be reflective and understand that the people of America want access to health care and do not want cost to be their barrier to getting it.	0
Senator Harris, thank you.	0
Vice President Biden, your response?	0
The plan, no matter how you cut it, costs $3 trillion when it is, in fact, employed, number one.	0
Ten years from now, after two terms of the senator being president, after her time.	0
Secondly, it will require middle-class taxes to go up, not down.	0
Thirdly, it will eliminate employer-based insurance.	0
And fourthly, what happens in the meantime?	0
I'd like to respond.	0
First of all, the cost of doing nothing is far too expensive.	0
Second, we are now paying $3 trillion a year for health care in America.	0
Over the next 10 years, it's probably going to be $6 trillion.	0
We must act.	0
My plan is about immediately allowing people to sign up and get into coverage.	0
Right now in America, we have seniors, who every day -- millions of seniors are going into the Medicare system and they are getting full coverage and the kind of coverage they need.	0
All people should have access to health care.	0
And costs should not be their barrier.	0
Thank you, Senator Harris.	0
Mayor de Blasio, let's bring you in here.	0
What's your response?	0
Thank you.	0
I don't know what the vice president and the senator are talking about.	0
The folks I talk to about health insurance say that their health insurance isn't working for them.	0
There's tens of millions of Americans who don't even have health insurance, tens of millions more who have health insurance they can barely make work because of the co-pays, the deductibles, the premiums, the out-of-pocket expenses.	0
There's this mythology that somehow all of these folks are in love with their insurance in America.	0
What I hear from union members and from hard-working, middle-class people is they wish they had better insurance and they're angry at private insurance companies that skim all the profits off the top and make it impossible for everyday people to get coverage like mental care...	0
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.	0
... dental care, the things that would be full coverage for all Americans.	0
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.	0
Vice President Biden, you just heard Mayor de Blasio.	0
He said in the past that Democrats who wanted to keep the private insurance industry are defending a health care system that is not working.	0
What's your response?	0
My response is, Obamacare is working.	0
The way to build this and get to it immediately is to build on Obamacare.	0
Go back and do -- take back all the things that Trump took away, provide a public option, meaning every single person in America would be able to buy into that option if they didn't like their employer plan, or if they're on Medicaid, they'd automatically be in the plan.	0
It would take place immediately.	0
It would move quickly.	0
And it would insure the vast, vast, vast majority of Americans.	0
In the meantime, what happens?	0
Did anybody tell you how much their plans cost?	0
My plan costs $750 billion.	0
That's what it costs.	0
Not $30 trillion.	0
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.	0
Senator Gillibrand, you support Medicare for All.	0
How do you feel about Senator Harris continuing to call her health proposal Medicare for All, when it includes a far more significant role for private insurance than the bill you co-sponsored?	0
I think for the viewers in the audience right now, they're at risk of losing the forest through the trees, because the truth is, health care in America should be a right.	0
When I was a young mother and had Theo as an infant, he had an allergic reaction to eggs and his whole body turned red and puffy.	0
I had to rush him to the emergency room.	0
My heart is palpitating because I'm worried that his throat will close.	0
I am not worried about not having an insurance card or a credit card in my wallet.	0
I know whatever they're going to prescribe, whether it's an EpiPen or an inhaler, I can afford it.	0
The truth about health care in America today is people can't afford it.	0
They cannot afford -- and the insurance companies for these plans that rely on insurance companies, I'm sorry, they're for-profit companies.	0
They have an obligation to their shareholders.	0
They pay their CEO millions of dollars.	0
They have to have quarterly profits.	0
They have fat in the system that's real and it should be going to health care.	0
So let's not lose the forest for the trees.	0
And last, let's not forget what the Republicans are doing, because the truth is, the Republicans and Trump, their whole goal is to take away your health care.	0
Thank you.	0
To make it harder for you to afford it, even if you have pre-existing conditions.	0
Thank you, Senator Gillibrand.	0
Senator Harris, your response?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
In response to Senator Biden about the Affordable Care Act, it is important that you understand that our Medicare for All plan has actually by the architect of the Obama Affordable Care Act been described as one of the most effective ways to bring health care to all.	0
Kathleen Sebelius has endorsed our plan as being something that will get us to where we need to go.	0
In terms of the point that Senator Gillibrand is raising, I couldn't agree more.	0
Senator Biden, your plan will keep and allow insurance companies to remain with status quo, doing business as usual, and that's going to be about jacking up co-pays, jacking up deductibles...	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
It will still be the situation that people going to an emergency room...	0
Thank you, Senator Harris.	0
Vice President Biden, your response?	0
... have to come out $5,000.	0
My plan makes a limit of co-pay to be $1,000, because we further support the -- the ability to buy into the Obamacare plan.	0
Secondly, the idea that this is somehow a bad idea, no one has to keep their private insurance, but they - if they like their insurance, they should be able to keep it.	0
Nothing is demanded in my plan that there be private insurance.	0
It says, if the 160 million who have it say they like their employer insurance, they should have a right to have it.	0
If they don't, they can buy into the Biden plan, which is Obamacare with -	0
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.	0
Thank you.	0
Senator Booker, let me bring you in here.	0
You say you support Medicare for All.	0
You also say you are not going to pull private health insurance from more than 150 million Americans in exchange for a government plan, but that's what Medicare for All would do.	0
So how do you square that?	0
Well, first of all, let me just say, that the person that's enjoying this debate most right now is Donald Trump, as we pit Democrats against each other, while he is working right now to take away Americans' healthcare.	0
There is a court case working through the system that's going to gut the Affordable Care Act and actually gut protections on preexisting conditions.	0
And so, I was raised by two civil rights parents who told me, always keep your eyes on the prize.	0
And that is that in the United States of America, every Democrat should stand with the belief that everyone should have access to healthcare, that it's a human right.	0
And how we get there, it has to be to end this broken system, because we are on our way, just a handful of years of literally spending 20 percent of our economy, one out of every $5 spent on healthcare.	0
And we spend more than every other nation, on everything from MRIs to insulin drugs, multiple mores than other countries - multiple more than other countries.	0
And so, do you want to know what I'm going to do?	0
I'm going to work to get us to a point where Medicare for All - where everyone is covered.	0
But this pitting against progressives against moderates, saying one is unrealistic and the other doesn't care enough, that to me is dividing our party and demoralizing us in face of the real enemy here.	0
And I'm -	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
- going to keep fighting for that.	0
Congressman Gabbard, what's your response?	0
The reality is right now, we don't have a healthcare system.	0
We have a sick care system, and there are far too many people in this country who are sick and unable to get the care that they need because they cannot afford it.	0
So the core of this problem is the fact that big insurance companies and big pharmaceutical companies who've been profiting off the backs of sick people have had a seat at the table, writing this legislation.	0
Now, Kamala Harris just talked about Kathleen Sebelius who helped write her bill.	0
This just pointed to the fatal flaw in her proposal.	0
Sebelius works for Medicare Advantage, a private insurance company who will stand to profit under her plan.	0
If we're seeking to really reform our healthcare system, we've got to shut out big insurance and big pharma out of the drafting process so they cannot continue to profit off the backs of the sick people in this country who are searching and in desperate need of care.	0
Senior Harris, your response?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Well, unfortunately, Representative Gabbard got it wrong.	0
Kathleen Sebelius did not write my plan; she endorsed it as being one of the plans that is the best to get us to a place where everyone is going to have access to healthcare in America.	0
And when we talk about this again, I'm going to back to Vice President Biden, because your plan does not cover everyone in America.	0
By your staffs and your own definition, 10 million people - as many as 10 million people will not have access to healthcare.	0
And in 2019 in America, for a Democrat to be running for president with a plan that does not cover everyone, I think is without excuse.	0
Our plan covers everyone -	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
- and gives people choice	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Vice President Biden, your response?	0
My plan does - will cover everyone, number one.	0
Number two, the fact is that my plan also calls for controlling drug prices.	0
The biopharma is now where things are going to go.	0
It's no longer chemicals.	0
It's about all these breakthroughs that we have, with the whole (ph) - excuse me, immune system.	0
And what we have to do now is we have to have a form that sits in HHS and says, as you develop a drug, you got to come to us and decide what you can sell it for.	0
We will set the price.	0
And secondly, it says that you cannot raise that price beyond the cost of inflation from this point on.	0
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.	0
I want to bring in Senator Bennet.	0
Last night, on this stage, one of your democratic rivals suggested that running on Medicare for All would get Donald Trump reelected.	0
I agree that it makes it much more likely.	0
Unlike others on this stage, I've been crystal clear of where I've been for a decade, through two tough races in Colorado.	0
I believe we should finish the job we started with the Affordable Care Act with a public option that gives everybody in this audience the chance to pick for their family, whether they want private insurance or public insurance.	0
It requires the drug companies to be negotiated with by Medicare and it provides competition.	0
That is totally different from the plan that Senator Warren and Senator Sanders and Senator Harris have proposed, which would make illegal employer based health insurance in this country and massively raise taxes on the middle class to the tune of $30 trillion.	0
As Joe Biden said, we don't need to do that.	0
It doesn't make sense for us to take away insurance from half the people in this room and -- and put huge taxes on almost everybody in this room when we pass a public option, trust the American people to make the right decision, and have universal healthcare in this country in two years, not 10 years.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Secretary Castro, I want to bring you in ...	0
I -- I need to respond.	0
Your response.	0
I'll come to you right after Secretary Castro.	0
Secretary Castro.	0
Well, I know that this is something very personal for all Americans.	0
You know I grew up with a grandmother that had diabetes and I watched as her condition got worse and worse.	0
That whole time she had Medicare.	0
I want to strengthen Medicare for the people who are on it and then expand it to anybody who wants it.	0
I also believe thought that if somebody has a private health insurance plan that is strong that they want to hold on to that they should be able to do that.	0
What I don't believe is that the profit motive of big pharma or big insurance companies should ever determine, in our great nation, whether somebody gets healthcare or not.	0
Thank you, Secretary Castro.	0
Senator Harris, Senator Bennet had suggested that you support banning employer based health insurance.	0
Is that true?	0
Well first of all, with all due respect to my friend, Michael Bennet, my plan does not offer anything that is illegal.	0
What it does is it separates the employer from healthcare, meaning that where you work will not be a -- where -- the kind of healthcare you get will not be a function of where you work.	0
I have me met so many Americans who stick to a job that they do not like, where they are not prospering simply because they need the healthcare that that employer provides.	0
It's time that we separate employers from the kind of healthcare people get and under my plan; we do that as it relates to the insurance and the pharmaceutical companies ....	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Who will not be called in and who will not be taken to task by Senator Biden or Senator Bennet's plan ...	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
We will do that.	0
Senator Bennet, I want to bring you back.	0
Senator Harris is my friend as well, but I have to say if we can't admit -- if we can't admit tonight what's in the plan, which is banning employer based insurance, we're not going to be able to admit that when Donald Trump is accusing democrats of doing that as well.	0
We need to be honest about what's in this plan.	0
It bans employer based insurance and taxes the middle class to the tune of $30 trillion.	0
Do you know how much that is?	0
That is 70 percent of what the government will collect in taxes over the next 10 years.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
We don't need to do that.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
We can have a public option to have universal healthcare in this country.	0
I do want to bring in Senator Harris because he just suggested you were not being honest.	0
He -- we cannot keep with the republican talking points on this.	0
You got to stop.	0
The reality is that - what -- under my Medicare for All plan, yes, employers are not going to be able to dictate the kind of healthcare that their employees get.	0
They will be able to make that decision.	0
Private insurance companies and private carriers, if they comply by our rules and play by our rules, will be able to offer those employees healthcare coverage under a private Medicare plan or they can have the option of a public Medicare plan.	0
But it is misleading to suggest that employees want what their employer is offering only.	0
They want choice and my plan gives that to them.	0
Thank.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Governor Inslee, I want to bring you in.	0
You recently signed a public option into law, which allows Washington State residents to purchase a state backed plan if they want to.	0
But this may only save families in Washington State as little as 5 percent off premiums.	0
Is 5 percent really the kind of relief that the American people need?	0
No, we need universal coverage.	0
And I'm proud of our state that has done less squabbling and actually getting things done.	0
And I am proud that we are the first state to offer a publically sanctioned offer of healthcare to our citizens.	0
I'm also proud that we didn't stop there.	0
We're also the first state that has taken care of our elders, our seniors.	0
We have a looming retirement wave coming up.	0
I'm proud that our state -- our state has made them eligible to retire in dignity.	0
I'm also proud of this and I think we need to talk more about this as democrats, it is time to give people adequate mental healthcare in this country.	0
And we are -- we are ...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We are having -- we've had some success in integrating mental health with physical health.	0
There's no reason we should distinguish between your physiological and your mental health.	0
And the last thing we're doing, I think it's very instructive for the nation.	0
We know we're being eaten alive by pharmaceutical cost.	0
We have had one of, if not the most, innovative way to drive down pharmaceuticals for life saving medications in the United States.	0
We have had one of, if not the most innovative way to drive down pharmaceuticals for life-saving medications in the United States.	0
That's a record of Washington state I'd like to take to Washington, D.C.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, Governor Inslee.	0
Mr. Yang, I want to bring you in.	0
You support a Medicare for All system.	0
How do you respond to Governor Inslee?	0
Well, I just want to share a story.	0
When I told my wife I was running for president, you know the first question she asked me?	0
What are we going to do about our health care?	0
That's a true story, and it's not just us.	0
Democrats are talking about health care in the wrong way.	0
As someone who's run a business, I can tell you flat out our current health care system makes it harder to hire, it makes it harder to treat people well and give them benefits and treat them as full-time employees, it makes it harder to switch jobs, as Senator Harris just said, and it's certainly a lot harder to start a business.	0
If we say, look, we're going to get health care off the backs of businesses and families, then watch American entrepreneurship recover and bloom.	0
That's the argument we should be making to the American people.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Mr. Yang.	0
Mayor de Blasio?	0
Yeah, I don't understand why Democrats on this stage are fearmongering about universal health care.	0
It makes no sense.	0
Ask the American people, they are sick of what the pharmaceutical companies are doing to them.	0
Ask them what they feel about the health insurance companies.	0
They feel it's holding back their families because they can't get the coverage they need.	0
They get a lot of noes.	0
They don't get a lot of help from health insurance companies.	0
Why are we not going to be the party that does something bold, that says we don't need to be dependent on private insurance?	0
We can have a system that actually covers everyone.	0
You know what?	0
Donald Trump won this state of Michigan by saying he was going to disrupt the status quo.	0
How about we be the party that's going to disrupt the status quo for working people?	0
Thank you.	0
Mr. Mayor, just a 15-second point of clarification.	0
Who are you talking about?	0
Who's fearmongering?	0
Certainly, with all due respect to Senator Bennet, what he's saying is absolutely inaccurate about taxes.	0
Americans right now are paying so much money for their health care, ask people about the reality of premiums, deductibles, co-pays, out-of-pocket expenses.	0
Thank you.	0
That's worse than any tax, and people are paying that right now.	0
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.	0
Senator Bennet?	0
This -- this is -- this has nothing to do with Republican talking points or the pharmaceutical industry.	0
This has to do with having faith in the American people that they can make the right decisions for their families and they can choose a public option.	0
Bernie Sanders, who said last night he wrote the damn bill, and he did, just like I wrote the damn public option bill, is the guy who says it will cost $32 trillion and that we're going to have to raise those taxes to pay for it.	0
He says that.	0
Republicans don't say it.	0
Don't try to district from the truth.	0
Thank you, Senator Bennet.	0
You can't hide from the truth.	0
I want to let Mayor de Blasio -- and then I'm going to come to you, Vice President Biden.	0
We need to be for universal health care.	0
Senator, if we as Democrats say we're done with private insurance, has only hurt the American people in so many ways, we're going to give them something that works for their family's full coverage that they can depend on.	0
If we say that, then there's an election.	0
The American people get to decide.	0
The ultimate choice, Senator, is an election, and this should be the party that stands for universal health care and says we're not going to accept anything less.	0
Right now, in America, so many people don't have the health care they need.	0
That is a fact.	0
Tens of millions of people, including middle class people.	0
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.	0
Give them a chance to make that decision through an election.	0
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.	0
Vice President Biden, your response, sir?	0
This is not a Republican talking point.	0
The Republicans are trying to kill Obamacare.	0
Obamacare took care of 20 million people right off the bat, 100 million people with pre-existing conditions.	0
And in fact, what we got is a public option that, in fact, would allow anybody to buy in.	0
No one has to keep their private insurance.	0
They can buy into this plan.	0
And they can buy into it with $1,000 deductible and never have to pay more than 8.5 percent of their income when they do it.	0
And if they don't have any money, they'll get in free.	0
So this idea is a bunch of malarkey, what we're talking about here.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
The fact of the matter is -- the fact of the matter is that there will be a deductible.	0
It will be a deductible on their paycheck.	0
Bernie acknowledges it.	0
Bernie acknowledges it.	0
Thirty trillion dollars has to ultimately be paid.	0
And I don't know what math you do in New York, I don't know what math you do in California, but I tell ya, that's a lot of money, and there will be a deductible.	0
The deductible will be out of your paycheck, because that's what will be required.	0
Senator Harris, I want to bring you in here.	0
Your response?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Yeah, let's talk about math.	0
Let's talk about math.	0
Let's talk about the fact that the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies last year alone profited $72 billion, and that is on the backs of American families.	0
And under your plan, status quo, you do nothing to hold the insurance companies to task for what they have been doing to American families.	0
In America today, diabetes patients, one in four cannot afford their insulin.	0
In America today...	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
... for those people who have overdosed from an opioid, there is a syringe that costs $4,000 that will save their life.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
It is immoral.	0
It is untenable.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
And it must change with Medicare for All.	0
Your time is up, Senator.	0
Vice President Biden, your response?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Real quick.	0
I have the only plan that limits the ability of insurance companies to charge unreasonable prices, flat out, number one.	0
Number two, we should put some of these insurance executives who totally oppose my plan in jail for of the $9 billion opioids they sell out there.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
They are misrepresenting to the American people what needs to be done.	0
And, lastly, here's the deal.	0
The deal is, let's figure out how this works.	0
We immediately are able to cover everybody who wants to get off of their insurance plan they don't like, no matter what one it is, and buy into a Medicare option.	0
And they can buy the gold plan, and they're not going to have to pay -- anyway...	0
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.	0
Thank you.	0
Let's move now to immigration, please.	0
Secretary Castro, you think it should no longer be a crime to cross the U.S. border illegally.	0
"President Obama's homeland security secretary, Jeh Johnson, whom you served with, says that is a public declaration that the border is, quote, ""effectively open to all."""	0
How is he wrong?	0
Thank you for that question.	0
You know, if you elect me president, you're not electing me to follow.	0
You're electing me to lead.	0
And open borders is a right-wing talking point, and frankly I'm disappointed that some folks, including some folks on this stage, have taken the bait.	0
The only way that we're going to guarantee that we don't have family separations in this country again is to repeal Section 1325 of the Immigration Nationality Act.	0
That is the law that this president, this administration is using to incarcerate migrant parents and then physically separate them from their children.	0
My immigration plan would also make sure that we put undocumented immigrants who haven't committed a serious crime on a pathway to citizenship, that we do a 21st century Marshall Plan with Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, so that we can get to the root of this challenge so people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of having to come to the United States.	0
That's how we can be smarter, more effective, and more humane when it comes to immigration policy.	0
Thank you, Secretary Castro.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Bennet, what's your response?	0
I disagree that we should decriminalize our border.	0
This is personal for me.	0
My mom is an immigrant, and she was separated from her parents during the Holocaust in Poland.	0
And for those reasons, I was part of the Gang of Eight that wrote -- I wrote the immigration bill in 2013 with John McCain that passed the Senate with 68 votes, that gave a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented people that are here, that would pass the most progressive DREAM Act that had ever been conceived, much less passed on the floor of the Senate, and had $46 billion of border security.	0
Every single Democrat voted for that bill...	0
Senator...	0
... and a lot of Republicans.	0
That should be our position.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
That is our position as Democrats.	0
Senator Harris, you have indicated that you don't think it should be a criminal offense punishable by jail to cross the U.S. border illegally.	0
How do you respond to Senator Bennet?	0
Well, again, with all due respect, you know, I -- after the last debate, for example, I went to a place in Florida called Homestead, and there is a private detention facility being paid for by your taxpayer dollars, a private detention facility that currently houses 2,700 children.	1
And by the way, there were members of us -- Julian was there, members of Congress, they would not let us enter the place, members of the United States Congress.	0
So I walked down the road, I climbed a ladder, and I looked over the fence.	0
And I'm going to tell you what I saw.	0
I saw children lined up single file based on gender being walked into barracks.	0
The policies of this administration have been facilitated by laws on the books...	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
... that allow them to be incarcerated as though they've committed crimes.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
These children have not committed crimes...	0
Thank you, Senator Harris.	0
... and should be not treated like criminals.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Bennet, what's your response?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I think this is one in the end that we agree with.	0
There's not a single person on this stage if we were president would ever separate a child from their parents at the border.	0
And that is what this...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
That is what this administration has done in the American people's name.	0
They have turned our border into a symbol of nativist hostility.	0
The symbol of this country before Donald Trump was president was the Statue of Liberty.	0
That should be the symbol of the United States of America, not Donald Trump's words.	0
Thank you, Senator Bennet.	0
Senator Gillibrand, I want to bring you in.	0
What's your response?	0
So I think when you talk about whether this should be a crime, you have to remember who we're talking about.	0
When I was at the Texas border, I visited with women who had fled violence.	0
A woman from El Salvador owned a small business, gangs came to her and said if you don't give us all your money, we're going to kill your family.	0
That's why she fled.	0
Another woman was raped.	0
That's why she fled.	0
So this is who we're talking about -- and they're not criminals.	0
So I believe that we should have a civil violation.	0
No president before President Trump enforced the law in the way he has enforced it.	0
Because he's using it as the crutch to lock up women and children, to separate mothers and babies, to put them behind bars.	0
So I don't think we should have a law on the books that can be so misused.	0
It should be a civil violation and we should make sure that we treat people humanely.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Vice President Biden, in the first two years of the Obama administration, nearly 800,000 immigrants were deported, far more than during President Trump's first two years.	0
Would the higher deportation rates resume if you were president?	0
Absolutely not, number one.	0
Number two, everything landed on the president's desk but locusts.	0
I found that Julian -- excuse me -- the secretary, we sat together in many meetings.	0
I never heard him talk about any of this when he was the secretary.	0
Three million (ph) (inaudible)	0
Please be respectful.	0
Please be respectful in the crowd.	0
Three million (ph) (inaudible)	0
Please continue, Mr. Vice President.	0
Three million (ph) (inaudible)	0
The fact is -- the fact is...	0
Three million (ph) (inaudible)	0
I don't know if you can hear.	0
I can hear.	0
But anyway...	0
We can hear fine, Mr. Vice President.	0
OK.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
Please continue, if you will.	0
The fact is what the senator from New York talked about is seeking asylum.	0
That woman, the women she spoke to are entitled to asylum.	0
That is not crossing the border illegally.	0
What we should do is flood the zone to make sure we have people to make those decisions quickly.	0
With regard to -- with regard to the secretary's point, I already proposed and passed...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... $750 million for Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, to be able to change the circumstance why people fled in the first place.	0
In addition to that, we're in a circumstance where if in fact you say you can just cross the border, what do you say to all those people around the world who in fact want the same thing to come to the United States and make their case, that they don't -- that they have to wait in line.	0
The fact of the matter is, you should be able to -- if you cross the border illegally, you should be able to be sent back.	0
It's a crime.	0
It's a crime, and it's not one that in fact...	0
Thank -- thank you, Mr. Vice President.	0
Secretary Castro, please, your response?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Yeah, first of all, Mr. Vice President, it looks like one of us has learned the lessons of the past and one of us hasn't.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Let me begin by telling you -- let me just start out by answering that question.	0
My immigration plan would also fix the broken legal immigration system, because we do have a problem with that.	0
I agree.	0
Secondly, the only way that we're going to guarantee that these kinds of family separations don't happen in the future is that we need to repeal this law.	0
There's still going to be consequences if somebody crosses the border.	0
It's a civil action.	0
Also, we have 654 miles of fencing.	0
We have thousands of personnel at the border.	0
We have planes; we have boats; we have helicopters; we have security cameras...	0
Secretary Castro, thank you.	0
What we need are politicians that actually...	0
Your time is up.	0
... have some guts on this issue.	0
Thank you, Secretary.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Mr. Vice President, please, your response?	0
I have guts enough to say his plan doesn't make sense.	0
Here's the deal.	0
The fact of the matter is that, in fact, when people cross the border illegally, it is illegal to do it unless they're seeking asylum.	0
People should have to get in line.	0
That's the problem.	0
And the only reason this particular part of the law is being abused is because of Donald Trump.	0
We should defeat Donald Trump and end this practice.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you.	0
Congresswoman Gabbard, what's your response?	0
Our hearts break when we see those children at these detention facilities who've been separated from their parents, when we see human beings crowded into cages in abhorrent, inhumane conditions.	0
This is about leadership and understanding that we can and should have both secure borders as well as humane immigration policies.	0
We will have to stop separating children from their parents, make it so that it's easier for people to seek asylum in this country, make sure that we are securing our borders and making it so that people are able to use our legal immigration system by reforming those laws.	0
Mr. Yang, your response?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I'm the son of immigrants myself.	0
My father immigrated here as a graduate student and generated over 65 U.S. patents for G.E.	0
and IBM.	0
I think that's a pretty good deal for the United States.	0
That's the immigration story we need to be telling.	0
We can't always be focusing on some of the -- the -- the distressed stories.	0
And if you go to a factory here in Michigan, you will not find wall-to-wall immigrants; you will find wall-to-wall robots and machines.	0
Immigrants are being scapegoated for issues they have nothing to do with in our economy.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Mr. Yang.	0
"Senator Booker you have a plan that would, quote, ""virtually eliminate immigration detention."""	0
Does that mean that the roughly 55,000 migrants currently in detention would be released into the United States?	0
Well, first of all, I just want to say, again, tonight, we are playing into Republican hands who have a very different view, and they're trying to divide us against each other.	0
I'm listening to the language of my colleagues.	0
No, Mr. Vice President, we are not going to just let people cross the border.	0
An unlawful crossing is an unlawful crossing, if you do it in the civil courts, or if you do in the criminal courts.	0
But the criminal courts is what is giving Donald Trump the ability to truly violate the human rights of people coming to our country, who no one surrenders their human rights.	0
And so, doing it through the civil courts means that you won't need these awful detention facilities that I have been to; seeing children sleeping on pavement, people being put in cages, nursing mothers, small children.	0
This is not necessary.	0
We have seen, using the civil system, piloted programs that have 100 percent compliance with the civil courts, where people are evaluated.	0
If they have no justifiable reason to be here, they are returned.	0
If they are, like the people I met in Juarez, who were survivors of sexual assault, who we wouldn't even let come and present for asylum.	0
We are butchering our values -	0
Senator -	0
- and making ourselves less safe.	0
Senator Booker, thank you very much.	0
Mr. Vice President, your response?	0
I agree with the Senator.	0
The asylum process is a real process, and this president is ruining it.	0
It has nothing to do with that section of law.	0
That's what he's doing, number one.	0
Number two, we should in fact - and we had proposed and we tried to get passed in our administration, I proposed, significantly increasing the number of legal immigrants who are able to come.	0
This country can tolerate a heck of a lot more people.	0
And the reason we're the country we are is we've been able to cherry pick from the best of every culture.	0
Immigrants built this country.	0
That's why we're so special.	0
It took courage.	0
It took resilience.	0
It took absolutely confidence for them to come.	0
And we should be encouraging these people.	0
Thank you.	0
And by the way, anybody that crosses the stage with a - with a - with a PhD, you should get a green card for seven years.	0
We should keep them here.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President.	0
Governor Inslee, what's your response?	0
I think we're missing two central statements we need to make.	0
Number one, we can no longer allow a white nationalist to be in the White House, number one.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And number two - number two, we have to make America what it's always been, a place of refuge.	0
We got to boost the number of people we accept.	0
I'm proud of being the first governor saying send us your Syrian refugees.	0
I'm proud to have been the first governor to stand up against Donald Trump's Muslim ban.	0
I'm proud to have sued him 21 times and beat him 21 times in a row.	0
I'm ready for November 2020.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Go ahead.	0
Mayor de Blasio, please your response?	0
Two points.	0
One, it's all kind of charade because there's 11 million people here, and everyone, in theory, has broken the law, but they're part of our communities now.	0
They're part of our economy.	0
They're our neighbors.	0
Why are we even discussing on one level whether it's a civil penalty or a criminal penalty, when it's an American reality?	0
And what we need is comprehensive immigration, once and for all, to fix it.	0
Second, Vice President Biden, I didn't hear your response when the issue came up of all those deportations.	0
You were vice president of the United States.	0
I didn't hear whether you tried to stop them or not, using your power, your influence in the White House.	0
Do you think it was a good idea, or do you think it was something that needed to be stopped?	0
Mr. Vice President -	0
The president came along, and he's the guy that came up with the idea the first time ever, dealing with the dreamers.	0
He put that in the law.	0
He had talked about a comprehensive plan which he put on the - laid before the Congress, saying that we should find a pathway to citizenship for people.	0
He said we should up the number of people that we're able to bring in to this country.	0
Lastly, he also pointed out that we should go to the source of the problem and fix it where people were leaving in the first place.	0
So he did - to compare him to Donald Trump, I think is absolutely bizarre.	0
Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President.	0
Congresswoman Gabbard, you are a co-sponsor of the College for All Act which would make public colleges and universities free for all Americans.	0
One of the authors of that plan, Senator Sanders, believes college should be tuition-free for undocumented immigrants as well.	0
Do you?	0
I don't.	0
I think it's important for us to fix our legal immigration system and look at the millions of undocumented immigrants in this country who have been suffering as they've been living in the shadows.	0
And instead of putting a band-aid on this problem, fix our legal immigration system to provide them with that pathway to legal residency or citizenships, that they are no longer treated as second-class citizens in this country.	0
We've got to look at the challenge that people all across the country are facing, under crushing student debt.	0
This is something that is impacting my generation in a huge way and I believe that it is our generation that has the bold, creative solutions to be able to solve it.	0
This is about promise for our future and we've got to make those kinds of investments.	0
Thank you, Congresswoman.	0
Mayor de Blasio, what's your response?	0
Yes, I -- I agree with the congress member but I don't hear an answer from the vice president.	0
I'm confused.	0
I asked the vice president point blank, did he use his power to stop those deportations.	0
He went right around the question.	0
Mr. Vice President, you want to be president of the United States, you need to be able to answer the tough questions.	0
I guarantee you if you're debating Donald Trump he's not going to let you off the hook.	0
So did you say those deportations were a good idea or did you go to the president and say this is a mistake, we shouldn't do it.	0
Which one?	0
I was vice president.	0
I am not the president.	0
I keep my recommendation to him in private.	0
Unlike you I can expect you would go ahead and say whatever was said privately with him.	0
That is not what I do.	0
What I do say to you is he moved to fundamentally change the system.	0
That's what he did.	0
That's who did.	0
But much more has to be done.	0
Much more has to be done.	0
I still don't hear an answer.	0
Senator Booker, please respond.	0
Well, a couple of things.	0
First of all, Mr. Vice President, you can't have it both ways.	0
You invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign.	0
You can't do it when it's convenient and then dodge it when it's not.	0
And the second thing that this really urkes (ph) me because I heard the vice president say that if you got a PhD., you can come right into this country.	0
Well that's playing into what the republicans want, to pit some immigrants against other immigrants.	0
From are from shithole countries and some are from worthy countries.	0
We need to reform this whole immigration system and begin to be the country that says everyone has worth and dignity and this should be a country that honors for everyone.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Don't let the republicans divide this party against itself.	0
Senator, thank you.	0
Mr. Vice President, your response.	0
The fact is that's what I said about this country.	0
We are a country of immigrants.	0
All of us.	0
All of us.	0
Some here came against their will; others came because they in fact thought they could fundamentally change their lives.	0
And they did.	0
(Inaudible) that's what we're talking about.	0
That's what made us great.	0
And the fact of the matter is, I think the president of the United States, Barack Obama, went out of his way to try to change the system and he got pushed back significantly.	0
Senator Gillibrand, what's your response?	0
Again, President Trump, under his administration seven children died in his custody.	0
In -- under his administration families have been torn apart.	0
This party is talking about real ideas for the future.	0
We're talking about what we will do to change America.	0
But we must not forget about our values.	0
We used to believe in this country you should treat others the way you want to be treated.	0
We used to believe in this country we should care about the least among us.	0
Let's remind the American people who we are, why we are democrats, and why we're running for president.	0
Senator Gillibrand, thank you very much.	0
The debate will be right back right after this short break.	0
Welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate.	0
We are live from Detroit.	0
I want to turn now to criminal justice.	0
"Mr. Vice President, Senator Booker called your new criminal justice reform plan, quote, ""an inadequate solution to what is a raging crisis in our country,"" unquote."	0
Why is Senator Booker wrong?	0
Well, I don't -- I think he is wrong.	0
I think we should work together.	0
He has a similar plan.	0
I think that we should change the way we look at prisons.	0
Right now, we're in a situation where, when someone is convicted of a drug crime, they end up going to jail and to prison.	0
They should be going to rehabilitation.	0
They shouldn't be going to prison.	0
When in prison, they should be learning to read and write and not just sit in there and learn how to be better criminals.	0
And when they get out of prison, they should be in a situation where they have access to everything they would have had before, including Pell grants for education, including making sure that they're able to have housing, public housing, including they have all the opportunities that were available to them because we want them to become better citizens.	0
That's the essence of what my plan, in detail, lays out.	0
I'm happy to discuss it more in detail if the senator would want to.	0
And so I -- you know, I look -- anyway, that's what I think my plan -- I know what my plan does, and I think it's not dissimilar to what the senator said we should be working together on getting things done.	0
Senator Booker, your response?	0
Well, my response is that this is a crisis in our country because we have treated issues of race and poverty, mental health and addiction with locking people up and not lifting them up.	0
And...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... Mr. Vice President has said that, since the 1970s, every major crime bill -- every crime bill, major and minor, has had his name on it.	0
And, Sir, those are your words, not -- not mine.	0
And this is one of those instances where the house was set on fire and you claimed responsibility for those laws.	0
And you can't just now come out with a plan to put out that fire.	0
We have got to have far more bold action on criminal justice reform, like having true...	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
... marijuana justice, which means that we legalize it on a federal level...	0
Thank you, Senator Booker.	0
... and reinvest the profits in communities that have been...	0
Thank you, Senator Booker.	0
... disproportionately targeted by marijuana enforcement.	0
Vice President Biden, I want to give you a chance to respond.	0
The fact is that the bills that the president -- that, excuse me, the future president here -- that...	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
... that the senator is talking about are bills that were passed years ago and they were passed overwhelming.	0
Since 2007, I, for example, tried to get the crack-powder-cocaine totally -- disparity totally eliminated.	0
In 2007 you became mayor and you had a police department that was -- you went out and you hired Rudy Giuliani's guy; you -- and engaged in stop-and-frisk.	0
You had 75 percent of those stops reviewed as illegal.	0
You found yourself in a situation where three times as many African-American kids were caught in that chain and caught up.	0
The Justice Department came after you for saying you were -- you were engaging in behavior that was inappropriate, and then in fact nothing happened, the entire time you were mayor.	0
Thank you.	0
Senator Booker, you want to respond?	0
Well, first of all, I'm grateful that he endorsed my presidency already.	0
But I'll tell you this, it's no secret that I inherited a criminal -- a police department with massive problems and decades-long challenges.	0
But the head of the ACLU has already said -- the head of the New Jersey ACLU -- that I put forth national standard-setting accountability.	0
That's...	0
Mr. Vice President -- Mr. Vice President, I didn't interrupt you.	0
Please show me that respect, sir.	0
I'm sorry (inaudible)	0
We have a system right now that's broken.	0
And if you want to compare records -- and, frankly, I'm shocked that you do...	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
...	0
I am happy to do that.	0
Because all the problems that he is talking about, that he created, I actually led the bill that got passed into law that reverses the damage that your bills that you were, frankly -- to correct you, Mr. Vice President -- you were bragging, calling it the Biden crime bill, up until 2015.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Vice President Biden?	0
Number one, the bill he talks about is a bill that in my -- our administration, we passed.	0
We passed that bill that you added onto.	0
That's the bill, in fact, you passed.	0
And the fact of the matter is, secondly, there was nothing done for the entire eight years he was mayor, there was nothing done to deal with the police department that was corrupt.	0
Why did you announce on the first day a zero tolerance policy of stop and frisk and hire Rudy Giuliani's guy in 2007, when I was trying to get rid of the crack cocaine disparity?	0
Mr. Vice President, there's a saying in my community, you're dipping into the Kool-Aid and you don't even know the flavor.	0
You need to come to the city of Newark and see the reforms that we put in place.	0
The New Jersey head of the ACLU has said that I embraced reforms not just in action, but in deeds.	0
Sir, you are trying to shift the view from what you created.	0
"There are people right now in prison for life for drug offenses because you stood up and used that ""tough on crime"" phony rhetoric that got a lot of people elected but destroyed communities like mine."	0
This isn't about the past, sir.	0
This is about the present right now.	0
I believe in redemption.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
I'm happy you evolved.	0
I want to bring in Secretary...	0
But you've offered no redemption to the people in prison right now for life.	0
I want to bring in Secretary Castro.	0
Your response, sir?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Yeah, I agree with Senator Booker -- I agree with Senator Booker that a lot of what Vice President helped author in '94 was a mistake.	0
And he has flip-flopped on these things.	0
And that's clear.	0
But let me say, when we talk about criminal justice reform, there are a lot of things that we can talk about -- sentencing reform, cash bail reform, investing in public defenders, diversion programs.	0
I'm proud that I'm the only candidate that has put forward a police reform plan, because we have a police system that is broken and we need to fix it.	0
And whether it's the case of someone like Tamir Rice or Michael Brown or Eric Garner, where the Trump Justice Department just decided not to pursue challenges...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... we need to ensure we have a national use of force standard and that we end qualified immunity for police officers so that we can hold them accountable for using excessive force.	0
Thank you, Secretary Castro.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
I want to bring in -- I want to bring in Governor Inslee.	0
Governor Inslee, your response?	0
Let me suggest that people come out to the state of Washington and see what criminal justice reform looks like, our effort to reduce racial disparity.	0
I'm proud that I was the first governor to offer pardons to thousands of people with drug crimes.	0
Now we're vacating more, tens of thousands.	0
We've eliminated the death penalty.	0
When people come out of the legal system and they've done their responsibility to the citizens, we need to make sure they can get a job.	0
We have banned the box so that people can actually get a job when they come out.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And I've got to argue with my friend, Secretary Castro.	0
We haven't just put forward a plan.	0
We have adopted probably one of the best police accountability measures and trainer police officers and de-escalation techniques so we have less violence...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Secretary -- Secretary Castro, your response to Governor Inslee?	0
Well, that it's much more than that, because what we see -- and this was a good example, the other day, of the Department of Justice not going after Officer Pantaleo that -- Officer Pantaleo used a chokehold that was prohibited by NYPD.	0
He did that for seven seconds.	0
Eleven different times Eric Garner said that he couldn't breathe.	0
He knew what he was doing, that he was killing Eric Garner, and yet he has not been brought to justice.	0
That police officer should be off the street.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Mayor de Blasio?	0
Mayor de Blasio, why is that police officer still on the force, the one who killed Eric Garner?	0
Please respond.	0
Well, let me tell you.	0
I know the Garner family.	0
They've gone through extraordinary pain.	0
They are waiting for justice and are going to get justice.	0
There's finally going to be justice.	0
I have confidence in that, in the next 30 days, in New York.	0
You know why?	0
Because for the first time, we are not waiting on the federal Justice Department, which told the city of New York that we could not proceed because the Justice Department was pursuing their prosecution.	0
And years went by, and a lot of the pain accrued.	0
And in the meantime, what I'm working on is making sure -- and I have for five years -- there will never be another tragedy, there will never be another Eric Garner, because we're changing fundamentally how we police.	0
Thank you, Mayor.	0
But there's one last point I have to say about the Justice Department.	0
The vice president for two-and-a-half of those years, Mr. Vice President, tell us, what did you do to try and spur on the Justice Department to act in the Garner case?	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, Mayor.	0
Thank you, Mayor de Blasio.	0
Vice President Biden, you can respond to that.	0
We did a lot.	0
Number one, we made sure we reduced the federal prison population by 38,000 people, number one.	0
Number two, we, in fact, insisted that we change the rules that police engage in.	0
They had to have -- we provided for body cameras.	0
We made sure -- there were a lot of things that were changed in the process, but 38,000 people in the federal system were released under the system.	0
And so the fact is that there's a lot we've done.	0
But here's the deal.	0
The fact is that we're talking about things that occurred a long, long time ago.	0
And now, all of a sudden, you know -- I find it fascinating.	0
Everybody is talking about how terrible I am on these issues.	0
Barack Obama knew exactly who I was.	0
He had 10 lawyers do a background check on everything about me on civil rights and civil liberties, and he chose me, and he said it was the best decision he made.	0
I'll take his judgment.	0
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.	0
May I, please?	0
Mr. Yang, your response?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I speak for just about everyone watching when I say I would trust anyone on this stage much more than I would trust our current president on matters of criminal justice.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We cannot tear each other down.	0
We have to focus on beating Donald Trump in 2020.	0
I want to share a story that a prison guard, a corrections officer in New Hampshire said to me.	0
He said, we should pay people to stay out of jail, because we spend so much when they're behind bars.	0
Right now, we think we're saving money, we just end up spending the money in much more dark and punitive ways.	0
We should put money directly into people's hands, certainly when they come out of prison, but before they go into prison.	0
Thank you, Mr. Yang.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I want to bring in Senator Gillibrand.	0
You heard earlier Mayor de Blasio respond to Secretary Castro on the question of why the police officer who killed Eric Garner is still on the NYPD.	0
Was that response adequate?	0
Please respond.	0
No.	0
He should be fired.	0
He should be fired now.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I sat -- I sat down with Eric Garner's mother.	0
"And I can tell you, when you've lost your son, when he begged for breath, when you know because you have a video, when you know he said ""I can't breathe"" so many times, over and over again, when you know he used an illegal chokehold, that person should be fired."	0
And as -- if I was -- if I was the mayor, I would fire him.	0
But as president, I would make sure that we had a full investigation, that the report would be made public.	0
And if I wasn't satisfied, we would have a consent decree.	0
I want to bring in Senator Harris now.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Harris, you have also been quite critical of Vice President Biden's policies on race, specifically on the issues of busing in the 1970s, having benefitted from busing when you were a young child.	0
Vice President Biden says that your current position on busing, you're opposed to federally mandated busing, that that position is the same as his position.	0
Is he right?	0
That is simply false.	0
And let's be very clear about this.	0
When Vice President Biden was in the United States Senate, working with segregationists to oppose busing, which was the vehicle by which we would integrate America's public schools, had I been in the United States Senate at that time, I would have been completely on the other side of the aisle.	0
And let's be clear about this.	0
Had those segregationists their way, I would not be a member of the United States Senate, Cory Booker would not be a member of the United States Senate, and Barack Obama would not have been in the position to nominate him to the title he now holds.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And so, on that issue, we could not be more apart, which is that the vice president has still failed to acknowledge that it was wrong to take the position that he took at that time.	0
Now, I would like to also talk about this conversation about Eric Garner, because I, too, met with his mother.	0
And one of the things that we've got to be clear about is that this president of the United States, Donald Trump, while he has been in office, has quietly been allowing the United States Department of Justice to shut down consent decrees, to stop pattern and practice investigations.	0
On that case, we also know that the...	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
... Civil Rights Division -- this is important.	0
The Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice said charges should have been filed, but this United States Department of Justice usurped -- and I believe it is because that president did not want those charges to go forward.	0
And they overrode a decision by the Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Under my administration, the Civil Rights Division...	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
... will rein and there will be independent investigations.	0
Vice President Biden, Vice President Biden, I want to give you a chance to respond to what Senator Harris just said.	0
When Senator Harris was attorney general for eight years in the state of California, there were two of the most segregated school districts in the country, in Los Angeles and in San Francisco.	0
And she did not -- I didn't see a single solitary time she brought a case against them to desegregate them.	0
Secondly, she also was in a situation where she had a police department when she was there that in fact was abusing people's right.	0
And the fact was that she in fact was told by her own people that her own staff that she should do something about and disclose to defense attorney's like me that you in fact have been -- the police officer did something that did not give you information of what (inaudible) your -- your client.	0
She didn't do that.	0
She never did it.	0
And so what happened.	0
Along came a federal judge and said enough, enough.	0
And he freed 1,000 of these people.	0
If you doubt me, google 1,000 prisoners freed, Kamala Harris.	0
Thank you, Vice President Biden.	0
Senator Harris, your response.	0
That is -- is simply not true.	0
And as attorney general of California where I ran the second largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice, I am proud of the work we did.	0
Work that has received national recognition for what has been the important work of reforming a criminal justice system and cleaning up the consequences of the bills that you passed when you were in the United States Senate for decades.	0
It was the work of creating the -- one of the first in the nation initiatives around reentering former offenders and getting them jobs and counseling.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
I did the work as attorney general of putting body cameras on special agents in the state of California.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
I want to bring in Congresswoman ....	0
And I'm proud of that work.	0
I want to bring in Congresswoman Gabbard.	0
Congresswoman Gabbard, you took issue with Senator Harris confronting Vice President Biden at the last debate.	0
You called it a quote, false accusation that Joe Biden is a racist.	0
What's your response?	0
I want to bring the conversation back to the broken criminal justice system that is disproportionately negatively impacting black and brown people all across this country today.	0
Now Senator Harris says she's proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she'll be a prosecutor president.	0
But I'm deeply concerned about this record.	0
There are too many examples to cite but she put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
She blocked evidence -- she blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so.	0
She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of California.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And she fought to keep ...	0
Thank you, Congresswoman.	0
Bail system in place that impacts poor people in the worst kind of way.	0
Thank you, Congresswoman.	0
Senator Harris, your response?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
As the elected attorney general of California, I did the work of significantly reforming the criminal justice system of a state of 40 million people, which became a national model for the work that needs to be done.	0
And I am proud of that work.	0
And I am proud of making a decision to not just give fancy speeches or be in a legislative body and give speeches on the floor, but actually doing the work of being in the position to use the power that I had to reform a system that is badly in need of reform.	0
That is why we created initiatives that were about reentering former offenders and getting them counseling.	0
Thank you.	0
It is why (ph) and because I know that criminal justice system is so broken ...	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
That I am an advocate for what we need to do to not only decriminalize, but legalize marijuana in the United States.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Your time is up.	0
I want to -- I want to bring Congresswoman Gabbard back in.	0
Your response, please (ph).	0
The bottom line is, Senator Harris, when you were in a position to make a difference and an impact in these people's lives, you did not.	0
And worse yet, in the case of those who were on death row, innocent people, you actually blocked evidence from being revealed that would have freed them until you were forced to do so.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
There is no excuse for that and the people who suffered under your reign as prosecutor owe -- you owe them an apology.	0
Senator Harris?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
My entire career I have been opposed -- personally opposed to the death penalty and that has never changed.	0
And I dare anybody who is in a position to make that decision, to face the people I have faced to say I will not seek the death penalty.	0
That is my background, that is my work.	0
I am proud of it.	0
I think you can judge people by when they are under fire and it's not about some fancy opinion on a stage but when they're in the position to actually make a decision, what do they do.	0
When I was in the position of having to decide whether or not to seek a death penalty on cases I prosecuted, I made a very difficult decision that was not popular to not seek the death penalty.	0
History shows that and I am proud of those decisions.	0
Senator Harris, thank you very much.	0
Senator Bennet, a question for you.	0
Why are you the best candidate to heal the racial divide that exists in this country today, which has been stoked by the president's racist rhetoric?	0
Yes.	0
First of all, the president's racist rhetoric should be enough grounds for everybody in this country to vote him out of office.	0
That one thing alone should be enough.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Second, Don, I want to answer your question by tagging on the conversation we were just having.	0
This is the fourth debate that we have had and the second time that we have been debating what people did 50 years ago with busing...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... when our schools are as segregated today as they were 50 years ago.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We need a conversation about what's happening now.	0
And when there's a group of kids in this country that don't get preschool through no fault of their own and another group does, equal is not equal.	0
And we've got a group of K-12 schools that are good because families can spend a million bucks, and you've got the Detroit public schools that are as segregated as they were.	0
Equal is not equal.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And let me tell you something else, Don.	0
I believe you can draw a straight line from slavery through Jim Crow through the banking and the redlining to the mass incarceration that we were talking about on this stage a few minutes ago.	0
But you know what other line I can draw?	0
Eighty-eight percent of the people in our prisons dropped out of high school.	0
Let's fix our school system and maybe we can fix the prison pipeline that we have.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Senator Bennet.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Governor Inslee, what's your response?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Governor Inslee, please respond.	0
You know, I approach this question with humility because I have not experienced what many Americans have.	0
I've never been a black teenager pulled over in a white neighborhood.	0
I've never been a woman talked over in a meeting.	0
I've never been an LGBTQ member subject to a slur.	0
And so I have believed I have an added responsibility, a double responsibility, to deal with racial disparity.	0
And we've talked on the way we do it, including ending -- ending the school to prison pipeline in my state.	0
But I want to say this.	0
And this is a common error that every single senator on this stage, as much as I respect them all -- they all have an enormous error which is going to prevent our party from making any progressive progress in the United States, and it is this.	0
We are all going to work like the dickens to get more Democrats elected to the Senate, right?	0
We are going to do that.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And I hope we're going to succeed.	0
But if we get a majority in the U.S. Senate, because of the position of these senators, not a damn thing is going to get done.	0
And I'll tell you why.	0
With all their good intentions -- and I know they're very sincere and passionate and I respect them enormously -- but because they embraced this antediluvinal (sic) super-majority thing called the filibuster, Mitch McConnell is going to run the U.S. Senate even if we take a majority.	0
Thank you.	0
We've got to get rid of the filibuster so we can govern the United States.	0
Mister...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Mr. Yang, why are you the best candidate to heal the racial divide in America -- your response?	0
I spent seven years running a non-profit that helped create thousands of jobs, including hundreds right here in Detroit, as well as Baltimore, Cleveland, New Orleans.	0
And I saw that the racial disparities are much, much worse than I had ever imagined.	0
They're even worse still.	0
A study just came out that projected the average African-American median net worth will be zero by 2053.	0
So you have to ask yourself, how is that possible?	0
It's possible because we're in the midst of the greatest economic transformation in our history.	0
Artificial intelligence is coming.	0
It's going to displace hundreds of thousands of call center workers, truck drivers -- the most common job in 29 states, including this one.	0
And you know who suffers most in a natural disaster?	0
It's people of color, people who have lower levels of capital and education and resources.	0
So what are we going to do about it?	0
"We should just go back to the writings of Martin Luther King, who in 1967, his book ""Chaos or Community"", said ""We need a guaranteed minimum income in the United States of America."""	0
That is the most effective way for us to address racial inequality in a genuine way and give every American a chance in the 21st Century economy.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Mr. Yang, thank you very much.	0
"Secretary Castro, after the president's racist tweets attacking Baltimore and Congressman Elijah Cummings, the mayor of Baltimore slammed the tweets and said to the president -- and I quote here -- ""Help us."	0
"Send the resources that we need to rebuild America."""	0
So what would you do for Baltimore and other cities that need help?	0
First of all, the president is a racist, and that was just one more example of it.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We know that, whether it's Baltimore or cities like Detroit, they have -- they're tremendously rich in history and culture and also in possibility.	0
Here's what I would do if I'm president.	0
Number one, I would invest in tremendous educational opportunity; invest in universal pre-K for three and four-year-olds; invest in improving K-12 education and also making higher education available to everyone through tuition-free public state universities, community colleges and job training and certification programs.	0
I would follow-up on the work that I did at HUD.	0
We passed the most sweeping rule to further desegregate our communities in the United States.	0
This Trump administration set that back.	0
I would put that back in order.	0
I would also invest in housing that is affordable, because folks know that the rent is going through the roof.	0
And we need to make sure that you don't have to get out of West Baltimore, or Inner City Detroit, or the west side of San Antonio, or anywhere, if you want to reach your American dream.	0
I want you to be able to accomplish it in your great neighborhood where you are.	0
Thank you, Secretary Castro.	0
Senator Gillibrand, what's your response?	0
So I don't believe that it's the responsibility of Cory and Kamala to be the only voice that takes on these issues of institutional racism, systemic racism in our country.	0
I think as a white woman of privilege, who is a U.S. senator, running for president of the United States, it is also my responsibility to lift up those voices that aren't being listened to.	0
And I can talk to those white women in the suburbs that voted for Trump and explain to them what white privilege actually is, that when their son is walking down a street with a bag of M&Ms in his pocket, wearing a hoodie, his whiteness is what protects him from not being shot.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
When his - when her - when their child has a car that breaks down, and he knocks on someone's door for help, and the door opens, and the help is given, it's his whiteness that protects him from being shot.	0
That is what white privilege in America is today.	0
And so, my responsibility's to only lift up those stories, but explain to communities across America, like I did in Youngstown, Ohio, to a young mother, that this is all of our responsibilities, and that together we can make our community stronger.	0
Thank you, Senator Gillibrand.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Let's now turn to the issue of the climate crisis.	0
The United Nations says the world needs to cut all carbon emissions by 2050 or risk facing disastrous consequences.	0
Governor Inslee, many of your fellow democratic candidates say that climate change is the biggest existential threat facing the country.	0
You, though, are calling it the number one priority in your campaign.	0
What do you know that the others don't?	0
Well, I know the firsthand terrific impact of climate change on Americans across the country already.	0
The family who I saw, with their aluminum home now, just a pile of molten aluminum, they lost everything in the paradise of fires; the non-profit in Davenport that was washed away in the floods.	0
We have to act now.	0
Look, climate change is not a singular issue, it is all the issue that we Democrats care about.	0
It is health.	0
It is national security.	0
It is our economy.	0
And we know this; middle ground solutions, like the vice president has proposed, or sort of middling average-sized things, are not going to save us.	0
Too little, too late is too dangerous.	0
"And we have to have a bold plan, and mine has been called the ""gold standard."""	0
Now, we also need to embed environmental justice.	0
I was in zip code 48217 in the Detroit neighborhood the other day, right next to an oil refinery, where the kids have asthma and they have cancer clusters.	0
And after talking to these folks, I believe this -	0
Thank you -	0
I believe this; it doesn't matter what your zip code is -	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
- it doesn't matter what your color is, you ought to have clear -	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
- air and clear water in America.	0
That's what I believe.	0
Vice President Biden, I'd like to get you to respond.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Governor Inslee just said that your plan is middling.	0
There is no middle ground about my plan.	0
The fact of the matter is I call for the immediate action to be taken.	0
First of all, one of the things that - we're responsible for 15 percent of all the pollution in the country.	0
He's right about how it affects people and it affects neighborhoods, particularly poor neighborhoods	0
But here's the deal; in area, there's also another piece.	0
Eighty-five percent of it is something I helped negotiate; and that is the Paris Climate Accord.	0
I would immediately rejoin that Paris Accord.	0
I would make sure that we up the ante which it calls for.	0
I would be able to bring those leaders together who I know I - I convene (ph) them in the White House, like we did in nuclear summit, and I would raise the standard.	0
Thank you, Mr. Vice President	0
I also invested $400 billion -	0
Thank you, sir.	0
- in research for new alternatives to deal with climate change.	0
Mr. Yang, your response?	0
And that's bigger than any other person.	0
The important number in Vice President Biden's remarks just now is that he United States was only 15 percent of global emissions.	0
We like to act as if we're 100 percent, but the truth is even if we were to curb our emissions dramatically, the earth is still going to get warmer.	0
And we can see it around it us this summer.	0
The last four years have been the four warmest years in recorded history.	0
This is going to be a tough truth, but we are too late.	0
We are 10 years too late.	0
We need to do everything we can to start moving the climate in the right direction, but we also need to start moving our people to higher ground.	0
And the best way to do that is to put economic resources into your hands so you can protect yourself and your families.	0
I was challenged by the vice president.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
May I be heard on this for a moment?	0
Go ahead, Governor.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Look, we have -- these deadlines are set by science.	0
Mr. Vice President, your argument is not with me, it's with science.	0
And unfortunately, your plan is just too late.	0
The science tells us we have to get off coal in 10 years.	0
Your plan does not do that.	0
We have to have off of fossil fuels in our electrical grid in 15.	0
Your plan simply does not do that.	0
I've heard you say that we need a realistic plan.	0
Here's what I believe...	0
No, I didn't say that.	0
Here's what I believe.	0
I believe that survival is realistic, and that's the kind of plan we need.	0
And that's the kind I have.	0
My plan calls for 500,000 charging stations around the country so by 2030 we're all electric vehicles.	0
My plan calls for making sure that we have $400 billion invested in technologies to learn how to contain what we're doing, creating 10 million new jobs.	0
We will double offshore wind.	0
We will end any subsidies for coal or any other fossil fuel.	0
But we have to also engage the world while we're doing it.	0
We have to walk and chew gum at the same time.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.	0
Just to clarify, would there be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking, in a Biden administration?	0
No, we would -- we would work it out.	0
We would make sure it's eliminated and no more subsidies for either one of those, either -- any fossil fuel.	0
We can't...	0
Thank you, sir.	0
We cannot work it out.	0
We cannot work this out.	0
The time is up.	0
Our house is on fire.	0
We have to stop using coal in 10 years, and we need a president to do it or it won't get done.	0
Get off coal.	0
Save this country and the planet.	0
That's what I'm for.	0
Senator Harris, your response?	0
I mean, I have to agree with Governor Inslee.	0
And I'm going to just paraphrase one of your great sayings, Governor, which is we currently have a president in the White House who obviously does not understand the science.	0
He's been pushing science fiction instead of science fact.	0
The guy thinks that wind turbines cause cancer, but what in fact they cause is jobs.	0
And the reality is that I would take any Democrat on this stage over the current president of the United States, who is rolling it back to our collective peril.	0
We must have and adopt a Green New Deal.	0
On day one as president...	0
Thank you.	0
...	0
I would re-enter us in the Paris agreement.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
And put in place so we would be carbon neutral by 2030.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
I want to talk about that with Senator Gillibrand.	0
You're a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal, which includes the guarantee of a job with medical leave, paid vacations, and retirement security for everyone in America.	0
Explain how that's realistic.	0
So the first thing that I'm going to do when I'm president is I'm going to Clorox the Oval Office.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
The second thing I'm going to do is I will reengage on global climate change.	0
And I will not only sign the Paris global climate accords, but I will lead a worldwide conversation about the urgency of this crisis.	0
The greatest threat to humanity is global climate change.	0
I visited a family in Iowa who -- water spewed into her home, Fran Parr, it tossed her refrigerator upend, all the furniture was broken, all the dishes were broken, and mud was everywhere.	0
That is the impact of severe weather right now on families' lives.	0
And so the truth is, we need a robust solution.	0
When John F. Kennedy said I want to put a man on the moon in the next 10 years, not because it's easy, but because it's hard, he knew it was going to be a measure of our innovation, our success, our ability to galvanize worldwide competition.	0
He wanted to have a space race with Russia.	0
Why not have a green energy race with China?	0
Why not have clean air and clean water for all Americans?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Why not rebuild our infrastructure?	0
Why not actually invest in the green jobs?	0
That's what the Green New Deal is about.	0
Thank you.	0
Not only will I pass it, but I will put a price on carbon to make market forces help us.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Congresswoman Gabbard, you are not a cosponsor of the Green New Deal.	0
Please respond.	0
Well, first of all, this is personal.	0
If you can imagine, I grew up in Hawaii, which is the most remote island chain in the world.	0
So for us growing up there, protecting our environment was not a political issue, it's a way of life.	0
It's part of our culture.	0
It's part of who we are.	0
This is why, as a member of Congress, long before there was ever a Green New Deal, I introduced the most ambitious climate change legislation ever in Congress called the Off Fossil Fuels Act.	0
That actually laid out an actionable plan to take us from where we are today to transition off of fossil fuels and invest in green renewable energy, invest in workforce training, invest in the kinds of infrastructure that we need to deal with the problems and the challenges that climate is posing to us today.	0
Thank you, Congresswoman.	0
Senator Booker, what's your response?	0
Is the job guarantee in the Green New Deal realistic?	0
I just want to take, first of all, a step back and say that I agree wholeheartedly with Governor Inslee.	0
It's one of the reasons why Greenpeace ranks me and him at the top of this entire field of the candidates on climate.	0
Second, Cory.	0
Second, but close.	0
You're just close.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
I'm -- hey, hey.	0
I want to say very clearly -- thank you, man.	0
Thank you.	0
I'll try harder.	0
Look, the reason why is because, first of all, this problem didn't start yesterday.	0
Science didn't become a reality yesterday.	0
This has been going on for years.	0
There was another president that would not join an international accord.	0
Then it was the Kyoto accords.	0
I was mayor then.	0
And I stood up in national leadership joining with other mayors to say climate change is not a separate issue.	0
It must be the issue and the lens with which we view every issue.	0
Nobody should get applause for rejoining the Paris climate accords.	0
That is kindergarten.	0
We have to go to far advances and make sure that everything from our trade deals, everything from the billions of dollars we spend to foreign aid, everything must be sublimated to the challenge and the crisis that is existential, which is dealing with the climate threat.	0
And, yes, the majority of this problem is outside the United States, but the only way we're going to deal with this is if the United States leads.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Mayor de Blasio, your administration has come under fire after hundreds of children living in New York City public housing tested positive for elevated levels of lead.	0
As you know, we're not far from Flint, Michigan, where residents are still dealing with the consequences of having lead in their drinking water.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
How can you assure the people of Flint and across the nation that you are the right person to handle such a problem?	0
We have a huge problem, and it's decades old in New York.	0
But here's what we've done about it.	0
We've declared the eradication of all lead, literally ending the notion of lead poisoning once and all as the goal of our administration, and we're doing something about it.	0
Lead poisoning has gone down 90 percent since 2005, and we're going to literally bring it down to zero, because we're going to go into every place, buildings, schools, public housing, and take out that lead, remediate that lead once and for all, and that needs to be done all over this country.	0
Now, the federal government used to not take any responsibility for our public housing.	0
For decades they've been disinvesting in the public housing that was supposed to be a federal responsibility.	0
That's part of why we have this lead crisis to begin with.	0
But I'll tell you what you do when you're actually in charge of something.	0
I'm in charge of the largest city in this nation.	0
You do not accept the status quo.	0
You fix it.	0
And so we are going into every one of those apartments to make sure those children and those families are safe, and then we are going to eradicate that lead once and for all.	0
And there should be a federal mandate to do the same for Flint, for Detroit, for every place in this country.	0
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.	0
It can be done.	0
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.	0
Secretary Castro, why are you the right candidate to solve this problem?	0
Please respond.	0
Well, because people don't have to wonder what I would do; I've actually done it.	0
I was secretary of housing and urban development when Flint had its water crisis.	0
I went to Flint.	0
We did what we could to help folks get water filters.	0
And then we didn't stop there.	0
We improved the standard of how we deal with elevated blood lead levels in children.	0
A lot of Americans don't know that this is still a major problem out there.	0
I was back in Flint about six weeks ago, and I released a plan to invest $50 billion so that we remove lead as a major public health threat.	0
We need to do it.	0
We can do it.	0
And I will do it if I'm president.	0
Thank you, Secretary Castro.	0
May I get in on this?	0
Donald Trump won independents here in Michigan by 16 percentage points, which was critical to Donald Trump winning the state's 16 electoral votes.	0
Now there is a big debate within the Democratic Party here and around the country about the best way the Democrats can win back Michigan.	0
"Vice President Biden, last night on this stage, Senator Elizabeth Warren said, quote, ""We're not going to solve the urgent problems that we face with small ideas and spinelessness."	0
"We're going to solve them by being the Democratic Party of big, structural change."""	0
What do you say to progressives who worry that your proposals are not ambitious enough to energize the progressive wing of your party, which you will need to beat Donald Trump?	0
Because we did it.	0
I was asked to manage an $87 billion plan that would be spent in a total of 18 months that revived this state and many others, because -- and it kept us out of a depression, with 0.2% of waste or fraud.	0
Secondly, I was part of the organization -- and within our administration -- that pushed bailing General Motors out, saving tens of thousands of jobs here in this state.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Number three, number three, I also was asked, as the mayor of Detroit can tell you, by the president of the United States to help Detroit get out of bankruptcy and get back on its feet.	0
I spent better part of two years out here working to make sure that it did exactly that.	0
We invested significantly in this city when transportation, only -- anyway, the point is we've made significant investment in this state.	0
I expect in this city -- I suspect that's why the mayor endorsed me.	0
Thank you, Vice President Biden.	0
Senator Gillibrand, what's your response?	0
To the people of Michigan, I know exactly how I'd beat President Trump.	0
I've already done it.	0
I took a bus tour to talk about Trump's broken promises here in Michigan.	0
He promised no bad trade deals.	0
Not only did he not have bad trade deals, he started a trade war with China and he just signed on to another bad trade agreement with NAFTA 2.0, give away to drug companies in Mexico.	0
I took the bus to Michigan, to Ohio, and to Pennsylvania telling people that he has broken his promises to them.	0
I lifted up their voices, I listened to their concerns and I offered real solutions.	0
And I've done this before.	0
My first House district I ran in was a two to one republican district.	0
I won it twice and I haven't lost an election since.	0
Thank you.	0
And I haven't lost an election since.	0
So I can bring people together in red, purple, and blue areas.	0
But more than that, I can get things done.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Thank you, Senator Gillibrand.	0
Mr. Yang, in poll after poll democratic voters are saying that having a nominee who can beat President Trump is more important to them than having a nominee who agrees with them on major issues.	0
And right now, according to polls, they say the candidate who has the best chance of doing that, of beating President Trump is Vice President Biden.	0
Why are they wrong?	0
Well, I'm building a coalition of disaffected Trump voters, independents, libertarians, and conservatives, as well as democrats and progressives.	0
I believe I'm the candidate best suited to beat Donald Trump and as for how to win in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania, the problem is that so many people feel like the economy has left them behind.	0
What we have to do is we have to say look, there's record high GDP in stock market prices, you know what else they're at record high is?	0
Suicides, drug overdoses, depression, anxiety.	0
It's gotten so bad that American life expectancy had declined for the last three years.	0
And I like to talk about my wife who is at home with our two boys right now, one of whom is autistic.	0
What is her work count at in today's economy.	0
Zero and we know that's the opposite of the truth.	0
We know that her work is amongst the most challenging and vital.	0
The way we win this election as we redefine economic progress to include all the things that matter to the people in Michigan and all of us like our own heath, our well being, our mental health, our clean air and clean water, how are kids are doing.	0
If we change the measurements for the 21st century economy to revolve around our own well being then we will win this election.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Thank you, Mr. Yang.	0
Congresswoman Gabbard, your response?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Donald Trump won this election because far too many people in this country felt like they'd been left behind by both political parties, by self serving politicians on both sides who are more interested in partisan politics than they are in actually fighting for the people.	0
I'm speaking the truth to people all across this country about the fact that people in Flint, Michigan are still being left behind, still being poisoned by the water in their system because every single month we are spending $4 billion on a continuing war in Afghanistan, $4 billion every single month rather than ending that war, bringing our troops home, and using those precious resources into serving the needs of the people here in this country.	0
People, communities ...	0
Thank you, Congresswoman.	0
That's the kind of leadership that I'll bring.	0
Thank you, Congresswoman.	0
Senator Booker, your response.	0
I -- I'm grateful -- I'm grateful.	0
Jake look, this is one of those times where we're not staring at the truth and calling it out.	0
And -- and this is a case for the Democratic Party, the truth will set us free.	0
We lost the state of Michigan because everybody from republicans to Russians were targeting the suppression of African American voters.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We need to say that.	0
If the African American vote in this state had been like it was four years earlier, we would have won the state of Michigan.	0
We need to have a campaign that is ready for what's coming.	0
And all out of salt especially on the most valuable voter group in our -- in fact, the highest performing voter group in our coalition, which is black women.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And so I will be a person that tries to fight against voter suppression and to activate and engage the kind of voters and coalitions who are going to win states like Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.	0
Thank you.	0
Senator Harris?	0
First of all, Donald Trump came in making a whole lot of promises to working people that he did not keep.	0
He said he was going to help farmers.	0
He said he was going to help auto workers.	0
Farmers are now looking at bankruptcy, soy beans rotting in bills.	0
Auto workers we expect perhaps hundreds of thousands will be out of jobs by the end of the year.	0
Jerome Powell just dropped the interest rates and he admitted why.	0
Because of this so called trade policy that this president has that has been nothing more than the Trump trade tax that has resulted in American families spending as much as $1.4 billion more on everything from shampoo to washing machines.	0
He betrayed the American people, he betrayed American families, and he will lose this election because folks are clear ...	0
Thank you.	0
-- that he has done nothing except try to beat people down instead of lift people up.	0
And that's what we want in the next president of the United States.	0
Thank you, Senator Harris.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
The debate is back, right after this short break.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
We're back with the CNN Democratic presidential debate.	0
We want to turn now to the economy.	0
Secretary Castro, this is for you.	0
Wage growth is up.	0
Stocks are rising.	0
Unemployment is near historic lows, including for Latinos and African-Americans.	0
You have all outlined plans, but you in particular, that could end up raising taxes.	0
How can you guarantee that won't hurt the economy?	0
Well, first of all, there are a lot of Americans right now that are hurting.	0
Just go and ask the folks that just received notice that they're getting laid off by General Motors, or ask the many folks who are sleeping on the streets in big cities and small towns across the United States, or ask fast food workers that I joined a couple of weeks ago that are working for minimum wage and can't provide for their families or pay the rent.	0
So the idea that America is doing just fine is wrong.	0
Not only that, this president always likes to take credit, like he did this.	0
We have now had about 105 straight months of positive job growth, the longest streak in American history.	0
Over 80 months of that was due to President Barack Obama.	0
Thank you, Barack Obama.	0
Thank you, Barack Obama.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
So, you know, I believe that we need to invest in what will ensure that Americans can prosper in the years to come, making sure they have the knowledge and skills to compete in the 21st century economy, ensuring that they can afford the rent where they live and that they have health care so that they don't have to worry about going homeless because they can't afford a medical procedure.	0
Thank you, Secretary Castro.	0
I want to turn now to a question about trade and for Congresswoman Gabbard.	0
Many saw the Trans-Pacific Partnership issue as something that would be a critical tool to deal with the rise of China.	0
You were against it.	0
How would you ensure that the United States is able to remain competitive against China on the world stage?	0
By pushing for fair trade, not trade deals that give away the sovereignty of the American people and our country, that give away American jobs, and that threaten our environment.	0
These are the three main issues with that massive trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.	0
I think the central one was the fact that it gave away our sovereignty to a panel of international corporations whose rulings would supersede any domestic law that we would pass, either a federal law or a state or a local law.	0
This is extremely dangerous and goes against the very values that we have as a country.	0
What to speak of the fact that it would have a negative impact on domestic jobs and that it lacked clear protections for our environment.	0
These are the things that we have to keep at the forefront as we look to enact fair trade deals with other countries to make sure that we continue to be a thriving part of our global economy.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
So to be clear, Congresswoman, would you keep President Trump's tariffs on China in place?	0
I would not, because the approach that President Trump has taken has been extremely volatile without any clear strategic plan, and it has a ravaging and devastating effect on our domestic manufacturers, on our farmers, who are already struggling and now failing to see the light of day because of the plan that Trump has taken.	0
Vice President Biden, would you rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which, of course, President Trump withdrew from?	0
Please respond.	0
I'd renegotiate.	0
We make up 25 percent of the world's economy.	0
In order -- either China is going to write the rules of the road for the 21st century on trade or we are.	0
We have to join with the 40 percent of the world that we had with us, and this time make sure that there's no one sitting at that table doing the deal unless environmentalists are there and labor is there.	0
And to make sure we equip our workers first to compete by investing in them now, in the things that make them more competitive.	0
That's what we have to do.	0
Otherwise, they are going to write the rules of the road.	0
We must have the rest of the world join us to keep them in check from abusing.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
Vice President Biden, just to be clear, would you or would you not rejoin the TPP, yes or no?	0
I would not rejoin the TPP as it was initially put forward.	0
I would insist that we renegotiate pieces of that with the Pacific nations that we had in South America and North America, so that we could bring them together to hold China accountable for the rules of us setting the rules of the road as to how trade should be conducted.	0
Otherwise, they're going to do exactly what they're doing, fill the vacuum and run the -- and run the table.	0
Thank you, sir.	0
Mayor de Blasio, you also oppose the deal.	0
Please respond.	0
Yeah, and I just want to ask this question of all the candidates, but particularly of Vice President Biden.	0
President Trump is trying to sell NAFTA 2.0.	0
He's got a new name for it.	0
It's just as dangerous as the old NAFTA.	0
It's going to take away American jobs like the old NAFTA, like it did to Michigan.	0
And we cannot have Democrats be party to a new NAFTA.	0
So, Vice President, I believe you're the only person on the stage who voted for the original NAFTA.	0
Are you ready to say here and now that you will oppose a new NAFTA and that what you will believe in, which is a lot of us hope for, is trade treaties that empower organized labor across the boundaries of the world and give working people power again, not just multinational corporations.	0
Mr. Vice President?	0
Yes.	0
Your response?	0
Your response, sir?	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
Yes.	0
That's it?	0
No, he said, would I insist that labor be engaged?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
The answer is yes.	0
I consider that a victory.	0
Well, I love your affection for me.	0
You spend a lot of time with me.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
You know what?	0
We believe in redemption, Joe.	0
We believe in redemption in this party.	0
Well, I tell you what, I hope you're part of it.	0
OK, I'm going to ask a question of Senator Bennet now.	0
Senator, CNN reached out to Michigan Democratic primary voters for their most pressing question.	0
"Farris from Flint, Michigan, has this question: ""Here in Detroit, our economy has seen firsthand how technology and automation can displace workers and create uncertainty around human job security."	0
How would you balance these disruptions created by technology with the beneficial impact of technology on our economy?	0
Dana, this goes to the last question you asked, as well, which is, how are we going to remain competitive?	0
It's not just about trade, which we were talking about earlier.	0
It's about whether we're going to invest in this country anymore.	0
Since 2001, we have cut $5 trillion worth of taxes.	0
Almost all of that has gone to the wealthiest people in America.	0
We have made the income inequality worse, not better, through the policies of the federal government.	0
We've spent $5.6 trillion in the Middle East.	0
That's $12 trillion or $13 trillion that from the point of view of driving the economy in Michigan, or anywhere else in America, we might as well just have lit that money on fire.	0
We've got to stop doing that.	0
And we need to invest in America again.	0
For the money that we've spent that I just described, we could have fixed every road and bridge in this country.	0
We could have fixed every airport that needs to be fixed.	0
We could have fixed not just Flint, but every water system in this country.	0
Thank you.	0
We could have made Social Security solvent for my children.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
But we did none of it because of self-serving politicians in Washington, D.C., who voted for deals that were good for them but not for Michigan or the American people.	0
Senator Bennet, thank you very much.	0
Your time is up, sir.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you.	0
Mr. Yang, Mr. Yang, women on average earn 80 cents, about 80 cents for every dollar earned by men.	0
Senator Harris wants to fine companies that don't close their gender pay gaps.	0
As an entrepreneur, do you think a stiff fine will change how companies pay their female employees?	0
I have seen firsthand the inequities in the business world where women are concerned, particularly in start-ups and entrepreneurship.	0
We have to do more at every step.	0
And if you're a woman entrepreneur, the obstacles start not just at home, but then when you seek a mentor or an investor, often they don't look like you and they might not think your idea is the right one.	0
In order to give women a leg up, what we have to do is we have to think about women in every situation, including the ones who are in exploitive and abusive jobs and relationships around the country.	0
I'm talking about the waitress who's getting harassed by her boss at the diner who might have a business idea, but right now is stuck where she is.	0
What we have to do is we have to give women the economic freedom to be able to improve their own situations and start businesses, and the best way to do this is by putting a dividend of $1,000 a month into their hands.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
It would be a game-changer for women around the country, because we know that women do more of the unrecognized and uncompensated work in our society.	0
It will not change unless we change it.	0
And I say that's just what we do.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Harris, your response?	0
I think that's support of my proposal, which is this.	0
Since 1963, when we passed the Equal Pay Act, we have been talking about the fact women are not paid equally for equal work.	0
Fast forward to the year of our lord 2019, and women are paid 80 cents on the dollar, black women 61 cents, Native American woman 58 cents, Latinas 53 cents.	0
I'm done with the conversation.	0
So, yes, I am proposing in order to deal with this, one, I'm going to require corporations to post on their website whether they are paying women equally for equal work.	0
Two, they will be fined for every 1 percent differential between what they're paying men and women, they will be fined 1 percent of their previous year's profit.	0
That will get everybody's attention.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Time for action.	0
Senator Gillibrand, what's your response?	0
Will fining companies help solve the problem?	0
I think we have to have a broader conversation about whether we value women and whether we want to make sure women have every opportunity in the workplace.	0
And I want to address Vice President Biden directly.	0
When the Senate was debating middle-class affordability for childcare, he wrote an op-ed.	0
"He voted against it, the only vote, but what he wrote in an op-ed was that he believed that women working outside the home would, quote, ""create the deterioration of family."""	0
"He also said that women who were working outside the home were, quote, ""avoiding responsibility."""	0
And I just need to understand as a woman who's worked my entire career as the primary wage earner, as the primary caregiver, in fact, the second -- my second son, Henry, is here, and I had him when I was a member of Congress.	0
So under Vice President Biden's analysis, am I serving in Congress resulting in the deterioration of the family, because I had access to quality affordable day care?	0
I just want to know what he meant when he said that.	0
That was a long time ago, and here's what it was about.	0
It would have given people making today $100,000 a year a tax break for childcare.	0
I did not want that.	0
I wanted the childcare to go to people making less than $100,000.	0
And that's what it was about.	0
As a single father who in fact raised three children for five years by myself, I have some idea what it cost.	0
I support making sure that every single solitary person needing childcare get an $8,000 tax credit now.	0
That would put 700,000 women back to work, increase the GDP by almost 8/10 of 1 percent.	0
It's the right thing to do if we can give tax breaks to corporations for these things, why can't we do it this way?	0
But Mr. Vice President, you didn't answer my question.	0
What did you mean when you said when a woman works outside the home it's resulting in quote, the deterioration of family ...	0
No, what I ...	0
And that we are voiding -- these are quotes.	0
It was the title of the op-ed and that just causes concern for me because we know America's women are working.	0
4 out of 10 moms have to work.	0
They're the primary or sole wagers.	0
They actually have to put food on the table.	0
8 out of 10 moms are working today.	0
Most women have to work to provide for their kids.	0
Many women want to be working to provide for their communities and to help people.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Let the vice president respond now, thank you.	0
So either you don't believe it today or what did you mean when you said it then?	0
The very beginning my deceased wife worked when we had children.	0
My present wife has worked all the way through raising our children.	0
The fact of the matter is the situation is one that I don't know what's happened.	0
I wrote the Violence against Women Act.	0
Lilly Ledbetter.	0
I was deeply involved in making sure the equal pay amendments.	0
I was deeply involved on all these things.	0
I came up with the it's on us proposal to see to it that women were treated more decently on college campuses.	0
You came to Syracuse University with me and said it was wonderful.	0
I'm passionate about the concern making sure women are treated equally.	0
I don't know what's happened except that you're now running for president.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
So I understand -- Mr. Vice President -- Mr. Vice President, I respect you deeply.	0
I respect you deeply but those words are very specific.	0
You said women working outside the home would lead to the deterioration of family.	0
My grandmother worked outside the home.	0
My -- my mother worked outside the home.	0
And -- and ....	0
Thank you, Senator GILLIBRAND.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
I want to bring Senator Harris into this conversation.	0
Either he no longer believes it -- I mean I just think he needs to ...	0
I never believed it.	0
Thank you.	0
Senator Harris, please respond.	0
Well, I just -- listen, I mean talk about now running for president, you change your position on the Hyde Amendment, Vice President, where you mad a decision for years to withhold resources to poor women to have access to reproductive healthcare and including women who were the victims of rape and incest.	0
Do you now say that you have evolved and you regret that?	0
Because you have only, since you've been running for president this time, said that you had -- you in some way would take that back or you didn't agree with the decision that you made over many, many years.	0
And this directly impacted so many women in our country and I personally prosecuted rape cases and child molestation cases; and the experience that those women have, those children have and that they would then be denied the resources ...	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Let the Vice President ...	0
I think is -- is unacceptable.	0
The fact is that the senator knows that that's not position.	0
Everybody on this stage has been in the Congress and the Senate or House has voted for the Hyde Amendment at some point.	0
The Hyde Amendment in the past was available because there was other access for those kinds of services provided privately.	0
But once I wrote the legislation, making sure that every single woman would in fact be (ph) have an opportunity to have healthcare paid for by the federal government, everyone that -- that could no longer stand.	0
I support a woman's right to choose.	0
I support it's a constitutional right.	0
I've supported it and I will continue to support it and I will, in fact, move as president to see to it that the Congress legislates that that is the laws as well.	0
Thank you -- thank you, Mr. Vice President.	0
Governor Inslee, your response.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Well why did it take you so long to change your position in the Hyde Amendment.	0
Why did it take so long until you were running for president to change your position on the Hyde?	0
Because there was not full federal funding for all reproductive services prior to this point.	0
OK.	0
Thank you.	0
Governor Inslee, your response?	0
I -- I would suggest we need to broaden our discussion.	0
I would suggest we need to think about a bigger scandal in America, which is that in professions and careers where women have been more than the majority, they have been almost always under paid.	0
And that is why this year I'm proud to be the governor who won the largest pay increase for our educators in the United States.	0
And I believe that that is long, long overdue.	0
I think it is true for nursing staff as well.	0
And I'm glad that we've now passed in measures.	0
And I'm glad that we've increased our union membership 10 percent ...	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
So unions can stand up for women as well.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Thank you, Governor Inslee.	0
I want to turn to foreign policy, if we can.	0
Senator Booker, there are about 14,000 U.S. services members in Afghanistan right now.	0
If elected, will they still be in Afghanistan by the end of your first year in office?	0
Well, first of all, I want to say very clearly that I will not do foreign policy by tweet as Donald Trump seems to do all the time.	0
A guy that literally tweets out that we're pulling our troops out before his generals even know about it is creating a dangerous situation for our troops in places like Afghanistan.	0
And so I will bring our troops home and I will bring them home as quickly as possible, but I will not set during a campaign an artificial deadline.	0
I will make sure we do it, we do it expeditiously, we do it safely, to not create a vacuum that's ultimately going to destabilize the Middle East and perhaps create the environment for terrorism and for extremism to threaten our nation.	0
Congresswoman Gabbard, you're the only veteran on this stage.	0
Please respond.	0
This is real in a way that's very difficult to convey in words.	0
I was deployed to Iraq in 2005 during the height of the war where I served in a field medical unit where every single day I saw the high cost of war.	0
Just this past week, two more of our soldiers were killed in Afghanistan.	0
My cousin is deployed to Afghanistan right now.	0
Nearly 300 of our Hawaii National Guard soldiers are deployed to Afghanistan, 14,000 servicemembers are deployed there.	0
This is not about arbitrary deadlines.	0
This is about leadership, the leadership I will bring to do the right thing to bring our troops home, within the first year in office, because they shouldn't have been there this long.	0
For too long, we've had leaders who have been arbitrating foreign policy from ivory towers in Washington without any idea about the cost and the consequence, the toll that it takes on our servicemembers, on their families.	0
We have to do the right thing, end these wasteful regime change wars, and bring our troops home.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, Congresswoman.	0
Mr. Yang, Iran has now breached the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal after President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the deal, and that puts Iran closer to building a nuclear weapon, the ability to do so, at the very least.	0
"You've said if Iran violates the agreement, the U.S. would need to respond, quote, ""very strongly."""	0
So how would a President Yang respond right now?	0
I would move to de-escalate tensions in Iran, because they're responding to the fact that we pulled out of this agreement.	0
And it wasn't just us and Iran.	0
There were many other world powers that were part of that multinational agreement.	0
We'd have to try and reenter that agreement, renegotiate the timelines, because the timelines now don't make as much sense.	0
But I've signed a pledge to end the forever wars.	0
Right now, our strength abroad reflects our strength at home.	0
What's happened, really?	0
We've fallen apart at home, so we elected Donald Trump, and now we have this erratic and unpredictable relationship with even our longstanding partners and allies.	0
What we have to do is we have to start investing those resources to solve the problems right here at home.	0
We've spent trillions of dollars and lost thousands of American lives in conflicts that have had unclear benefits.	0
We've been in a constant state of war for 18 years.	0
This is not what the American people want.	0
I would bring the troops home, I would de-escalate tensions with Iran, and I would start investing our resources in our own communities.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Governor Inslee, your response?	0
Well, I think that these are matters of great and often difficult judgment.	0
And there is no sort of primer for presidents to read.	0
We have to determine whether a potential president has adequate judgment in these decisions.	0
I was only one of two members on this panel today who were called to make a judgment about the Iraq war.	0
I was a relatively new member of Congress, and I made the right judgment, because it was obvious to me that George Bush was fanning the flames of war.	0
Now we face similar situations where we recognize we have a president who would be willing to beat the drums of war.	0
We need a president who can stand up against the drums of war and make rational decisions.	0
That was the right vote, and I believe it.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
Vice President Biden, he was obviously suggesting that you made the wrong decision and had bad judgment when you voted to go to war in Iraq as a U.S. senator.	0
I did make a bad judgment, trusting the president saying he was only doing this to get inspectors in and get the U.N. to agree to put inspectors in.	0
"From the moment ""shock and awe"" started, from that moment, I was opposed to the effort, and I was outspoken as much as anyone at all in the Congress and the administration."	0
Secondly, I was asked by the president in the first meeting we had on Iraq, he turned and said, Joe, get our combat troops out, in front of the entire national security team.	0
One of the proudest moment of my life was to stand there in Al-Faw Palace and tell everyone that we're coming -- all our combat troops are coming home.	0
Thank you.	0
I opposed the surge in Afghanistan, this long overdue -- we should have not, in fact, gone into Afghanistan the way...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.	0
I want to bring in...	0
Mr. Vice President -- I'd like to comment.	0
I would like to bring in the person on the stage who served in Iraq, Governor -- I'm sorry, Congresswoman Gabbard.	0
Your response to what Vice President Biden just said.	0
We were all lied to.	0
This is the betrayal.	0
This is the betrayal to the American people, to me, to my fellow servicemembers.	0
We were all lied to, told that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, was working with Al Qaida, and that this posed a threat to the American people.	0
So I enlisted after 9/11 to protect our country, to go after those who attacked us on that fateful day, who took the lives of thousands of Americans.	0
The problem is that this current president is continuing to betray us.	0
We were supposed to be going after Al Qaida.	0
But over years now, not only have we not gone after Al Qaida, who is stronger today than they were in 9/11, our president is supporting Al Qaida.	0
Thank you, Congresswoman.	0
We didn't talk about Iran.	0
Let's talk about -- thank you, please.	0
We didn't talk about Iran.	0
Please.	0
We're on the march to war in Iran right now, and we blew by it.	0
Please, Mayor.	0
The rules -- please follow the rules.	0
I respect the rules, but we have to stop this march to war in Iran.	0
Mayor, thank you very much.	0
We're going on...	0
And the Democratic Party has to stand up for it.	0
... and we're going to talk about another subject.	0
Mayor, thank you very much.	0
I appreciate that.	0
Let's talk about now the former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's appearance in front of Congress last week.	0
When asked whether or not the president could be charged with a crime after leaving office, his answer was yes.	0
"Senator Harris, you have criticized President Trump for interfering with the Justice Department, and just last month you said if you were elected president, your Justice Department would, quote, ""have no choice and should go forward with obstruction of justice charges against former President Trump."""	0
Why is it OK for you to advocate for the Justice Department to prosecute somebody, but President Trump, not him?	0
Well, I would never direct the Department of Justice to do whatever it believes it should do.	0
But, listen, look, we all watched his testimony.	0
I've read the report.	0
There are 10 clear incidents of obstruction of justice by this president, and he needs to be held accountable.	0
I have seen people go to prison for far less.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And the reality of it is that we have a person in the White House right now who has been shielded by a memo in the United States Department of Justice that says a sitting president cannot be indicted.	0
I believe the American people are right to say there should be consequence and accountability for everyone and no one is above the law, including the president of the United States.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Booker, your response?	0
My response is exactly that.	0
I've read the report.	0
I've read the redacted versions of the report.	0
We have something that is astonishing going on in the United States of the America.	0
We have a president that is not acting like the leader of the free world.	0
He's acting like an authoritarian against the actual Constitution that he swore an oath to uphold.	0
And so this is a difference with a lot of us on this debate stage.	0
I believe that we in the United States Congress should start impeachment proceedings immediately.	0
And I'll tell you this...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Debbie Stabenow now has joined my call for starting impeachment proceedings, because he is now stonewalling Congress, not allowing -- subjecting himself to the checks and balances.	0
We swore an oath to uphold the Constitution.	0
The politics of this be dammed.	0
When we look back in history at what happened when a president of the United States started acting more like an authoritarian leader than the leader of the free world, the question is, is what will we have done?	0
And I believe the Congress should do its job.	0
Senator Booker, thank you very much.	0
Secretary Castro, what's your response?	0
Well, I agree.	0
I was the first of the candidates to call on Congress to begin impeachment proceedings.	0
There are 10 different incidents that Robert Mueller has pointed out where this president either obstructed justice or attempted to obstruct justice.	0
And I believe that they should go forward with impeachment proceedings.	0
As to the question of what my Department of Justice would do, I agree with those who say that a president should not direct an attorney general specifically to prosecute or not prosecute.	0
However, I believe that the evidence is plain and clear and that if it gets that far, that you're likely to see a prosecution of Donald Trump.	0
Thank you, Secretary.	0
Mayor de Blasio, I'm going to bring you in.	0
What's your response?	0
I think it's obvious at this point in our history that the president has committed the crimes worthy of impeachment.	0
But I want to caution my fellow Democrats.	0
While we move in every way we can for impeachment, we have to remember at the same time the American people are out there looking for us to do something for them in their lives.	0
And what they see when they turn on the TV or go online is just talk about impeachment.	0
We need more talk about working people and their lives.	0
For example, are we really ready -- and I ask people on this stage this question -- are we ready to make sure that the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes?	0
That's something every American wants to know about.	0
That's something they want answers to right now.	0
So, yeah, move for impeachment, but don't forget to do the people's business and to stand up for working people, because that's how we're actually going to beat Donald Trump.	0
The best impeachment is beating him in the election of 2020.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Mayor, thank you very much.	0
Senator Bennet, how do you respond to this conversation?	0
I think, look, as we go forward here, we need to recognize a very practical reality, which is that we are four months -- we've got the August recess.	0
Then we are four months away from the Iowa Caucuses.	0
And I just want to make sure whatever we do doesn't end up with an acquittal by Mitch McConnell in the Senate, which it surely would.	0
And then President Trump would be running saying that he had been acquitted by the United States Congress.	0
I believe we have a moral obligation to beat Donald Trump.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
He has to be a single-term president.	0
And we can't do anything that plays into our -- his hands.	0
We were talking earlier about -- about climate up here.	0
It's so important.	0
Donald Trump should be the last climate denier that's ever in the White House.	0
Senator Bennet, thank you very much.	0
Secretary Castro, please respond.	0
But we need to be smart about how we're running or we're going to give him a second term.	0
We can't do it.	0
Secretary, please, your turn.	0
Well, let me first say that I really do believe that we can walk and chew gum at the same time.	0
All of us have a vision for the future of the country that we're articulating to the American people.	0
We're going to continue to do that.	0
We have an election coming up.	0
At the same time, Senator, you know, I think that too many folks in the Senate and in the Congress have been spooked by 1998.	0
I believe that the times are different.	0
And in fact, I think that folks are making a mistake by not pursuing impeachment.	0
The Mueller Report clearly details that he deserves it.	0
"And what's going to happen in the fall of next year, of 2020, if they don't impeach him, is he's going to say, ""You see?"	0
You see?	0
The Democrats didn't go after me on impeachment, and you know why?	0
"Because I didn't do anything wrong."""	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
These folks that always investigate me, they're always trying to go after me.	0
"When it came down to it, they didn't go after me there because I didn't do anything wrong."""	0
Conversely, if Mitch McConnell is the one that lets him off the hook, we're going to be able to say...	0
Secretary...	0
Well, sure, they impeached him in the House, but his friend, Mitch McConnell, Moscow Mitch, let him off the hook.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Bennet, please respond.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I -- I don't disagree with that.	0
You just said it better than I did.	0
We have to walk and chew gum at the same time.	0
It is incredibly unusual for members of Congress to be able to do that.	0
And I'm glad that Secretary Castro has the ambition...	0
Well, my brother can.	0
He's here tonight.	0
Ah, that's what I was going to say.	0
It's your brother that's given you that good feeling about the Congress.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
That's what we should do.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Thank you, gentlemen.	0
The debate continues, right after this.	0
Welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate.	0
It is time now for closing statements.	0
You will each receive one minute.	0
Mayor de Blasio, let's begin with you.	0
Thank you.	0
For the last three years, we've watched Donald Trump pit working people against each other, black versus white, citizen versus immigrant.	0
And why?	0
So that the wealthy and the powerful he represents can hold the American dream hostage from everyone else.	0
We can't let them get away with it.	0
If we're going to beat Donald Trump, this has to be a party that stands for something.	0
This has to be the party of labor unions.	0
This has to be the party of universal healthcare.	0
This has to be the party that's not afraid to say out loud we're going to tax the hell out of the wealthy.	0
And when we do that, Donald Trump right on cue will call us socialists.	0
Well, here's what I'll say to him.	0
Donald, you're the real socialist.	0
The problem is, it's socialism for the rich.	0
We, here in this country, we don't have to take that anymore.	0
We can fight back.	0
If you agree that we can stand up to Donald Trump and we can stand up to the wealthy, then go to taxthehell.com and join us, so we can build a country that puts working people first.	0
Senator Bennet?	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you very much.	0
What I want to say to all of you tonight is, we have been here before as a country.	0
We have faced challenges that we've -- we actually even forget some of us tonight how hard the people fought, how hard they worked, how hard they organized, the votes they had to take, the people they had to get to the polls to make this country more democratic, more fair, and more free.	0
And now we have a person in the White House who has no appreciation of that history, who doesn't believe in the rule of law, who doesn't believe in the independence of the judiciary, who doesn't believe that climate change is real.	0
I think that we have an incredible opportunity in front of us, all of us, to come together just as our parents and grandparents did before them, and face challenges even harder than the ones that we face, but the only way we're going to be able to do it is to put the divisive politics of Donald Trump behind us and the divisive politics of the last 10 years behind us.	0
We need to come together united against a broken Washington, make Donald Trump a one-term president, and begin to govern this country again for our kids and our grandkids who cannot do it for themselves.	0
We have to do it for them.	0
Please join me at michaelbennet.com.	0
Thanks for being here tonight.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Governor Inslee?	0
For decades, we have kicked the can down the road on climate change.	0
And now under Donald Trump, we face a looming catastrophe.	0
But it is not too late.	0
We have one last chance.	0
And when you have one chance in life, you take it.	0
Literally the survival of humanity on this planet and civilization as we know it is in the hands of the next president.	0
And we have to have a leader who will do what is necessary to save us.	0
And that includes making this the top priority of the next presidency.	0
And I alone on this panel am making a commitment that this will be the organizing principle of my administration not the first day, but every day.	0
And if you share my view of the urgency of this matter, I hope you'll join me, because we are up against powerful special fossil fuel interests.	0
And it is time to stand up on our legs and confront the fossil fuel special interests.	0
Because that is our salvation, what it depends upon.	0
I am confident and optimistic tonight, even in the face of this difficulty, because I know we can build a clean energy economy, I know we can save our children and our grandchildren.	0
I know that we can defeat climate change and we will defeat Donald Trump.	0
This is our moral responsibility.	0
And we will fulfill it.	0
Thank you very much.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Gillibrand?	0
Donald trump has really torn apart the moral fabric of this country, dividing us on every racial line, every religious line, every socioeconomic line he can find.	0
I'm running for president because I want to help people, and I actually have the experience and the ability to do that.	0
I've brought Congress together and actually made a difference in people's lives.	0
I also know how to beat Donald Trump.	0
He has broken his promises to the American people.	0
I've taken this fight directly to his backyard in Michigan and Ohio and in Pennsylvania, and I'll go to all the places in this country.	0
I will fight for your family.	0
It doesn't matter who you are, it doesn't matter where you live, it doesn't matter who you love.	0
Because that's my responsibility.	0
And I've done this before.	0
I started out in a 2-to-1 Republican district.	0
I won it twice.	0
I've never lost an election since.	0
And I not only bring people together electorally, but also legislatively.	0
I get things done.	0
So we need a president who's not afraid of the big challenges, of the big fights.	0
There is no false choice.	0
We don't need a liberal or progressive with big ideas or we don't need a moderate who can win back Trump-Obama voters.	0
You need someone who can do both.	0
And that's who I am.	0
Please go to kirstengillibrand.com so I can make the next debate stage.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Congresswoman Gabbard?	0
Thank you.	0
Now, Donald Trump and warmongering politicians in Washington have failed us.	0
They continue to escalate tensions with other nuclear-armed countries like Russia and China and North Korea, starting a new Cold War, pushing us closer and closer to the brink of nuclear catastrophe.	0
Now, as we stand here tonight, there are thousands of nuclear missiles pointed at us.	0
And if we were to get an attack right here tonight, we would have 30 minutes, 30 minutes before we were hit.	0
"And you would receive an alert like the one we received in Hawaii last year that would say, ""Incoming missile."	0
Seek immediate shelter.	0
This is not a drill.	0
Seek immediate shelter.	0
"This is not a drill."""	0
And you would see as we did, as my loved ones in Hawaii did, there is no shelter.	0
This is the warmonger's hoax.	0
There is no shelter.	0
It's all a lie.	0
As president, I will end this insanity, because it doesn't have to be this way.	0
I will end these wasteful regime change wars, work to end this new Cold War through the use of diplomacy to de-escalate these tensions and take the trillions of dollars that we've been wasting on these wars and on these weapons and redirect those resources into serving the needs of our people right here at home, things like health care for all, making sure everyone in this country has clean water to drink and clean air to breathe, investing in education, investing in our infrastructure.	0
The needs are great.	0
As your president, I will put your interests above all else.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Secretary Castro?	0
Well, first of all, let me say thank you to you, Jake, Dana, and to Don, and to everybody here and to those watching.	0
You know, this election is all about what kind of nation we're going to become.	0
You and I, we stand on the shoulders of folks who have made beds and made sacrifices, people that fought in wars and fought discrimination, folks that picked crops and stood in picket lines, and they helped build the wonderful nation that we live in today.	0
Donald Trump has not been bashful in his cruelty.	0
And I'm not going to be bashful in my common sense and compassion.	0
I believe that we need leadership that understands that we need to move forward as one nation, with one destiny.	0
Our destiny in the years to come is to be the smartest, the healthiest, the fairest and the most prosperous nation on Earth.	0
If you want to help me build that America for the future, I hope you'll go to juliancastro.com.	0
"And on January 20th, 2021, we'll say together, ""Adios to Donald Trump."""	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Mr. Yang?	0
You know what the talking heads couldn't stop talking about after the last debate?	0
It's not the fact that I'm somehow number four on the stage in national polling.	0
It was the fact that I wasn't wearing a tie.	0
Instead of talking about automation and our future, including the fact that we automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs, hundreds of thousands right here in Michigan, we're up here with makeup on our faces and our rehearsed attack lines, playing roles in this reality TV show.	0
It's one reason why we elected a reality TV star as our president.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We need to be laser-focused on solving the real challenges of today, like the fact that the most common jobs in America may not exist in a decade, or that most Americans cannot pay their bills.	0
My flagship proposal, the freedom dividend, would put $1,000 a month into the hands of every American adult.	0
It would be a game-changer for millions of American families.	0
If you care more about your family and your kids than my neckwear, enter your zip code at yang2020.com and see what $1,000 a month would mean to your community.	0
I have done the math.	0
It's not left; it's not right.	0
It's forward.	0
And that is how we're going to beat Donald Trump in 2020.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Booker?	0
Thank you.	0
First, I just want to give a lot of thanks to the city of Detroit.	0
They're hosting us today, and one of the reasons I respect this city is because it has the kind of defiant love that I find in many American cities, including the city of Newark.	0
And Detroit is turning around and Newark is turning around because we let no one divide us, no one demean or degrade us or underestimate or worth.	0
We pulled together and fought for common purpose and common cause.	0
That's the history of this city.	0
My mom is sitting there who was born in the city of Detroit, born to a guy...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... that was a UAW worker, my grandfather, who pulled his family out of poverty in the Depression.	0
My grandmother joined him.	0
She was really entrepreneurial, opened a pool hall and a laundromat right here in this city.	0
That is the American dream.	0
And so many of us have stories like that.	0
But the dream of this country is under threat right now.	0
While, my mom's generation, 80 -- 95% of baby boomers did better than their parents.	0
It's now just a coin toss for millennials.	0
We have a real crisis in our country, and the crisis is Donald Trump, but not only Donald Trump.	0
I have a frustration that sometimes people are saying the only thing they want is to beat Donald Trump.	0
Well, that is the floor and not the ceiling.	0
The way we beat Donald Trump is not just focusing on him.	0
He wants to take all the oxygen out of the room.	0
It's when we start focusing on each other and understanding that our common bonds and our common purpose to address our common pain is what has saved us before.	0
It's what's going to save us now.	0
"That is the kind of leader that I am going to be as president of the United States, not just uniting the Democratic Party but making sure that we put more ""indivisible"" back into this one nation under God."	0
And if you believe like I do, please go to corybooker.com and join the mission.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Harris?	0
So in my background as attorney general of California, I took on the big banks who preyed on the homeowners, many of whom lost their homes and will never be able to buy another.	0
I've taken on the for-profit colleges who preyed on students, put them out of business.	0
I've preyed on transnational criminal organizations that have preyed on women and children.	0
And I will tell you, we have a predator living in the White House.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And I'm going to tell you something.	0
Donald Trump has predatory nature and predatory instincts.	0
And the thing about predators is this.	0
By their very nature, they prey on people they perceive to be weak.	0
They prey on people they perceive to be vulnerable.	0
They prey on people who are in need of help, often desperate for help.	0
And predators are cowards.	0
What we need is someone who is going to be on that debate stage with Donald Trump and defeat him by being able to prosecute the case against four more years.	0
And let me tell you, we've got a long rap sheet.	0
We're looking at someone who passed a tax bill benefiting the top 1 percent and the biggest corporations in this country when he said he would help working families.	0
We've got a person who has put babies in cages and separated children from their parents.	0
We have someone who passed a so-called trade policy that was trade policy by tweet and has resulted in a tax on American families.	0
So we must defeat him and then, in turning the page, write the next chapter for our country.	0
And that has to be written in a way that recognizes what wakes people up at 3:00 in the morning.	0
And that is my agenda, the 3:00 a.m. agenda that is focused on giving folks the jobs they need, getting their children the education they need, making sure they have the health care they need and the future they deserve.	0
So please join me at kamalaharris.org.	0
And I thank you for your time.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Vice President Biden?	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you very much.	0
And thank you, Mr. Mayor, for Detroit hosting this.	0
Look, I've said it many times, and I think everyone agrees with this.	0
We're in a battle for the soul of America.	0
This is the most consequential election anyone of you, no matter how old or young you are, has ever, ever participated in.	0
Four more years of Donald Trump will go down as an aberration -- hard to overcome the damage he's done, but we can overcome it.	0
Eight more years of Donald Trump will change America in a fundamental way.	0
The America we know will no longer exist.	0
Everybody knows who Donald Trump is.	0
We have to let him know who we are.	0
We choose science over fiction.	0
We choose hope over fear.	0
We choose unity over division.	0
And we choose -- we choose the idea that we can as Americans, when we act together, do anything.	0
This is the United States of America.	0
When we've acted together, we have never, never, never been unable to overcome whatever the problem was.	0
If you agree with me, go to joe30330 and help me in this fight.	0
Thank you very much.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Candidates, thank you so much.	0
We appreciate it.	0
And stay with CNN for special coverage of tonight's debate.	0
Anderson Cooper and Chris Cuomo are coming up.	0
That begins right now.	0
Wow.	0
Oh, hello, Fargo.	0
Hi, Fargo.	0
We love you, Fargo.	0
What a place.	0
What a place.	0
Thank you very much.	0
This is an honor.	0
You know, I wish we could have had this stage back about 100 yards.	0
You'd see how many people.	0
This place is packed.	0
This place is packed.	0
The only thing more packed is outside, trying to get in.	0
They're having a hard time.	0
They can't get in.	0
It's full.	0
You know, we had the chance for a 24,000-seat arena.	0
And we should have taken it.	0
"The problem is, if we had two empty seats, we didn't quite get there, which will always happen, they will say, ""He didn't fill up the arena."	0
"He didn't fill it up."""	0
Right.	0
That's what they'll say.	0
He didn't fill that arena up.	0
Twenty-four thousand seats.	0
No, we would have filled it up very easily, in retrospect, but that's OK.	0
Thank you very much.	0
I am thrilled to be here in the great state of North Dakota with so many hard-working American patriots.	0
Right?	0
And I want to congratulate -- right?	0
We want to do this.	0
You know what I'm going to say.	0
I want to congratulate the North Dakota State Bison.	0
I shouldn't tell you this.	0
I shouldn't tell you this, but when I was coming out, they were talking about Bison.	0
"I said, ""I thought there was an s."" They said, ""It is."	0
"But it's pronounced Bizon."""	0
So, we didn't want to get that wrong, right?	0
But that is some -- that is some great national championship team.	0
That's a great group of winners.	0
Winners.	0
We're honored to be joined by many of your wonderful North Dakota leaders.	0
Your governor, and a great guy, Doug Burgum, and his wife, First Lady of North Dakota, Kathryn Burgum.	0
Where are you, Governor?	0
Where are you?	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
Your former governor, Ed Schafer.	0
Ed.	0
Nice guy.	0
A friend of mine, who employs a lot of people, a very successful guy.	0
He puts a straw in the ground and oil comes out.	0
These big companies, they go out, they spend billions looking for oil.	0
They don't find anything.	0
Harold Hamm.	0
Where's Harold?	0
Where is Harold?	0
If I ever want to find oil, I'm going to call Harold.	0
Here's a straw, Harold.	0
North Dakota Republican Party Chairman, great guy, really helpful, Rick Berg.	0
Thank you, Rick.	0
A man who is so incredibly helpful, to me and to you, and to everybody.	0
A special person who works so hard.	0
I call him all-action, no-talk, that's -- don't we like that?	0
All-action...	0
Senator John Hoeven.	0
He is fantastic.	0
And I also want to thank Kelly Armstrong, who's running for Congress.	0
He's going to win.	0
And Kelly, thank you very much.	0
Thank you.	0
Good guy.	0
We also have a couple of big supporters.	0
Do you ever see this guy with the pillows on Fox?	0
John?	0
MyPillow guy.	0
Mike Liddell.	0
Where is Mike?	0
He is the greatest.	0
I have never seen so many ads for so long.	0
And you know what?	0
I think he gets them for, like, peanuts.	0
First of all, he does make a great product.	0
Great pillows.	0
I actually use them, believe it or not.	0
But he's been -- he's been a supporter from day one.	0
"And I said, ""You know, I want you to be my ad buyer."""	0
Because I guarantee you, he makes great deals.	0
So, I haven't asked him yet.	0
Will you be my ad buyer, please, Mike?	0
The MyPillow guy.	0
Thank you.	0
And he's been with us right from the beginning.	0
Along with a lot of other folks, actually.	0
We've had a great journey together, and we are making progress like nobody thought possible.	0
Finally, the person we are all here tonight to support, a special person, an incredible person, the next United States Senator from the great state of North Dakota, Kevin Cramer.	0
Kevin, come out.	0
Good guy.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, Mr. President.	0
All I can say is, Mr. President, on behalf of all of the thousands of people in this arena, and the tens of thousands outside of this arena, who live in flyover country, thank you for not forgetting us.	0
And for all the farmers, and the manufacturers, and the families, and the energy workers, thank you for rolling back all of those regulations so they can not only keep their jobs but create more jobs.	0
And, Mr. President, on behalf of the middle-class working families represented in this room and throughout the heartland, thank you for cutting their taxes, so they can keep more of their hard-earned money right here.	0
And, Mr. President, on behalf of the most vulnerable forgotten people, the unborn babies, thank you for standing for life.	0
Thank you.	0
And on these very important North Dakota values, you'll never have to wonder where I'll be, because I'll always be with them and with you, 100 percent of the time.	0
Thank you.	0
God bless you.	0
Welcome to North Dakota.	0
USA!	0
USA!	0
USA!	0
I have got to tell you, that's pretty good.	0
That's pretty good.	0
He did good.	0
He loves you.	0
I will tell you that.	0
He loves this state, loves the people.	0
And we need Kevin Cramer to replace liberal Democrat Heidi Heitkamp in the Senate.	0
Going to happen.	0
It's going to happen.	0
When Heidi ran for office, she promised to be an independent vote for the people of North Dakota.	0
Instead, she went to Washington and immediately joined Chuck.	0
You know who Chuck is.	0
And Nancy.	0
And now they have a new leader.	0
Who's the new leader?	0
[Inaudible]	0
Maxine Waters is their new leader.	0
[Booing]	0
Maxine Waters.	0
I think she's taking over.	0
You know, they say, took.	0
I never believed I was taking over the Republican Party.	0
They say that to cause problems.	0
But Maxine Waters is taking over the Democrat Party, so.	0
Heidi voted no on the Obamacare repeal.	0
And, by the way, it was done.	0
It was done.	0
Unfortunately, she wouldn't vote.	0
And another person didn't vote.	0
We had it done.	0
Another person campaigned for eight years.	0
Repeal and replace.	0
And we were a little surprised when the thumb went down.	0
But we're doing very well.	0
You see what's happening.	0
We're coming up with incredible plans.	0
We've gotten rid of the individual mandate, which is terrible.	0
It's been gutted.	0
But remember this.	0
Individual mandate, where you have the privilege of paying a lot of money for the second privilege of not having to pay for not getting health care.	0
What kind of a deal is that?	0
So, you pay in order to not to have to pay, because you don't want the health care because it was no good anyway.	0
So, we have, though our Secretary of Labor, Alex Acosta, we just came out with the association plan, which is phenomenal.	0
Millions and millions of people are signing up.	0
And we're coming out with another plan with Alex Azar.	0
We are coming out with that plan in two weeks.	0
We are coming out with so many health care plans.	0
It is so much better than anything you've ever seen before.	0
Competitive.	0
And Obamacare is essentially dead.	0
I would have been happier with a nice yes vote instead of a no vote, but that's OK. We're doing great.	0
And probably we wouldn't have come up with these two other plans.	0
And it's actually three, now, other plans if we didn't.	0
You know, sometimes you work under pressure, and you do better, right?	0
I think most of the people in this room, under pressure, you end up doing better.	0
There are those people.	0
We want to know those people.	0
Heidi voted no on our massive tax cuts for North Dakota families.	0
"She voted ""no."""	0
[Booing]	0
Not one Democrat voted to cut your taxes.	0
And the other day Nancy Pelosi said we have to raise your taxes.	0
What's that all about?	0
She wants to raise your taxes.	0
Heidi voted no on legislation to stop late term abortions.	0
[Booing]	0
Heidi voted in favor of the deadly, very, very dangerous, horrible sanctuary cities.	0
[Booing]	0
You need a senator who doesn't just talk like they're from North Dakota but votes like they're from North Dakota.	0
That's what you need.	0
And that is Kevin Cramer.	0
So, a vote for any Democrat is November is a vote for Schumer, Pelosi, and Maxine.	0
[Booing]	0
Maxine.	0
She's a beauty.	0
[Laughter]	0
I mean, she practically was telling people the other day to assault.	0
Can you imagine if I said the things she said?	0
We demand that he immediately drop out of the race.	0
Can you imagine, seriously, if I said that, or somebody else said that?	0
Horrible, what she said.	0
Now they want to censure her.	0
Let's see where that goes, folks.	0
[Laughter]	0
Her own party was talking about censure.	0
Let's see where that goes.	0
Heidi was also against us from the very beginning of the travel ban, a common-sense policy to improve our vetting and our national security.	0
And I'm proud to report that, just yesterday, the Supreme Court upheld the travel ban...... and our authority to keep America safe.	0
USA!	0
USA!	0
USA!	0
And, by the way -- by the way, a lot of media back here.	0
[Booing]	0
If crooked Hillary would have won this election, and if she came here, which is about a zero percent change, after the election,... she'd have 200 people in a conference room in a small hotel.	0
[Laughter]	0
You know, the saddest thing, we, I, we're making them rich.	0
They never had ratings like this.	0
You know, when the NFL is down 20 percent, it's the flag.	0
But it's also the fact that everybody is watching us on the different cable networks.	0
Because, frankly, they find this more exciting than the NFL, and a hell of a lot more dangerous, right?	0
And is there any better place to be on a nice, beautiful evening in North Dakota than at a Trump rally, right?	0
We're having a good time.	0
And I wish those cameras would circle the room to see how many thousands of people are here, because, you know, on the screen I look -- and all you see are those few beautiful, wonderful people -- I don't know who the hell I -- but you've got a nice group over there.	0
I know you have Mike and some others.	0
They're going to be so famous.	0
But you see, like, that little group.	0
That's all you see on camera.	0
Would you please circle the room for the few honest...	0
Please circle.	0
Trump!	0
Trump!	0
Trump!	0
USA!	0
USA!	0
USA!	0
"No, I just looked at the screen, and I said to my people, ""How many people are here?"""	0
"They said, ""Six thousand in the arena, but we're going to be -- have to, unfortunately, walk 15,000 or 18,000 people that couldn't get in."""	0
"I said, ""You've got to be kidding, because on the screen it looks like there's exactly 30 people."	0
What the hell is this?	0
[Laughter]	0
The late, great, Cecil B. DeMille would not have set it up this way, I will tell you.	0
The travel ban ruling underscores just how critical it is to confirm judges who will support our Constitution, our great, great Constitution.	0
Justice Anthony Kennedy, a very special guy, also just announced a little while ago his retirement from the United States Supreme Court.	0
Great man.	0
And I'm very honored that he chose to do it during my term in office, because he felt confident in me to make the right choice and carry on his great legacy.	0
That's why he did it.	0
And I'd like to take a moment to show our great appreciation for Justice Kennedy's lifetime of distinguished service.	0
Terrific man.	0
Service to our nation, and to the cause of liberty.	0
We were thrilled to appoint one of Kennedy's former clerks to the Supreme Court.	0
Did you ever hear of Justice Neil Gorsuch?	0
He's doing great.	0
He's a star.	0
And Justice Kennedy is a star.	0
And we appreciate it.	0
We really have to take our hats off to Justice Kennedy.	0
Thank you very much.	0
And remember this.	0
So, we have a pick to come up.	0
We have to pick a great one.	0
We have to pick one that's going to be there for 40 years, 45 years.	0
Yeah.	0
We need intellect.	0
We need so many things to go.	0
You know, there's so many elements go into the making of a great Justice of the Supreme Court.	0
You've got to hit every one of them.	0
Heidi will vote no to any pick we make for the Supreme Court.	0
She will be told to do so.	0
Now, maybe, because of this, she'll be forced to vote yes.	0
Who knows?	0
But I will tell you she'll vote no the day after the election on everything.	0
Justice Kennedy's retirement makes the issue of Senate control one of the vital issues of our time.	0
The most important thing we can do. Democrats want judges who will rewrite the Constitution any way they want to do it, and take away your Second Amendment, erase your borders...	0
[Booing]	0
... throw open the jailhouse doors and destroy your freedoms.	0
[Booing]	0
We must elect more Republicans.	0
We have to do that.	0
And the problem is, in the Senate, we have 51.	0
We don't have enough.	0
We lose one.	0
If somebody gets a bad cold, let's assume they come in for a cold, but let's assume it's worse than that.	0
It's a very tough situation.	0
We need more Republicans, especially in the Senate.	0
We have to hold the House, and maybe even increase it.	0
And I think we'll be able to do it.	0
They keep talking about this blue wave.	0
Their blue wave is really sputtering pretty badly.	0
The red wave is happening.	0
Just look what happened last night.	0
Famous people.	0
Oh, they're going to be so famous tomorrow.	0
You were in that little group of people behind the president.	0
Yeah.	0
They're going to be famous people, those people.	0
You have a better location, but they're going to be famous.	0
Republicans want strong borders and no crime.	0
Very simple.	0
Not complex.	0
Democrats want open borders and crime, crime, crime happens automatically when you have those open borders.	0
[Booing]	0
The Democrats want to let the country be overrun.	0
Just take a look at what's going on.	0
Everybody comes in, including the vile gang, MS-13, which Nancy Pelosi has gone out and wants to protect, OK?	1
We don't want to protect them.	0
Do you remember two weeks ago, you remember that.	0
Republicans love our military.	0
They love our vets and our police.	0
The Democrats are always fighting against funding for the military, and funding for law enforcement.	0
Figure that one out.	0
Democrats are now launching vicious smears against our incredible ICE officers and our Border Patrol agents.	0
Every single day the men and women of ICE and the CBP work long hours in the most dangerous conditions you can imagine, to defend our families, and to defend our communities, and to defend our borders, and defend us.	0
And I'll tell you what.	0
You know, far fewer people are coming through, as much as I complain, coming through our southern border.	0
And now it's getting worse because we have so much opportunity here.	0
We have done so well.	0
And we want people to come into our country.	0
But we want them to come into our country based on merit.	0
Merit.	0
Not picked out of a jar.	0
And we're sending MS-13 out by the thousands.	0
By the thousands.	0
We're liberating towns in Long Island.	0
We are sending MS-13 out.	0
You know, our ICE officers, they're tough.	0
I have got to say it.	0
It's not nice.	0
But they're mean.	0
But they have heart.	0
But they go into these towns, in Long Island.	0
I grew up in Long Island, right next to Long Island.	0
And these are towns that I know all my life.	0
They're being liberated, like a foreign power has taken over the towns.	0
Our ICE goes in there.	0
They grab 'em by the neck.	0
They throw 'em in the paddy wagon.	0
We get 'em the hell out of our country.	0
And the Democrats are constantly complaining that we're too rough on ICE.	0
Do you believe it?	0
Do you see what they do?	0
Bing, bing.	0
Right?	0
You see what they're doing?	0
No, but do you see what they're doing?	0
They don't need guns.	0
They like knives, because knives are much more painful.	0
They cut people up in small pieces.	0
Beautiful young women, walking home from school.	0
And the Democrats complain that we're treating them too rough.	0
We're getting them the hell out, as I said, by the thousands.	0
Right?	0
Just days ago, a brave border agent was shot multiple times while protecting our border.	0
Every day, border agents are keeping drugs, crime, and gangs from entering our country.	0
We're going to get that wall built.	0
We've already started it.	1
$1.6 billion.	0
We're getting the wall built.	1
Build that wall!	0
Build that wall!	0
Build that wall!	0
It's already begun, and it's beautiful.	0
And I'll tell you what, they may not want to talk about it in California, but those people in San Diego are very happy with Donald Trump.	0
I'm building that wall, and they are so happy.	0
They are so happy.	0
In recent days, we've heard of shameless attacks on these courageous law enforcement officers.	0
Extremist Democrat politicians have called for the complete elimination of ICE.	0
We don't want ICE anymore.	0
You know what would happen to parts of our country?	0
It would be overrun with the worst criminal elements you have ever seen.	0
Left-wing activists are trying to block ICE officers from doing their jobs, and publicly posting their home addresses, putting these incredible people and their families in harm's way.	0
[Booing]	0
These radical Democrat protesters, they really want anarchy.	0
But the only response they will find from our government is very strong law and order.	0
We will not tolerate attacks on our law enforcement.	0
We will protect our law enforcement, like they protect us.	0
We will always stand proudly with our brave heroes of ICE, the Border Patrol, the sheriffs, the police, yes, the firemen.	0
The foremen sometimes are under attack, if you can believe it.	0
The firemen.	0
These are great people.	0
And we have their backs.	0
Thanks to Republican leadership, America is winning again, and America is being respected again all over the world.	0
We're respected again.	0
All over the world, we're respected again.	0
You know, all those red hats and the white hats, Make America Great Again.	0
Right?	0
Make America Great Again.	0
And that's what we're doing.	0
And what are we going -- what are we going to say in two and a half years for the next campaign?	0
It's called Keep America Great, exclamation point.	0
Exclamation point.	0
Keep America Great!	0
"We gained $7 trillion in value, trillion with a ""t""."	0
Trillion.	0
I have wealthy friends, like Harold Hamm.	0
They don't even know what a trillion represents.	0
"I say, ""Harold, how many billion are in a trillion?"""	0
And I'm not sure that Harold could answer that.	0
But I'll tell you what.	0
We've gained tremendous worth, economic worth, and other worth, more important worth.	0
We're respected again, we're putting America first, we're making great trade deals.	0
$7 trillion.	0
Think of what that it.	0
And people don't realize this.	0
And we're going to get along with China.	0
And we're going to get along with the European Union, which has barriers from our farmers and our people, selling product into the European Union.	0
Last year, with the European Union, and we love the European Union.	0
We love the countries of the European Union.	0
But the European Union, of course, was set up to take advantage of the United States, to attack our piggy bank, right?	0
And you know what, we can't let that happen.	0
Last year, with the European Union, we lost $151 billion on trade.	0
We had a trade deficit of $151 billion, because they send the Mercedes in.	0
They send the BMWs in.	0
They send their products in.	0
"We send things to them, they say, ""No, thank you."	0
"We don't take your product."""	0
That's not the way it works.	0
And for all those free traders out there, that's not free trade.	0
That's stupid trade.	0
[Laughter]	0
That's stupid trade.	0
So -- so, I said to them, as the great Harold Hamm would say, because to him it's a natural thing, to some of the people in here it's a nat -- because I know some of the people.	0
They're great business people.	0
"I said to the, very simply, ""Look."	0
"If you treat us that way, and if you don't take down your barriers"" -- they call them trade -- you know what they call them."	0
Non-monetary barriers.	0
They're barriers.	0
Just like charging a big tariff, they charge us many times tariff.	0
If we send them a car which they don't want, and they practically don't take, but on the assumption it got through, they charge us many, many times what we charge them.	0
"And I said, ""Look."	0
"If you're not going to treat us fairly, if you're not going to treat our workers, our companies, our farmers fairly, if you're not going to take our farm products like we take your farm products, then we're going to tax all of those beautiful Mercedes Benzes that are coming in, and we're going to tax BMWs that are coming in..."""	0
... and we're already taxing, through tariffs, their steel and their aluminum.	0
And, by the way, do you see what's happening with our steel industry in the last four months?	0
It's booming again, folks.	0
It's booming.	0
United States Steel is opening up six plants through expansion and new.	0
I was in South Carolina the other night where, by the way, a great candidate won very easily.	0
You know, our track record is extraordinarily good, right?	0
That's why I'm here, for Kevin, that's why.	0
That's why I'm here.	0
But they just announced the day I get there, they have a steel company called Georgetown.	0
It's been closed for four years.	0
They announced the day before I got to South Carolina that Georgetown Steel is reopening and hiring 600 people.	0
Not so complicated.	0
We put tariffs on solar panels because China was flooding the market and it wasn't good stuff.	0
We had 32 plants.	0
Two were open and they were barely breathing.	0
They were mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.	0
We put a 30 percent tax on solar panels coming into the United States.	0
Now, those two plants are doing great.	0
And they're talking about opening at least 10, 11, or 12, and they'll probably have them all open very soon.	0
And they're going to make high quality panels.	0
And a lot of jobs.	0
Same thing with washing machines.	0
Sounds sort of tacky.	0
Washing machines.	0
Big business.	0
They were dumping, different countries -- I don't even want to tell you this country because I actually like this country, but, you know, they all -- sometimes our worst enemies are our so-called friends or allies, right?	0
But they were dumping washing machines.	0
We put a big tariff on, 30 percent.	0
We're now making washing machines back in our country.	0
But what else are we doing?	0
Think of it.	0
Just think, because you never hear this from the fake news.	0
[Laughter]	0
What else are we doing?	0
No, what else?	0
We're creating jobs, number one.	0
And we're taking in billions and billions of dollars into our coffers.	0
You know, there was a time -- there was a time when we had tariffs, because you had presidents like President McKinley and Roosevelt and others.	0
Roosevelt, one, who liked the idea of foreign countries, when they come in and want to take our wealth, they have to pay for it.	0
They don't take it.	0
On top of everything else, so they take our wealth, and we even protect them with our military.	0
We protect everybody.	0
So, we get it every which way.	0
So, we want to just tell those people, number one, we created a lot of jobs.	0
Number two, what's happening is we're taking in billions and billions -- look at the steel.	0
We have a 25 percent tariff.	0
We're taking in billions of dollars, creating jobs, and -- and, you know what?	0
Even if it wasn't perfect, we need a steel industry.	0
We were going to have no steel plants.	0
If something ever happened -- if something ever happened, you know what I'm talking about, and we needed steel to make that something, we wouldn't be able to make steel.	0
We need -- you know, there are some industries, steel and aluminum, we have got to have it.	0
So, we have jobs, we have a vibrant industry, in a short -- the head of United States Steel called me the other day.	0
"And he said, ""Mr. President, I'd like to thank you."	0
I have never seen anything like it.	0
We haven't opened up a new plant in 32 years.	0
And now we're opening up seven of them.	0
Six of them extensions.	0
"We're going to build a new one."""	0
And that's just one company.	0
The Heritage Foundation reported that in just the first 500 days of our presidency -- not my presidency.	0
It's our presidency, let's face it.	0
It's not my presidency.	0
You're the one that did it.	0
You're the one that did it.	0
Although I've been a good student.	0
I told John, and I told the whole group.	0
We had a whole group of politicians before.	0
And, you know, some of them have been congressmen, like, for 25, 30 years.	0
And they're asking me questions about politics.	0
"I said, ""I've only been doing this for two and half years."	0
"Don't ask me a question like that."""	0
[Laughter]	0
But we've been good students, haven't we, altogether?	0
Haven't we been good students?	0
But the Heritage Foundation came out with a report, and this was as of two months ago.	0
We've already implemented 64 percent of our top agenda items.	0
And that's at a much faster pace than even Ronald Reagan.	0
That's pretty good, right?	0
And you don't hear this from the fake news.	0
We've created 3.4 million new jobs since election day, 3.4.	0
Unemployment -- think of this one.	0
Unemployment claims are at a 45-year low, and it's going to 63, I believe, probably, next month.	0
African-American unemployment is at its lowest level in the history of our country.	0
Hispanic-American unemployment also is at the lowest point in the history of our country.	0
Unemployment among women, women... remember, we were going to do so poorly with women.	0
Look at all the women here tonight.	0
Women for Trump.	0
They never take those cameras off my face.	0
Look at all the women.	0
Remember we were going to do so poorly with women.	0
We did great with the women.	0
If -- I wouldn't be standing...	0
"My wife told me, she said, ""You're going to do great with the women."""	0
It's hard to believe it, though, with the kind of press we get.	0
Do you agree?	0
But, you know what?	0
They are so smart.	0
And when they hear those numbers, they're happy.	0
And when you hear the numbers -- I used to go into arenas, and I'd read the horrible statistics on crime and education, and how badly people are being treated in Hispanic communities, in African-American communities.	0
"And you remember, I'd go and I'd say, ""You've been voting for Democrats for 100 years."	0
"You have these horrible""-- look at my friends, right there."	0
Great guys.	0
My friends.	0
Thank you.	0
You've had these horrible, horrible statistics for years on crime and the educational abuse, and all of the things.	0
And I went in, and I'm reading them, point after point, and I'm seeing, and I'm -- I looked out at the audience.	0
For 100 years they were with Democrats.	0
The Democrats felt they had automatic votes.	0
"And I said to them, ""What the hell do you have to lose?"	0
Vote for me.	0
What do you have to lose?	0
What do you have to lose?	0
And I came off the stage.	0
I'll never forget it.	0
The first time I just said it.	0
I just said it.	0
I didn't care.	0
I -- honestly, I want to say what's right.	0
I don't care.	0
"I came off the stage and my political people said, ""Sir, that's a horrible thing."""	0
What's a horrible thing?	0
When you say, 'what the hell do you have to lose?'	0
That's a horrible thing.	0
"I said, ""But it's true."	0
"What the hell do you have to lose?"""	0
And now, I just said African-American unemployment is at the lowest level in history.	0
Very, very good. Thank you,	0
[Inaudible]	0
.	0
Thank you. Thank you,	0
[Inaudible]	0
.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Thank you.	0
So, we keep going, and we keep striving.	0
And when it's all over, nobody's done the job that we've all done.	0
Wages are rising.	0
You know, for those of you that were with the campaign, which I think was probably about 130 percent of you...	0
... you would hear me talking about wages.	0
Where a person would have a job 21 years ago, 19 years ago from two years, where we were doing the campaign.	0
And they made more money 19 years ago, relatively speaking, by far, than they made two years ago.	0
And, actually, one year ago.	0
Their wages were going along, and they had one job.	0
And now they'd have two and three jobs.	0
They'd be working much harder and making much less money.	0
And now, for the first time in 22 years, wages are rising again.	1
And even more importantly than that is, you have a choice of jobs.	0
It's like the V.A.	0
We approved choice.	0
They've been trying to do it for 45 years.	0
Choice.	0
You have choice in a job.	0
But the vets -- and you have great vets in North Dakota.	0
Vets, vets, vets.	0
So, remember, I used to say about the vets -- and I wasn't a great student of the vets, but I'd read where the vets would be online for 13 days, 18 days, three weeks, seven days.	0
And they'd start off, and they wouldn't be in bad shape.	0
And sometimes it would take so long before seeing a doctor that they would be terminally ill.	0
Things that could have been taken care of.	0
And I said, without knowing anything -- I thought it was the most brilliant policy I've ever heard.	0
"I said, ""Why don't they just go to a doctor, local, that's looking for the business, that would be a very good doctor."	0
We'll specify certain great doctors.	0
Go to a doctor.	0
Be taken care of.	0
"And we will pay the bill, and it will be much less expensive, and you'll be all set, right?"""	0
Right?	0
And I thought that was so brilliant.	0
"I said, ""Oh, I am so smart."	0
"I am the smartest person."""	0
My uncle was a great professor at MIT for 40 years.	0
Can you believe?	0
Forty years.	0
"I said, ""But I'm smarter than him."	0
"I'm smarter than anybody."""	0
And you know what?	0
I'll tell you.	0
I came in, and I said that to a group of people that are professionals and have been working with the vets for a long time.	0
"They said, ""Yeah, we know about that."	0
We've been trying to get it for 30 years.	0
"We couldn't get it approved."""	0
So, I was so disappointed, because I thought it was my idea.	0
But I'll tell you what I was good at.	0
[Laughter]	0
I was good at getting it done.	0
We got it done.	0
I signed it.	0
That's what I was good at.	0
I got it done.	0
We got it done.	0
They'd been trying to get it done for 40 years.	0
I was so disappointed.	0
I thought it was my idea.	0
That's the only problem.	0
I thought it was my idea.	0
And, you know, we have another thing.	0
Accountability with the vets.	0
The V.A.	0
-- there was no accountability.	0
You'd have people that were protected, whether it was civil service unions, who cares.	0
They were protected.	0
You couldn't fire them.	0
They could be sadists, and we had sadists.	0
Sick people.	0
We had people that would steal and rob.	0
We had a lot of bad people.	0
We had people that didn't work hard.	0
And there was no accountability.	0
For 40 years they tried to get the V.A.	0
Accountability Act passed.	0
I got it passed.	0
"And now, you look at the guy that did it, and you say, ""Jim Smith, you've done a hell of a lousy job."	0
You're late, and you don't treat our vets right.	0
Jim, I'm sorry, you're fired.	0
"Get out of here."""	0
Right?	0
Right?	0
Jim, you're fired.	0
USA!	0
USA!	0
USA!	0
So, those two things for the -- I just approved them.	0
The accountability was a couple of months ago.	0
And John helped so much.	0
I'll tell you.	0
John helped so much.	0
He was a leader.	0
Thank you.	0
He was a leader on both.	0
And everybody said you couldn't get accountability done.	0
"I said, ""Why?"""	0
Too much power, too many unions, too many people that just don't want it done.	0
You had people in Arizona that robbed $300,000 and they could -- they agreed.	0
Everybody agreed.	0
They robbed the money.	0
They couldn't fire the people.	0
So now you have -- accountability is done.	0
And I think even more important -- I'm not sure.	0
But even more important, V.A.	0
choice.	0
So now you go see a doctor when you have to wait on line.	0
OK?	0
Optimism among America's great manufacturers has hit 95 percent, the highest number by far in the history of the survey, which is a very old survey.	0
We have eliminated record numbers of job-killing regulations.	0
I think maybe as important as the tax cuts are the regulations.	0
Our country was choking.	0
And let me tell you, if our opponent, our wonderful opponent...	0
Lock her up!	0
... when is she going to get over it?	0
When does she get over it?	0
Lock her up!	0
Lock her up!	0
Lock her up!	0
Oy, when do they get over it?	0
But, you know, it is pretty amazing.	0
Point after point, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty.	0
Oh, she's OK.	0
And then they go after us for a Russian hoax.	0
It's a witch hunt hoax.	0
It's -- isn't it incredible, when you talk about a double standard?	0
When you talk about a double standard.	0
And nobody even looks at her.	0
Nobody even looks, I don't think, unless we're going to be surprised some day.	0
Well, we'll see how that works out.	0
But I'll tell you what.	0
What's happened is somewhat of a miracle because we weren't expected to win.	0
But every time I'd go out, we'd have crowds like this.	0
We went to Michigan.	0
We went to Wisconsin.	0
We went to places that haven't been done.	0
I think Wisconsin was 1952.	0
Dwight Eisenhower.	0
And we won Wisconsin.	0
"And Wisconsin, I went there, and I said, ""I think we're going to win this state."""	0
"And people said to me, ""Oh, sir."	0
"It won't happen."""	0
"I said, ""Why?"	0
Look at the crowds we're getting.	0
Look at the people.	0
Look at the signs outside of the house.	0
"Look at the signs."""	0
I heard, and maybe it's not so, that Bill Clinton, President Bill Clinton, went back, and he went through Michigan.	0
"And he said, ""You'd better get some people out to Michigan, because there's a Trump-Pence sign on every house."	0
"You'd better get people out."""	0
"And they said, ""Oh, no."	0
"Our statistics show that Michigan cannot be won by the Republicans."""	0
Well, let me tell you what's happened.	0
Car plants are moving into Michigan.	0
Jobs are moving into Michigan.	0
Michigan's very happy with your president.	0
They should have listened to Bill Clinton.	0
They should have listened.	0
And we just had our highest poll numbers.	0
And I watch these fakers back there, and they'll be talking.	0
[Booing]	0
Well, you saw the polls that come out -- I don't know if this is true.	0
You know, a year and a half ago, they said I was an interloper.	0
How bad is that?	0
An interloper.	0
And now they say, and you will admit, a thing comes out, a big poll, and a couple of polls.	0
"A number of polls that, ""He's the most powerful, most popular, Republican in the history of the party."""	0
And a little while ago I was an interloper.	0
"They came out ""more popular than"" a man I like, Ronald Reagan."	0
Well -- but think of it.	0
You go from interloper -- that's a horrible term, right?	0
I was just doing my thing.	0
I'm not an interloper.	0
But we have tremendous -- look at the people.	0
We endorsed Dan Donovan.	0
He was behind.	0
We endorsed him.	0
He won by, like, 24 points or something last night, in Staten Island, New York, and New York generally.	0
Dan Donovan, Congressman.	0
Last night we had a great evening because we watched that television and we were winning left and right.	0
They didn't know what the hell happened. And one of my biggest critics, a slovenly man named Joe Crowley, got his ass kicked...	0
[Laughter]	0
... by a young woman who had a lot of energy.	0
She had a lot of energy.	0
I guess he didn't see it.	0
They couldn't find him.	0
He spent a lot of money.	0
He actually had a lot of money left over.	0
Everyone is pouring a fortune because they figure -- and he was going to take Nancy Pelosi's place.	0
And I was so disappointed, because I want to keep Nancy Pelosi right where she is, with Maxine Waters.	0
I want to keep Nancy Pelosi.	0
Please, I want to make a plea to my Democrat friends.	0
Please, please, please don't remove Nancy Pelosi.	0
She should be where she is.	0
And please keep Maxine Waters on the air, as your face and your mouthpiece for the Democrat Party.	0
Please.	0
Maxine and Nancy.	0
So, I was disappointed in a way when he got beaten, because he was going to take her place, I think.	0
"Now, he's just looking at us and saying, ""Darling, what happened?"""	0
Politics is a mean game, isn't it?	0
It's a mean -- it's a fleeting game.	0
Six months ago, Republicans passed the biggest tax cuts and reform in American history.	0
Thank you.	0
Our plan doubled the child tax credit, thank you to Ivanka Trump.	0
She wanted that so badly.	0
She really got to be a pest.	0
Dad, you've got to get child tax credit.	0
"I said, ""Darling, nobody knows what it is."""	0
"She said, ""The women know, Dad."	0
"The women know."""	0
My daughter and my wife, Melania, they love -- they love the women.	0
And the women love them.	0
The women love them.	0
And the men love them.	0
Child tax credits.	0
People don't talk about it that much.	0
It's very substantial.	0
And you know we got it for you.	0
We slashed taxes for working families, most of them in half, and saved our family farms and our small businesses by eliminating the estate tax in almost all cases.	0
It's known as the death tax.	0
And now, when you leave your small business or your farm, you leave it to your children.	0
Your children don't go -- have to back.	0
They don't go to the bank, borrow money, and end up losing the farm or losing the business.	0
Thank Kevin and John and the whole group, they helped us a lot.	0
And guess what.	0
Heidi voted against it.	0
OK?	0
She voted against it.	0
[Booing]	0
Heidi voted against it.	0
And she's always going to vote against it.	0
And by the way, she may give us a couple of quickie votes, you know, before the election.	0
She might, because she has no choice.	0
But the day after that election, she's voting party line, 100 percent.	0
More than 100 utility companies nationwide have slashed prices for customers, saving them and this country much more than $3 billion, which goes and reduces your electric and utility bill.	0
Heidi and every single Democrat voted against our tax cuts.	0
We're also fixing the disastrous trade deals that have plundered our wealth, gutted our communities, undermined our great farmers, taken our jobs.	0
We are going to make trade fair and reciprocal.	0
Reciprocal.	0
You know what that is.	0
They do it to us.	0
We do it to them.	0
And we are placing very big tariffs on some of these countries, because they have tariffs on us.	0
It's incredible.	0
I wonder where these people come from.	0
Even politicians.	0
So, we'll have a country.	0
It doesn't matter.	0
I can almost name any of them.	0
They have massive tariffs on our people, on our workers, on our farmers, on our country, on our companies.	0
So, we say we're going to put tariffs on them.	0
And I'll actually have politicians and other people come to me.	0
Oh, please.	0
We want free trade.	0
How is it free trade?	0
I'll give you an example.	0
China.	0
If we make a car and sell it into China, they charge us a 25 percent tax.	0
That's what it is.	0
Twenty-five percent.	0
When they make a car and sell it into the United States, and there are a lot of them, we charge them the grand total of 2.5 percent, and they don't pay that.	0
[Booing]	0
And then when I want to raise the game and play the game of poker, a game that we can't lose, I'll get even politicians, mostly Democrats, but even a couple of Republicans.	0
"They'll say, ""We want free trade."""	0
That's not free trade.	0
That's not fair trade.	0
It is so ridiculous.	0
Just play the game for a little while.	0
It's a game we can't lose.	0
"You know, I've said a couple of times, when we're $500 billion down, they say, ""Trump is starting a trade war."""	0
I say no.	0
The trade war ended a long time ago, and the United States lost because our leaders didn't take care of our people and our companies.	0
So, we're not starting a trade war, but we'll finish it.	0
And you know what?	0
In the end, you know what's going to happen.	0
And it's already happening.	0
Already happening.	0
"They're going to come to us, and they're going to say, ""Hey, let's work it out."""	0
And we're going to work it out.	0
It's very simple.	0
But remember -- it is.	0
It's the art of the deal, but anybody can do the deal.	0
There are a lot of people.	0
This one doesn't get much simple.	0
Remember, it's true.	0
When you're $500 billion down, you can't lose.	0
You already lost.	0
But now we're going to start winning.	0
Or at least we're going to make it fair.	0
It doesn't even have to -- we've got to make it fair.	0
And the fact that we've had presidents and we've had leaders that worked for those presidents, negotiators, trade reps, who were missing in action.	0
They weren't doing their job.	0
You know, I was dealt a lot of bad hands.	0
I was given North Korea where, frankly, we were very close to going to war.	0
You could have lost 30 million people, 50 million people.	0
Seoul is 30 miles off the border.	0
They have what they call cannons, like howitzers.	0
They have cannons, thousands of them, pointed.	0
I had the meeting.	0
We had a great relationship.	0
We had a great chemistry together.	0
The fake news was so upset when I said we had a good relationship.	0
We had a good chemistry.	0
"They said, ""That's a horrible thing."""	0
No, no.	0
It's a good thing.	0
Getting along with countries, getting along with China, getting along with Russia, getting along with these countries is a good thing.	0
It's not a bad thing.	0
Not a bad thing.	0
And so, we have things cooking now.	0
You're going to be so happy.	0
But when people rush it -- you know, it's like rushing the turkey out of the stove.	0
It's not going to be as good.	0
The women can tell me, and some of the men.	0
See, today I have to be politically correct. See, in the old days...	0
[Laughter]	0
"... in the old days I would have never -- I just would have said, ""Oh, I don't want to."	0
"It's too hokey."""	0
But it's true.	0
Some of the men can tell me, too.	0
Right?	0
Some of the men.	0
But here's what we do.	0
The more they rush, the worse it's going to be.	0
The longer we take, the better.	0
Your farmers, your people are going to be great.	0
You know, John -- I'll tell you, John and Kevin gave me something.	0
They just told me this.	0
Canadian wheat markets consistently discriminate against the United States' wheat by grading it as feed.	0
Do you know what that means?	0
They know what it means.	0
I don't know what the hell it means.	0
I just know it's a bad deal.	0
[Laughter]	0
But it's true.	0
Canada charges us on dairy products a tariff of 275 percent, for you farmers in here.	0
Two hundred.	0
"That's like saying, ""We don't want your dairy products."""	0
It's no good.	0
"That's like saying, ""We don't want North Dakota, Wisconsin, New York State."	0
"We don't want you there."""	0
Two hundred and seventy-five percent.	0
And I actually hear that's an old number.	0
They raised it a number of months ago to 300 percent.	0
How horrible is that?	0
And then Justin gets up.	0
"He said, ""We fought World War I, we fought World War II,"" all true, ""together."""	0
All true.	0
We love Canada.	0
But they're taking advantage of us.	0
We can't let that happen.	0
We can't let it happen.	0
The era of global freeloading and taking advantage of the United States is over.	0
It's just over.	0
We're also restoring American security by rebuilding our military.	0
We've secured a historic $700 billion.	0
Just got it approved.	0
$700 billion.	0
We're rebuilding our military.	0
And next year, already approved, $716 billion.	0
We're rebuilding our military.	0
It will be bigger and stronger than ever before.	0
And hopefully we will never have to use it, because when it's bigger and stronger, you tend not to have to use it, OK?	0
And in addition to that, we got $6 billion for drugs and fighting opioid abuse.	0
$6 billion.	0
We believe in peace.	0
But it's got to be peace through strength, not weakness.	0
Peace through strength.	0
And I've directed the Pentagon to begin the process of creating a sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces, called the Space Force.	0
The Space Force.	0
Space Force.	0
Because space is the new frontier.	0
And I'm not just talking about going to up to the moon and going to Mars.	0
And I want the rich guys -- you know, we have rich guys.	0
They love these rockets.	0
"I said, ""Lease them the land."	0
Charge them a lot.	0
"They'll..."" -- they just want to send rockets."	0
But I look at it, with Bezos, with Elon Musk, they all love rockets.	0
"I said, ""That's OK. Let's do it."""	0
Let them send a rocket up to Mars.	0
Let's be the first.	0
I hope they go fast.	0
Let's help them.	0
Let's make it really good for them.	0
And if they do it, we're going to claim it on behalf of the United States, OK?	0
We'll give them no credit.	0
Let them spend the money.	0
I think it's great.	0
But I have a lot of military guys.	0
And space, from a military standpoint, is really the new frontier.	0
So, we're going to have a Space Force.	0
Every day we are keeping our promises.	0
But to keep this momentum going, we need Kevin Cramer in the Senate.	0
All of us tonight are united by the same tireless values.	0
We have pride in our history, respect for our great, beautiful, wonderful American flag, right?	0
We put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance.	0
And we proudly stand for our national anthem.	0
Right?	0
Proudly stand.	0
In everything we do, we are standing up for our citizens.	0
We are standing up for America, and we are standing up for North Dakota.	0
Thank you.	0
The forgotten men and women of our country are forgotten no more.	0
No more.	0
They don't know where they all came from.	0
And by the way, our people, they call it the base, they used to say it's 35.	0
Then they said it's 40.	0
Then they said it's 42.	0
Then they have these polls go -- we're driving them crazy.	0
Now they say it's over 50 percent And then they said -- some great people.	0
"They said, ""Any time Trump gets a poll, add 12 to it."""	0
Really.	0
And did you ever notice -- I hate it.	0
I meet these people.	0
They call them the elite.	0
These people.	0
I look at them.	0
"I say, ""That's elite?"""	0
We got more money.	0
We got more brains.	0
We got better houses, apartments.	0
We got nicer boats.	0
We're smarter than they are.	0
"And they say, ""The elite."""	0
We're the elite.	0
You're the elite.	0
We're the elite.	0
"So, I said the other day, ""Let's keep calling these people."""	0
And look, let's face it.	0
They've been stone cold losers, the elite.	0
The elite.	0
So, let's let them keep calling themselves the elite.	0
But we're going to call ourselves -- and remember, you are indeed.	0
You work harder, but you are indeed smarter than them.	0
Let's call ourselves from now on the super-elite.	0
We're the super-elite.	0
We are the super-elite.	0
You are the people who farm the prairies, tame the badlands, and squeeze oil out of rock.	0
Ugh.	0
You celebrate your heritage, and you live life proudly under the big beautiful skies.	0
And you have the big beautiful skies out here.	0
Loyal citizens like you helped rebuild this country and together we are taking back our country, returning power to the everyday, smart, brilliant, wonderful, hard-working American people.	0
We are standing on the shoulders of the American patriots who settled the frontier, scaled the Rockies, and won the American west.	0
These are great, incredible, strong tough, tough people.	0
This state was forged by pioneer men and women who braved the cold and tamed the wilderness to build a home on the plains and a life for their families.	0
And it's been an incredible life.	0
These North Dakota pioneers were tough as hell and they were strong and they were smart.	0
And they all had one thing in common.	0
They loved their families.	0
They loved their countries, and they loved their God.	0
They never gave up and they never, ever, gave in.	0
And neither will we.	0
We will never stop fighting for our country, our families, and we will never, ever, stop fighting for our freedom.	0
As long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, we will never ever fail.	0
With your help, with your voice, with your vote, we will win, win, win.	0
Like we're doing.	0
Remember how I started.	0
This country, our country, our flag, we are respected again.	0
All over the world they're talking about us.	0
"Leaders from all over the world, they call me, or they come to the Oval Office, and they say, ""Congratulations, Mr. President, on the incredible job with the economy, the incredible job you're doing with your country."	0
The fact that your country is respected again, congratulations, Mr.	0
"President."""	0
Because we are Americans, and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue.	0
We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.	0
And together, we will make America wealthy again.	0
We will, and are, making America strong again.	0
We will make America safe again.	0
Look at our military.	0
We will make our great, great America stronger and more powerful than ever before.	0
We will make America loving again.	0
Love it.	0
Love it.	0
We're going to come together.	0
And we will make America great again.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, North Dakota.	0
Go out and get Kevin Cramer in the -- thank you, Kevin.	0
Thank you, everybody.	0
Thank you, North Dakota.	0
It's a great honor.	0
Thank you.	0
Mr. President, I am so glad to see you.	0
I'm so proud of everything you're doing.	0
Thank you.	0
Let me ask you.	0
You have just gotten back from the G-20.	0
You were traveling around the world.	0
What do you see as the major problem facing the world today?	0
What's the major issue?	0
Well we have many problems.	0
And I was left a very, very tough meal.	0
I will say that.	0
It was a mess.	0
And I think we're doing very well.	0
But North Korea certainly is a big problem.	0
The; Middle East is a total mess.	0
Other than in five months we have done more against ISIS than anybody has done since the beginning.	0
And we're having tremendous success with that.	0
But I would have to say, Middle East is a tough situation.	0
But we're getting it straightened out.	0
And ultimately, we want to start investing money back in the United States at our home.	0
Yeah.	0
But we have to get rid of ISIS.	0
We have to get rid of the terrorists, as you know better than anybody.	0
And the other is North Korea.	0
We have somebody that is -- we will find out what he is.	0
We're going to find out.	0
He has launched intercontinental missiles.	0
Is there a possibility that we might want to knock some of those down on the launch pad or right after launch?	0
Well, we wouldn't want to be speaking about anything.	0
But we're looking at lots of different ways.	0
We're working with other countries, including China.	0
I think China would like to see this problem go away.	0
It's a big problem for them.	0
And, you know, the advantage we have is trade.	0
We have big trade with China.	0
And I have a very good relationship with President Xi, who I like a lot.	0
And I think he likes me.	0
We were just spending a lot of time together.	0
And they are very strong with regard to, as you know, with regard to North Korea.	0
Will they get tough with North Korea?	0
I know that you were so close when he was there visiting Mar-a-Lago.	0
Well, we're going to see.	0
We're going to see.	0
I would say that we had a good chance.	0
They had an election where President Moon got elected to South Korea.	0
He has a much different attitude -- or a much different take -- on how to handle this situation than his predecessor in South Korea.	0
He's perhaps softer on the issue, but maybe not, because I like him a lot.	0
I think he's going to be a strong person.	0
I think he's got strong views -- stronger than people would understand.	0
So we'll see how it all works out.	0
I think China wants to help us.	0
We're going to find out whether or not they do.	0
But China would, in my opinion, like to be able to help us.	0
What's our leverage with them?	0
Well, our leverage with China is that China makes hundreds of billions of dollars a year with us on trade.	0
And I want to renegotiate trade deals.	0
But I would certainly be a lot easier in a trade deal if they were going to help us with North Korea than if they weren't.	0
So we're going to see.	0
The relationship is very good with China.	0
It's very good with the president of China, who's a terrific person.	0
We will find out whether or not they want to help.	0
And maybe they do.	0
And maybe they don't.	0
What about that consortium of Arab nations that went against Qatar.	0
Your secretary of state was not too favorable to what was being done.	0
How are we going to handle that one?	0
Well, Rex is doing a terrific job.	0
But he and I had a little bit of a difference, only in terms of tone.	0
So we went to Saudi Arabia.	0
We had one of the great meetings ever -- 54 Muslim countries.	0
And I got up, made a speech, got nice reviews.	0
It's almost like you making a speech.	0
But I said, we've got to stop the funding of terrorism.	0
Tremendous money, and they're funding terrorism.	0
So we've got to stop it.	0
So they are working very hard on that.	0
And I believe they're going to do it.	0
It was one of the most incredible two days.	0
As an example, Saudi Arabia put up hundreds of billions of dollars of money going into buying our planes and our military equipment and investing in our country.	1
And I said, you have to do that.	0
Otherwise I'm not going.	0
So they spent hundreds of billions of dollars right in front of us.	0
They were signing and big people from the biggest countries in companies -- General Electric, and all of the big companies.	0
Many of them were there getting contracts.	0
All good work for our workers.	0
That was one of the things.	0
But the other thing is that -- and very important to me -- was the funding of terrorism has to stop.	0
And they fund terrorism -- some of those countries, many of those countries.	0
So we had a tremendous summit.	0
And I think things are going to work out.	0
I think it was a very, very important and very impressive two days.	0
And now, as you know, Qatar -- which a lot of people call it Qatar -- but Qatar is now a little bit on the outs.	0
But I think they are being brought back in.	0
Because they were known as a funder of terrorism.	0
And we said you can't do that.	0
You can't do that.	0
We have to starve the beast, right.	0
And the beast is terrorism.	0
So we can't have wealthy countries funding that beast.	0
How do we handle that big military installation we built in Qatar?	0
What do we do with that?	0
Well, we'll be all right.	0
Look, if we ever had to leave, we would have 10 countries willing to build us another one.	0
Believe me.	0
And they'll pay for it.	0
The days of us paying for things are going to be largely over.	0
They'll start paying.	0
We go out.	0
We build.	0
We this.	0
We that.	0
But you're right.	0
Qatar -- we're going to have a good relationship with Qatar.	0
And we're not going have a problem with the military base.	0
But if we ever needed another military base, you have other countries that would gladly build it.	0
Believe me.	0
You went to the G-20.	0
And you met for the first time, front face to face, with Vladimir Putin.	0
And George Bush had once said he stared into his soul and came away satisfied.	0
What do you think?	0
Can we trust him?	0
Well, look, we had a good meeting.	0
I think we had an excellent meeting.	0
One thing we did is we have a ceasefire in a major part of Syria where there was tremendous bedlam and tremendous killing.	0
And by the way, this is now four days.	0
The ceasefire has held for four days.	0
Those cease fires haven't held at all.	0
That's because President Putin and President Trump made the deal and it's held.	0
Now, I don't know what's going to happen.	0
Maybe as we're speaking they start shooting again.	0
But this has held, unlike all of the other cease fires that didn't mean anything.	0
So that was a great thing that came out of that meeting.	0
I think a lot of things came out of that meeting.	0
But I do believe it's important to have a dialogue.	0
And if you don't have a dialogue, it's a lot of problems for our country and for their country.	0
I think we need dialogue.	0
We need dialogue with everybody.	0
Sure.	0
It was a great G-20.	0
We had 20 countries.	0
I get along, I think, really fantastically with the head of every country.	0
Well, you're going to France right away to meet with Macron.	0
And you were there for Bastille Day instead of July the Fourth, that's their special holiday.	0
That's right.	0
Well I was invited by the president -- the new president of France -- who is a very good person, very good guy.	0
And don't forget, I terminated for our country the Paris Accord.	0
So that's not that easy for them.	0
But I terminated it, because it was not fair to our country.	0
We have other countries that had much better deals than we did, to put it just in a very simple form.	0
And I said, why do we not have a better deal?	0
And nobody could give me the answer.	0
I said, I'm terminating.	0
So I terminated.	0
But I'm going to be with the president.	0
And I think it's going to be very exciting.	0
It's 100 years since World War I.	0
Turns out to be the exact date.	0
So we're going to watch something that I think will be very beautiful.	0
And I think it's very important for our country to be represented 100 years since the First World War.	0
Lafayette, we are here.	0
We've come back.	0
Here we are.	0
Here we are.	0
Oh that's great.	0
Well back to Putin.	0
What do you think he wants?	0
I know he's said what he wants.	0
But what do you think his game is?	0
Well he wants what's good for Russia.	0
Yeah.	0
And I want what's good for the United States.	0
And I think, like in a case like Syria, where we can get together, do a cease fire -- and there are other cases or many other cases where getting along can be a very positive thing.	0
But always, Putin is going to want Russia.	0
And Trump is going to want United States.	0
And that's the way it is.	0
And sometimes, you're not going to get along on things.	0
And sometimes you will.	0
But we had a good meeting.	0
It was a face to face meeting.	0
It was a long meeting.	0
It was two hours and 15 minutes.	0
Everyone were surprised by the amount of time.	0
But that was a good thing, not a bad thing.	0
Sure.	0
Yeah, I think we got along very well.	0
And I think that's a good thing.	0
And that's not a bad thing.	0
Yeah, of course not.	0
People said, oh they shouldn't get along.	0
Well, who are the people that are saying that?	0
I think we got along very, very well.	0
We're a tremendously powerful nuclear power.	0
And so are they.	0
Sure It doesn't make sense not to have some kind of a relationship.	0
We used to have that thing called mutually assured destruction -- MAD.	0
And it's still there.	0
Because he can hurt us.	0
He can decimate our country.	0
And we can do the same thing to him.	0
It's something you don't even like talking about.	0
But again, we're the most powerful country in the world.	0
And we are getting more and more powerful.	0
Because I'm a big military person.	0
As an example, if Hillary had won, our military would be decimated.	0
Our energy would be much more expensive.	0
That's what Putin doesn't like about me.	0
And that's why I say, why would he want me?	0
Because from day one, I wanted a strong military.	0
He doesn't want to see that.	0
And from day one, I want fracking and everything else to get energy prices low and to create tremendous energy.	0
We're going to be self-supporting.	0
We just about are now.	0
We're going to be exporting energy.	0
He doesn't want that.	0
He would like Hillary, where she wants to have windmills.	0
He would much rather have that, because energy prices will go up.	0
And Russia, as you know, relies very much on energy.	0
There are many things that I do that are the exact opposite of what he would want.	0
So when I keep hearing about that he would have rather had Trump, I think probably not.	0
Because when I want a strong military, you know she wouldn't have spent the money on the military.	0
But when I want a strong military, and when I want tremendous energy, we're opening up coal.	0
We're opening up natural gas.	0
We're opening up fracking -- all the things that he would hate.	0
But nobody ever mentions it.	0
Well, Gazprom held Europe by the throat.	0
They were the monopoly.	0
And now the US is breaking into that monopoly with our exports of LNG, right?	0
Right.	0
We are.	0
We have LNG exporting all over.	0
We have taken off some of the regulations that would make it impossible for the energy companies, impossible for banks, impossible for a lot of different things.	0
You couldn't build a house in some places.	0
And many of those restrictions have been taken off.	0
Some are being taken off.	0
We have statutory waits, meaning you have to wait a certain period of time.	0
And the country is doing really well.	0
So the stock market is the highest it's ever been.	0
We have almost $4 trillion in gain.	0
$4 trillion, I hope you're taking advantage of that.	0
We have four -- almost $4 trillion --	0
I'm into the bargain --	0
But when you think of that, that's creating value.	0
We have a lot of tremendous things ready to go, tremendous projects all over the country.	0
Don't forget, when I came in, one of my first acts was the Keystone Pipeline.	1
Yeah.	0
And the Dakota Access Pipeline.	0
These two things got approved immediately.	0
They would have never been built.	0
And it's thousands and thousands of jobs.	1
And it was my honor.	0
To me, it was a no-brainer.	0
The regulatory burden on American business has been, really, worse than taxes.	0
And you have lifted -- how many regulations have you lifted so far?	0
Oh, just thousands.	0
And what we've done is we've given the farmers back their land.	0
We've given the home-builders the right to put up a house.	0
You had cases where a farm would have a little puddle someplace -- a puddle.	1
When I grew up, we used to call it a puddle, right -- you too, probably.	0
And they considered it a lake.	0
And if you touched it, bad, bad things happen to you and your family.	0
We've given the farmers back their farms.	0
We have so many things planned in the future too, with the tax cuts and the death taxes.	0
We're ending the death taxes.	0
There's so many things we have planned.	0
But the farmers are so happy now.	0
The home-builders are happy.	0
We have our most jobs ever in our country.	0
Now we have to take care of those people that have given up looking for a job.	0
You have a large group of people in this country that have given up.	0
I would talk about them a lot in speeches.	0
They've given up looking for jobs.	0
They're going to be looking very soon.	0
And they're going to be getting those jobs.	0
I was talking to Mike Pence a few minutes ago.	0
And he thinks that possibly that health care bill can go through.	0
There are two pieces of legislation that the American people are really anxious to see put through.	0
One is this iniquitous Obamacare has got to go and be replaced.	0
Number two, we've got to have a tax cut, especially for small businesses -- corporate tax.	0
How far along are you?	0
And number three is infrastructure, which we're going to do also.	0
Exactly.	0
But number one, repeal and replace.	0
I am sitting in the Oval Office with a pen in hand, waiting for our senators to give it to me.	0
For years, they've been talking about repeal and replace, repeal and replace.	0
I think they passed it 61 times -- repeal and replace.	0
But that didn't mean anything.	0
Because you had the minority, the Republicans.	0
They didn't have the majority, so it wasn't going to get to the president.	0
But if it ever did, Obama was going to sign it, so it didn't mean.	0
Now, we have a president that's waiting to sign it.	0
I have pen in hand.	0
So now it means something.	0
Those other times -- those many, many times that they passed it --	0
What's the hold up?	0
You have very good people.	0
These are very good people.	0
We have 52 senators.	0
It's very hard to get all -- we need almost all of them.	0
You need almost all of them.	0
And that's the holdup.	0
And states are somewhat different.	0
But with all of that being said, has to get passed.	0
They have to do it.	0
They have to get together and get it done.	0
What will happen if they don't?	0
Well, I don't want to talk about it.	0
Because I think it would be very bad.	0
I would be very angry about it.	0
And a lot of people will be very upset.	0
But I'm sitting waiting for that bill to come to my desk.	0
I hope that they do it.	0
They've been promising it for years.	0
They've been promising it ever since Obamacare, which has failed.	1
It's a failed experiment.	1
It is totally gone.	0
It's out of business.	0
And we have to get this done -- repeal and replace.	0
Mitch McConnell is a tactician of great skill.	0
You think he can pull it off?	0
It's his job.	0
He's got to pull it off.	0
Yeah.	0
Mitch has to pull it off.	0
He's working very hard.	0
He's got to pull it off.	0
All right, the next thing is taxes.	0
It looks like to me, lowering the corporate tax to get us in line with the rest of the world is, again, a no-brainer.	0
Can you get that one through?	0
I think after health care, taxes are going to be so easy.	0
Health care is very hard.	0
Health care is hard, because you'll do something a little bit this way, and you pick up that final vote, and you lose four votes over here.	0
Now you it back.	0
It's a very tiny little road.	0
It's about two feet wide.	0
And it goes throughout the country.	0
So health care is much tougher than taxes.	0
No, I think taxes are going to be very well.	0
In fact, our plan is we're talking about massive tax cuts -- the biggest tax cut in the history of our country.	0
We're going to get people back again.	0
We're going to bring back $4 trillion from overseas.	0
Money that can't come back into this country because of our tax code.	0
We're going to bring back $4 trillion -- could be more than that -- from corporations that can't get their money back into our country.	0
We're going to give a tremendous tax cut for the middle class.	0
We're bringing it down to 10%.	0
We're bringing corporate taxes down to 15%.	0
I hope we can get that number approved.	0
Maybe they'll want to do something and negotiate.	0
But if we get what we want, it will be the biggest tax cut and the greatest tax reform in the history of our country.	0
Would you settle for the tax cut without reforming the whole tax code?	0
Or would you like to work with the whole thing?	0
Well, I think we can do them simultaneously.	0
The code is too complicated.	0
H&R Block won't be happy.	0
But people go out.	0
They spend a lot of their money on getting other people to do their taxes.	0
I'm one of them.	0
I know.	0
You understand.	0
And it's unnecessary.	0
So simplification is very important.	0
Reform is very important.	0
And the biggest thing to me is tax cut.	0
We are going for very large tax cuts for businesses and for the middle class.	0
Tremendous tax cuts.	0
Chairman Brady is on board with what you want to do.	0
He's a great guy.	0
He will line up.	0
Have you got anybody in the Senate of like mind?	0
Well first of all, Chairman Brady is a great guy.	0
He really knows the subject.	0
He'll never disappoint you.	0
So they're, I think, really good.	0
In the Senate, I think we're going to do very well.	0
Again, like health care -- this is simpler than health care, believe it or not -- but like health care, I think we're going to get it done.	0
And then I want to go to infrastructure.	0
We have to rebuild our country -- our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our schools.	0
We have to rebuild our country.	0
Exactly.	0
You know, we will have, in another few months, have spent $7 trillion dollars in the Middle East.	0
$7 trillion.	0
And then if you want to spend $2 on building a school in Iowa or in Pennsylvania or in Florida, they don't want to give you the money.	0
But we've spent -- in a very short period of time -- we will be up to $7 trillion dollars.	0
How ridiculous is this?	0
And here's what we got for it.	0
Nothing.	0
Nothing.	0
The Middle East is a mess.	0
Now, I'm there for one reason.	0
We've got to get rid of the terrorists.	0
That's the reason.	0
And we're almost there.	0
We have really made headway.	0
We've made, as I said, we've made more headway in the last short period of time than they have ever before, by far, during this long period of time.	0
But when you think that we've spent -- we will have spent $7 trillion.	0
Think of it.	0
We've spent, as of a few months ago, we actually have spent $6 trillion in the Middle East.	0
But we have nothing for it.	0
Nothing.	0
I want to rebuild our bridges and our roads.	0
I have a friend who's a trucker.	0
And he loves -- he's very proud of his equipment.	0
He buys it very big.	0
And he buys the best trucks.	0
He's very proud of it.	0
He said in the past, when we went from Los Angeles to New York, it was fine.	0
Now by the time he gets to New York, with all the problems on the roads and potholes, he said I've got to fix my equipment all the time.	0
He wants to go to a different level of truck, meaning downward.	0
Where do you go --	0
We have to fix our roads.	0
And we have to fix our infrastructure.	0
So infrastructure is very important.	0
Somebody suggested the Federal Reserve has a big slush fund that maybe they could pass over for infrastructure without actually having to raise taxes.	0
How do you get the money for that?	0
Oh, we'll get the money.	0
We're going to get the money.	0
And we're going to grow.	0
And I say it.	0
We're going to grow.	0
We're going to have tremendous growth.	0
We're being held back by all these regulations, which I'm knocking out left and right.	0
Yeah.	0
Even Dodd-Frank, with the banking business.	0
I have people -- friends of mine -- they want to go get a loan.	0
They can't.	0
Great people, and they can't get loans.	0
We're doing things on Dodd-Frank, in terms of the banks.	0
We have many, many things that we're doing.	0
But we're going to have growth.	0
And we're going to grow out of our problems.	0
Hey, we owe $20 trillion dollars.	0
The Congressional Budget Office uses this.	0
They don't use dynamic scoring.	0
They use static scoring.	0
Can you get past them so you can --	0
We're going to get past it.	0
And we're going to get past it to a large extent, because we're going to have a country that's going to be much more dynamic.	0
If we do GDP at 1% -- because we're basically, for the last year, at around 1%.	0
I call countries like I'm friendly with all -- let's say, the top 20 countries where I just left.	0
How are you doing to a major country -- I won't use names -- oh, we are not happy.	0
We are not happy.	0
What's your GDP?	0
8%.	0
11%.	0
10%.	0
9%.	0
And I say, how you doing?	0
We are not happy.	0
So we're at 1% and we're supposed to be happy?	0
We have the highest taxes anywhere in the world.	0
We're going to lower them.	0
We're going to lower them substantially.	0
We're going to have tremendous growth.	0
I'd like to make a prediction.	0
If you get health care and tax reform, you're guaranteed another four years of office if you want it.	0
Well then I'll see you at the inauguration.	0
I am counting on it.	0
[Laughter]	0
Anyhow, well, I appreciate so much what you're doing.	0
By the way, the evangelicals of America voted 83% in the last election for you.	0
And I want you to know there are thousands and thousands of people praying for you all the time.	0
Thank you Pat, that's so nice.	0
Holding you up.	0
The evangelicals were so great to me.	0
And they did.	0
They came out in massive numbers.	0
And on top of that, I got 83%.	0
But they came out in record numbers.	0
They never came out like that.	0
And we've really helped.	0
Because I've gotten rid of the Johnson Amendment.	0
Now we're going to go try and get rid of it permanently in Congress.	0
But I signed an executive order so that now, people like you -- that I want to hear from -- ministers and preachers and rabbis and whoever it may be, they can speak.	0
Yeah.	0
You couldn't speak politically before.	0
Now you can.	0
And I want to hear from you and others that we like.	0
Franklin Graham -- I had such a -- Dr. Jeffress, Robert Jeffress, who is such a great guy.	0
Pastor Jeffress.	0
He used to go on television.	0
I didn't know who he was.	0
I'd see him.	0
And he was always speaking so well of me.	0
And you have so many people that I want to hear from.	0
Now they're going to be able to speak.	0
And that's going to be a great thing for Christianity.	0
Believe me -- a great, great thing.	0
And it's a great thing for religion.	0
One last thing.	0
It looks like you may have another Supreme Court nominee.	0
Very possible one or more will retire.	0
And have you already got the list ready for the next one?	0
Well we have a great one with Justice Gorsuch.	0
Unbelievable.	0
He's going to be great.	0
And I just have to wait to see what happens.	0
I have a lot of respect for Justice Kennedy.	0
I like him a lot.	0
But we have to see what happens.	0
And we'll be learning.	0
Whatever it is, it is.	0
If there is ever a vacancy, we will put somebody on who is going to be terrific for our country.	0
Last question.	0
There seems to be a visceral hatred of you in the part of the left.	0
And they won't quit.	0
Does it bother you?	0
Well, there's a -- there seems to be a hatred.	0
And it's too bad.	0
We're creating jobs.	0
We're creating value.	0
We're making our country proud again.	0
We're building up our military.	0
We're taking care of our police.	0
Our police have been horribly treated.	0
And the veterans, by the way, is being reformed dramatically.	0
The veterans.	0
We have something where it's accountability.	0
Veterans Accountability Act.	0
We have, where you could be the worst employee in history, you could treat the veterans horribly.	0
You can do whatever you want.	0
They couldn't fire you.	0
They've been trying to get rid of it for 40 years.	0
They've been trying to get in a position where they can do things.	0
I had it passed last week.	0
I just signed it last week.	0
Nobody even talks about it.	0
But you know what?	0
The people know that we're doing these things.	0
The people see the stock market.	0
The people see the jobs report.	0
But it is really unfair, because it's like a witch hunt.	0
It's like a witch hunt.	0
But we take it.	0
We take it.	0
As long as my people understand -- that's why I do interviews with you.	0
You have a tremendous audience.	0
You have people that I love -- the evangelicals.	0
And sometimes, you say the evangelical Christians.	0
But I do a lot of interviews with people, because I can get the word out.	0
Because I'm treated very unfairly by the press.	0
And it is what it is.	0
You don't mind if we ask you to take on heavyweights and not fight and with light weights anymore?	0
No, we want to fight.	0
The big guys.	0
We want to fight.	0
We have to bring our country back.	0
Yeah.	0
Our country was going in the wrong direction.	0
That's right.	0
You couldn't build.	0
You couldn't do anything.	0
Our country was going in the wrong direction.	0
And by the way, what they were doing to religious liberty.	0
They were destroying religious liberty.	0
You will be saying Merry Christmas again very soon.	0
We'll count on it.	0
Thank you.	0
Well, Mr. President, thank you so much for being with us.	0
Thank you.	0
Always a joy to see you.	0
Such a great honor.	0
We're so proud of what you're doing.	0
Thank you very much.	0
God bless you.	0
Look, he's a showboat.	0
He's a grandstander.	0
The FBI has been in turmoil.	0
You know that.	0
I know that.	0
Everybody knows that.	0
You take a look at the FBI a year ago, it was in virtual turmoil.	0
Less than a year ago.	0
It hasn't recovered from that.	0
Monday, you met with the Deputy Attorney General Rob Rosenstein.	0
Did you ask for a recommendation? What I did is, was I going to fire	0
[James]	0
Comey.	0
My decision.	0
It was not...	0
You had made the decision before they came over...	0
I...	0
I was going to fire Comey.	0
There is no good time to do it by the way.	0
They...	0
Because in your letter you said I...	0
I accepted...	0
I accepted their recommendation.	0
So, you had already made the decision.	0
Oh, I was going to fire regardless of recommendation. So there	0
[inaudible]	0
He made a recommendation He is highly respected.	0
Very good guy.	0
Very smart guy.	0
The Democrats like him.	0
The Republicans like him.	0
He made a recommendation, but regardless of recommendation I was going to fire Comey, knowing there was no good time to do it.	0
And in fact, when I decided to just do it I said to myself, I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.	0
It's an excuse by the Democrats having lost an election that they should have won.	0
And the reason they should have won it is, the electoral college is almost impossible for a Republican to win.	0
Very hard.	0
Because you start off at such a disadvantage.	0
So, everybody was thinking they should have won the election.	0
This was an excuse for having lost an election.	0
Are you angry with Mr. Comey because of his Russia investigation?	0
I just want somebody that's competent.	0
I am a big fan of the FBI.	0
I love the FBI.	0
I love the people of the FBI.	0
but when you have a land of people taking on that investigation I think that.	0
But were you a fan of him taking up that investigation?	0
I think that... about the Hillary Clinton investigation?	0
No, about the Russia investigation and possible links between...	0
No, I don't care... look, look, let me tell you.	0
As far as I'm concerned, I want that thing to be absolutely done properly.	0
When I did this now, I said I probably maybe, will confuse people.	0
Maybe I'll expand that, you know, I'll lengthen the time because... it should be over with, it should... in my opinion, it should have been over with a long time ago, because all it is, is an excuse, But, I said to myself I might even lengthen out the investigation, but I have to do the right thing for the American people.	0
He's the wrong man for that position.	0
[Break]	0
Let me ask you about your termination letter to Mr. Comey.	0
You write: I greatly appreciate you informing me on three separate occasions and I am not under investigation.	0
Why did you put that in there?	0
Because he told me that.	0
I mean, he told me...	0
He told you you weren't under investigation with regard to the Russia investigation?	0
Yeah, and I've heard that, I've heard that from others.	0
Was it in a phone call?	0
Did you meet face to face?	0
I had a dinner with him.	0
He wanted to have dinner, because he wanted to stay on.	0
We had a very nice dinner at the White House very early on.	0
He asked for that?	0
That dinner was arranged.	0
I think he asked for the dinner.	0
And he wanted to stay on as the FBI head.	0
And I said, I would, you know, consider will see what happens.	0
But we had a very nice dinner.	0
And at that time, he told me you are not under investigation, which I knew anyway.	0
That was one meeting.	0
What were the other two?	0
First of all, when you are under investigation, you're giving all sorts of documents and everything.	0
I knew I wasn't under... And I heard it was stated at the committee, at some committee level that I wasn't.	0
Number one.	0
So that didn't come directly from him.	0
Then during the phone call, he said it, and then doing another phone call he said it.	0
So, he said it once at dinner, and then he said it twice doing phone calls.	0
Did... did you call him?	0
In one case, I called him.	0
In one case, he called me.	0
And did you ask am I under under investigation?	0
I actually asked him, yes.	0
I said, if it's possible, would you let me know if I am under investigation?	0
He said you are not under investigation.	0
But he's... he's given sworn testimony that there is an ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign, and possible collusion with the Russian government.	0
You were the centerpiece of the Trump campaign.	0
Is he being truthful when he says you're not under investigation?	0
Well, all I can tell you is... all, well, I know..	0
I know that I'm not under investigation, me personally.	0
I'm not talking about campaigns.	0
I'm not talking about anything else.	0
I'm not under investigation	0
Did you ask him to drop the investigation?	0
No, never.	0
Did anyone from the White House...	0
No, in fact I want the investigation speeded up.	0
Did anyone from the White House ask him to end the investigation?	0
No, no, why would we do that?	0
Any surrogates on behalf of the White House?	0
Not that I know of.	0
Look, I want to find out if there was a problem with an election having to do with Russia, or by the way any, but... anybody else.	0
Any other country.	0
And, I want that to be so strong and so good.	0
And, I want it to happen.	0
I also want to have a really competent, capable director.	0
He's not.	0
He's a showboater.	0
He's not my man, or not my man, and I didn't appoint him.	0
He was appointed long before me.	0
But I want somebody who's going to do a great job, and I will tell you, we're looking at candidates right now who could be spectacular and that's what I want for the FBI.	0
What you said a moment ago about supporting the idea of investigation a lot of people would find it hard to believe that the man who just said that tweeted very recently it's a total hoax.	0
It's a taxpayer charade.	0
Oh, I think that looking into me and, the campaign...look, I have nothing to do.	0
This was set up by the Democrats.	0
There is no collusion between me and my campaign and the Russians.	0
The other thing is the Russians did not affect the vote.	0
And everybody seems to think that.	0
There is an investigation under way though, an FBI investigation.	0
Is that a charade?	0
Well, I don't know if it's an FBI, or if it's, there's so many investigations.	0
I don't know if it's an FBI investigation or if it's a Congress, if it's the Senate, or the House...	0
Well, James Comey testified there was an an FBI investigation.	0
Yeah, but I think they're also helping the House and the Senate.	0
So, you probably have FB.. FBI, but you have House, you have Senate.	0
They have other investigations.	0
But when you put out tweets it's a total hoax, it's a taxpayer charade, and you're looking for a new FBI director, are you not sending that person a message to lay off?	0
No.	0
I'm not doing that.	0
I think that we have to get back to work, but I want to find out...	0
I want to get to the bottom.	0
If Russia hacked, if Russia did anything having to do with our election,	0
Well, there's already, already intelligence from virtually every intelligence agency that yes, that happened.	0
I'll tell you this.	0
If Russia or anybody else is trying to interfere with our elections, I think it's a horrible thing, and I want to get to the bottom of it, and I want to make sure it will never ever happen.	0
Were angry with James Comey when he went public and said he can't support your unsubstantiated charges of wire tapping... that your your predecessor wiretapped you?	0
I was surprised he said it but I wasn't angry.	0
There's a big thing going on right now which is spying, and it's.... you can call it anything you want.	0
The, the unmasking, and the spying, and to me, that's the big story right now.	0
That's a very very big story.	0
You didn't take that as a sign of disloyalty that came out and contradicted you?	0
No, I didn't...	0
I didn't.	0
I don't think of it is loyalty.	0
I mean, I want, whoever the director is, I want them to do the right thing.	0
And what about when he went public and said that there was in fact an FBI investigation looking at your campaign and Russia.	0
Did that anger you?	0
I ask that because there's... there is a sense that there was a building anger here.	0
Well, you know, I have that.	0
I have that.	0
No, no, no.	0
I..	0
I know, every once in a while you'll see that in the newspaper, anger, somebody will report, or they'll have fall sources that maybe don't exist, because of the media, the way the media is.	0
No, I will tell you I think that, um, I want, very simply a great FBI director.	0
And we expect that they would would continue on with this investigation?	0
Oh yeah sure, I expect that.	0
General Flynn is a part of his investigation.	0
You know, Sally Yates recently testified that the White House was notified that he had been compromised, he was at risk of being blackmailed.	0
It was eighteen days later that he was finally fired.	0
During that eighteen days he had access, I assume, to all the nation's top secrets.	0
One day, you meet on the issue of Comey...	0
Right.	0
...and you fire in a humiliating way while he's sitting in a room with his colleagues and it's appearing on the TV.	0
Cause my White House Counsel Don McGahn, came back to me, and did not sound like an emergency of any... it didn't make it sound like he was, you know... and she actually didn't make it sound that way either, in the hearings the other day, like it had to be done immediately.	0
This man has served for many years.	0
He's a general.	0
He's a, in my opinion, a very good person.	0
I believe that it would be very unfair to hear from somebody who we don't even know and immediately run out and fire a general.	0
Now...	0
She was the acting Attorney General at the time.	0
Uh, my White House counsel came to me.	0
They had, I believe two meetings.	0
And we ultimately fired, but was fired for a different reason.	0
You're talking about General Flynn.	0
General Flynn, yes.	0
Because of, because of lying to the Vice President.	0
Yeah, but everything plays in.	0
Everything plays into it.	0
But we fired him because he said something to the vice president that was not so.	0
Did you know that he had had that received payments from the Russian government, that he had received payments from the Turkish government?	0
No, no but Obama perhaps knew because he had clearance from the Obama administration.	1
And his clearance... and, and this is something they never want to report.	0
He had clearance from the Obama administration, the highest clearance you can have.	0
And, I think it's a very unfair thing that the media doesn't talk about that.	0
You know you're talking about 2015.	0
I don't know that I knew him in 2015.	0
The Senate intelligence committee wants, wants info... information from the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Unit about your finances, your business' finances.	0
Yeah.	0
Can you tell us whether you, your family, your business is... your surrogates have accepted any investments, any loans from Russian individual or institutions?	0
Yeah, in fact I just sent a letter sent to Lindsey Graham from one of the most prestigious law firms.	0
in the country, a tremendous, highly-rated law firm that I have nothing to do with Russia.	0
I have no investments in Russia.	0
None whatsoever.	0
I don't have property in Russia.	0
A lot of people thought I owned office buildings in Moscow.	0
I don't have property in Russia.	0
And I am in very...	0
I'm, I mean...	0
I'm in total compliance in every way.	0
Now I have to tell you, I file documents, hundreds of pages worth of documents, with the Federal Elections Bureau.	0
Everybody's seen that.	0
I built a great company.	0
But I'm not involved with Russia.	0
I have had dealings over the years where I sold a house to a very wealthy Russian, many years ago.	0
I had the Miss Universe pageant, which I owned for quite a while, I had it in Moscow, long time ago.	0
But other than that, I have nothing to do with Russia.	0
And one last a question on this matter, did you ever...	0
And I have a certified letter, just so you understand.	0
It...	0
I'm not just saying that.	0
I've given the letter.	0
I've given a letter to Senator Lindsey Graham.	0
He has the letter, and I think frankly...	0
I assume he's going to give the letter out.	0
But it says, I am not involved in Russia.	0
No loans.	0
No nothing.	0
Did you worry at all when you made the decision to fire Comey when you did, the day before Lavrov was here in the White House, and the Russian ambassador.	0
Did you think through the optics of the way this would look?	0
I never thought about.	0
It was set up a while ago.	0
And frankly I could have waited but, what difference does it make?	0
I'm not looking for cosmetics.	0
I'm looking to do a great job for the country.	0
I'm looking to create jobs.	0
I'm looking to create strength and security.	0
I'm looking to have strong borders.	0
I'm looking for things like that.	0
I think it's really a good thing that I meet with people.	0
Now, this is a public meeting, because you know, when you cover this, the people watching may say, oh he met with Lavrov.	0
Well, this was announced that I'm meeting with Lavrov, just like the number of days ago I spoke... had a very good conversation, very public in the sense that everybody knew this was taking place.	0
I meet, I...	0
I talk all the time.	0
I just spoke, with the head of, the new head of South Korea, who just got elected.	0
I speak with the head of India.	0
I speak with the head of China.	0
I have to speak with Putin also.	0
It's called Russia.	0
But when I spoke with Putin, he asked me whether or not I would see Lavrov.	0
Now what, should show I say, no I'm not going to see him?	0
I said I will see him.	0
During that discussion with Lavrov, I think we had a great discussion having to do with Syria, having to do with the Ukraine, and maybe that discussion will lead to a lot less people getting killed, and will lead ultimately to peace, so I'm...	0
I'm okay with those discussions Lester, I think it's a good thing, not a bad thing.	0
You've got some excitement out on your lawn today.	0
Hello, Mr. President.	0
A little excitement.	0
What brings you here?	0
Are we on already?	0
We're on.	0
We're live.	0
Wow, wow.	0
That's good.	0
We're actually -- we're on every channel.	0
We had a very exciting trip over here, I have to say.	0
No kidding.	0
I was good.	0
It was good.	0
How are you?	0
I'm doing OK.	0
I was here for the baseball game.	0
How about Steve Scalise last night?	0
I think he's great.	0
How about that play?	0
The first play of the game.	0
Unbelievable.	0
He's a great guy.	0
Courageous.	0
He couldn't...	0
Courageous.	0
Right.	0
Like you.	0
Yes, sure.	0
Having you stop by live.	0
I got some questions.	0
I was mugged by the media.	0
They've got questions for you.	0
I'm hoping I can ask a lot of the questions.	0
They've got...	0
Very nice people.	0
You know, the I.G.	0
report came out yesterday.	0
The FBI looked bad.	0
Very bad.	0
Your FBI.	0
Well, no.	0
It was Comey having to do -- talking about Comey, not my FBI.	0
It was Comey.	0
The people in the FBI are incredible.	0
I would bet if you took a poll in the FBI, I would win that poll by more than anybody's ever won a poll.	0
But the top people were horrible.	0
You look at what happened: They were plotting against my election.	0
Probably has never happened like that in terms of intelligence, in terms of anything else.	0
But they were actually plotting against my election.	0
The headline right now...	0
I'm actually proud, because I beat the Clinton dynasty...	0
Right.	0
...I beat Bush dynasty, and now I guess hopefully I'm in the process of beating very dishonest intelligence.	0
Because what they did was incredible and a real insult to millions of people that voted in that election on both sides.	0
"The headline right now from the Wall Street Journal, ""DOJ Clinton Report Blasts Comey And Agents But Finds No Bias In Conclusion."""	0
Well, the end result was wrong.	0
I mean, there was total bias.	0
I mean, when you look at Peter Strzok and what he said about me, when you look at Comey all his moves.	0
So I guess -- you know it's interesting it was a pretty good report, and then I say that the I.G.	0
blew it at the very end with that statement, because when you read the report it was almost like Comey.	0
"He goes point after point about how guilty Hillary is and then he said, ""But we're not going to do anything about it."""	0
The report -- the I.G.	0
report was a horror show.	0
I thought that one sentence of conclusion was ridiculous.	0
"What about, apparently, the love birds talking about you, ""We will stop it""?"	0
Yeah, they said they will stop me.	0
While in the meantime the economy hit an all-time high this morning.	0
Never been better.	0
Jobless rate the lowest -- the best in 44 years, just came out.	0
We're going to have some incredible things.	0
We're just announcing very big tariffs today on China because China has been -- look he's my friend, President Xi.	0
He's a great man.	0
He's a wonderful guy.	0
But at some point we have to straighten it out.	0
We lost $500 billion in trade deficits last year.	0
We can't do that.	0
Is the new tariff something like 25 percent on...	0
It's being announced right now as I speak.	0
OK. You can announce it.	0
Maybe you have the first announcement.	0
You may...	0
What do you know about your tariffs?	0
You might beat the Wall Street Journal, all right.	0
You just beat the Wall Street Journal by a lot.	0
Well, we're just going to do $50 billion on $50 billion of high-technology equipment and other things coming into the country, because so much of our secrets -- you know, we have the great brain power in Silicon Valley, and China and others steal those secrets.	0
And we're going protect those secrets.	0
Those are crown jewels for this country.	0
And, you know, you read so much about China, you read so much about other countries, we have the great brainpower right in this country, I'm proud to say.	0
And you're certainly a member of that group.	0
I'm an America.	0
"What about the fact that there are a lot of people that say, ""What's he doing?"	0
He's going to start a trade war?	0
"If he slaps 25 percent on $50 billion for China that's going to be bad for Americans""?"	0
No, the trade war was started many years ago by them and the United States lost.	0
There's no trade war...	0
So you're saying we're on the losing end of it?	0
Well, no.	0
There is no trade war.	0
They've taken so much.	0
So last year $375 billion in trade deficit.	0
We had a 300 -- with China.	0
We had overall over $800 billion over a period of years -- each year close to $800 billion in losses on trade.	0
Not going to happen anymore.	0
It's not going to happen.	0
Can't happen.	0
A week ago you were up in -- up in Canada and you met with the G-7 people.	0
I was.	0
That didn't end so well.	0
Oh, it ended well.	0
For the United States, it ended well.	0
Well, the world community thinks the United States is turning our back on them.	0
No, no.	0
But your opinion is that it's you got elected to represent America and America needs help.	0
We need protection.	0
Everybody's taking advantage of us.	0
The European Union made $151 billion on us last year.	0
The -- if you look at -- I told you about China.	0
You look at Japan, you look at South Korea, you look at so many -- and we help these countries militarily on top of everything else.	0
I mean, you know, at what point does it stop?	0
And when I left China, it was absolutely a fantastic meeting.	0
We left, we hugged, we kissed.	0
Everybody was leaving, and then I get onto Air Force One and the prime minister up there, Trudeau, didn't think, I guess, that we have any televisions on Air Force One.	0
But they have, I think, 21 televisions or some ridiculous number...	0
And so, you saw it and you hit the roof.	0
Well, you have to understand, we're hugging, we're saying goodbye, everybody's happy.	0
I made changes to the agreement because I wanted it to be much better for the United States.	0
I made changes.	0
We're all happy.	0
And then he got up and started saying that he doesn't want to be pushed around by the United States.	0
Well, they charge us almost 300 percent on dairy products.	0
Right.	0
So, we can't do that.	0
Have you heard from any of the G-7...	0
Yeah.	0
They all called me to wish me happy birthday yesterday.	0
Really?	0
And how was that?	0
It was very...	0
Not your birthday, but the message from the other side.	0
I took it very well.	0
Right.	0
No, they all called.	0
I mean, I have great friendships.	0
The new prime minister of Italy is great.	0
Got to meet him.	0
Very -- very strong on immigration...	0
Right.	0
...like I am, by the way.	0
It seems that strong on immigration wins now.	0
Sure.	0
But this is...	0
But the Democrats, by the way, are very weak on immigration.	0
If you notice when I came over, they were all saying about separating the families and that's a Democrat bill.	0
That's Democrats wanting to do that, and they could solve it very easily by getting together.	0
But they think it's a good election point.	0
I think it's a horrible election point for them.	0
Ultimately Congress has got to change the laws...	0
They got to change the law.	0
"...but at the same time, Mr. President, people say, ""Look, you rip these families apart."	1
"Even though it is the law, it's heartless."""	0
But that's the law.	0
And that's what the Democrats gave us.	1
And we're willing to change it today if they want to get in and negotiate, but the just don't want to negotiate.	1
They're afraid of -- they're afraid of security for our country.	0
They're afraid of a wall.	0
Although I must tell you, most people now really -- they want the wall, they want to stop the drugs, they want to stop a lot of people from coming in that shouldn't be here, like MS-13.	0
Right.	0
A lot of -- I was up on Capitol Hill yesterday with Steve Scalise.	0
They were having a leadership meeting.	0
It sounds like they were going to take a vote on a couple of different bills on immigration probably next week.	0
Yeah.	0
One of them the Goodlatte bill, the other is something more moderate.	0
Would you sign either one of those?	0
I'm looking at both of them.	0
I certainly wouldn't sign the more moderate one.	0
What does the bill have to have in it?	0
I -- I need a bill that gives this country tremendous border security.	0
I have to have that.	0
We have to get rid of catch-and-release.	0
Got to have the wall?	0
Does that mean the wall?	0
We have to have the wall.	0
If we don't have the wall, there's no bill.	0
We have to have catch-and-release.	0
We catch a criminal, a real criminal, a rough tough criminal, we take his name and then we release him.	0
"And we say, ""Please show up to court in a couple of months."""	0
You know what the chances of getting him to court are?	0
Like zero.	0
OK.	0
It's crazy.	0
Then we have the lottery program, right?	0
It's called lotter-visery.	0
Diversity Lottery Program.	0
Yes, well, the lottery visa.	0
OK. One of the...	0
OK, whatever.	0
They have fifty names.	0
Still -- everyone of them has lottery.	0
Do you know what lottery is?	0
That's when you pick names to come into the country.	0
Well, when a country gives names, they're not giving us their finest.	0
So we're picking people, it's not good.	0
We have to end that.	0
We have to end a couple of them and we are going to be so secure as a country.	0
Now, with all of that being said, we're doing a great job.	0
ICE -- we're getting MS-13 out by the thousands.	0
But we shouldn't have to be going into towns in Long Island and other places and getting them out.	0
You know, it's almost like we're liberating towns.	0
It's incredible.	0
You mentioned court.	0
Regarding a legal proceeding, you got Robert -- the -- the Mueller investigation.	0
I know we, kind of, touched on that a little while ago.	0
Rudy Giuliani is out this morning.	0
He said the investigation should go away.	0
Time to fold up the tent.	0
Or it's time to investigate the investigators.	0
Are you on the same page...	0
Look, we have 13 angry Democrats.	1
There are -- I call them 13 angry Democrats, and others worked for Obama for eight years.	1
I mean, they have no Republicans, you have no -- it's a very unfair situation.	1
But the I.G.	0
"report totally exonerates -- I mean, if you look at the results and if you look at the head investigator is saying, ""We have to stop Trump from becoming president,"" well, Trump became president and we have the best economy today we've ever had."	0
Right.	0
We have much greater border security than we ever would have had.	0
Right.	0
And when we do it -- when we have the laws changed, it'll be like perfecto.	0
Rudy says that you should not talk to a lawyer.	0
A lot of people say that.	0
Look...	0
Getting the I.G.	0
report and stuff that's going on.	0
They're getting people who say something a little bit off.	0
Is it a nice day?	0
Well, you know, no, it's not a great day.	0
Oops, you lied.	0
He goes -- you know, got problems.	0
What...	0
People are afraid of that.	0
And I would like to talk, but it seems to be very biased.	0
One of -- some of the texts -- and we're not going to quote them -- were very...	0
Vicious.	0
...vicious regarding people who support you.	0
Vicious.	0
I have the greatest supporters in the world.	0
By the way, they're the smartest.	0
They're the hardest working.	0
They pay taxes.	0
They're incredible.	0
They're loyal.	0
I have the bikers.	0
I have the -- the construction workers.	0
Right.	0
I have them all.	0
I have -- by the way, I have the FBI.	0
You go into the FBI and take a poll of the real FBI, not the scum on top, not Comey and that group of people that are total thieves...	0
Most of those are gone.	0
Well, I don't know how Peter Strzok is still working there, to be honest with you, OK.	0
He's working in H.R.	0
This is...	0
That's even worse.	0
Mr. President, this is your FBI.	0
I know.	0
But do you know what I've done?	0
And you know this.	0
I've told you this.	0
I'm so involved.	0
Great new secretary of state.	0
Right.	0
Just -- I have a fantastic relationship now with North Korea.	0
You know, there were missiles being thrown about.	0
Yeah.	0
People aren't thinking about it anymore.	0
I said on the Department of Justice, I would stay uninvolved.	0
Now, I may get involved at some point if it gets worse.	0
I say I'm staying uninvolved.	0
I'm letting this report go through.	0
I did nothing wrong.	0
There was no collusion.	0
There was no obstruction.	0
There was no one...	0
But, Mr. President, I was on Capitol Hill yesterday, and there are a number of congressional Republicans who are -- you know, they're trying to get some documents from your Department of Justice, your FBI.	0
I tried to stay involved.	0
I may not stay involved, again -- uninvolved.	0
Because they have to get the documents.	0
Look, I think everybody...	0
But your FBI is stonewalling.	0
I think that Road -- Rog...	0
Rosenstein.	0
...Rosenstein thinks that you have to get the documents.	0
I really believe that.	0
I saw him yesterday.	0
He gave me a briefing.	0
It think that he believes you have to get the documents.	0
What did he say regarding the I.G.	0
report?	0
Well, he wasn't thrilled about it.	0
I mean, you know, you can't be if you're in there now.	0
But it really was talking about the past.	0
It's not talking about us.	0
It's talking about before us.	0
And it's talking about the election.	0
What they did during the election was a disgrace.	0
It's probably never happened in our country before.	0
And that's just the tip of the iceberg.	0
What's going to happen when we go further?	0
And there was total bias.	0
I mean, total bias.	0
From what you've seen so far, should James Comey be locked up?	0
Well, look, I would never want to get involved in that.	0
Certainly he -- they just seem like very criminal acts to me.	0
What he did was criminal.	0
What he did was a terrible thing to people.	0
What he did was so bad in terms of our Constitution, in terms of the well-being of our country.	0
What he did was horrible.	0
Should he be locked up?	0
Let somebody make a determination.	0
Look at all the dishonest things that crooked Hillary did.	0
Look at -- look at what -- what's gone on.	0
It's very sad.	0
Sounds like he was using a private e-mail, too.	0
He had a private e-mail.	0
That was -- of all the things, that wasn't to me maybe the most interesting, but it was probably the funniest.	0
Because she got in big trouble for her private e-mail.	0
Oh, James Comey's using one, too.	0
That was a little bit of a surprise, I have to say.	0
Yeah.	0
From what we've seen, though, regarding the I.G.	0
report, it -- it sounds like Comey made some bad judgments but nothing criminal.	0
Well, if you look at what happened -- and don't forget all of these people like Strzok, what he did was criminal, Strzok and so many others.	0
McCabe is now...	0
Do you mean biased the analysts?	0
Oh, they all work for Comey.	0
And Comey knew everything that was going on.	0
You think McCabe didn't tell him everything?	0
McCabe told him everything, and McCabe is up for criminal right now.	0
And most people...	0
And now he's suing the Department of Justice.	0
And he's now suing.	0
And it's a total mess.	0
They're all going against each other.	0
No, I -- I think Comey was the ringleader of this whole, you know, den of thieves.	0
It was a den of thieves.	0
Are you confident that, either through the congressional investigators or the I.G.	0
report or new management at the -- at the FBI, things are going to work out..	0
I think so.	0
I think so.	0
...things are cleaning up and we'll get to the bottom of all that stuff?	0
I do believe so.	0
I think its happening.	0
It's happening slowly, but it's happening.	0
I think Christopher Wray's a -- very different from Comey.	0
Which is what you need, you need different.	0
You need, like, the opposite.	0
And he's moving step by step.	0
And you're going to see a whole new, very proud FBI.	0
I think that the Justice Department will end up being great.	0
It's all going to happen.	0
It's all going to work out.	0
But I tried to stay as much uninvolved as I can.	0
You were very involved in going to Singapore, negotiating with Kim Jong-un.	0
Right.	0
When you finally met him and sat across the table from -- you know, we've heard a lot of bad things about little rocket man.	0
And suddenly you guys seem to be best friends.	0
We got along very well.	0
We had a good chemistry.	0
I don't know if that's supposed to be popular or politically correct to say.	0
But we really did.	0
We had good chemistry.	0
You haven't had any rockets shot up in the air for seven months.	0
You haven't had any research.	0
They just blew up their test site.	0
They're blowing up their engine test site for ballistic missiles.	0
He's giving us back our great heroes who died, as you know.	0
Right.	0
We're getting their remains back.	0
"And I've had so many people, so many parents, so many fathers and daughters and sons asking me, ""Please, please."""	0
Right.	0
This is during the campaign and after.	0
I say, I don't have exactly a good relationship.	0
Anyway, during the meeting -- and we really did hit it off.	0
During the -- you know, good chemistry.	0
You -- you have since used some very friendly words regarding him.	0
And you're taking some heat for that.	0
Yes.	0
I mean, that's what it is.	0
I take heat.	0
"But what am supposed to do, walk out and say ""terrible""?"	0
I mean, I -- I got along with him very well.	0
We have good chemistry.	0
"I asked him, ""The remains; I'd like to get them."""	0
Right	0
"He said, ""Yes, we will do that."""	0
They are already starting to produce the remains of these great young soldiers who were left in North Korea.	0
Right.	0
We're getting the remains, and nobody thought that was possible.	0
The way you have described things, it sounds like you feel that he's on the road to denuking.	0
Oh, absolutely.	0
It's in the agreement: It says he will denuclearize.	0
Right.	0
I know it's, kind of, broad...	0
You know, it's funny -- it's funny when you see the fake news, because -- and you guys aren't fake.	0
But I signed an agreement where we get everything.	0
Everything.	0
"But they say ""Trump lost because he agreed to meet."	0
"Trump agreed to meet."""	0
Got the picture.	0
No, it's a funny thing.	0
You got to watch CNN.	0
I mean, what -- what a fraud it is.	0
"They go, ""Trump is..."""	0
They're listening.	0
They're right behind you, right there.	0
That's fine.	0
Do you hear me?	0
Trump agreed to meet.	0
I say I agreed to meet.	0
Of course you got to agree to meet.	0
If you don't agree to meet, you know what you're going to have?	0
You're going to have nuclear war, that's what you're going to have.	0
I have a great relationship.	0
He gave us back our hostages.	0
I didn't pay $1.8 billion.	0
I paid nothing.	0
Right.	0
But it was very smart that he did it.	0
He gave us back our hostages.	0
He's giving us back the remains of probably 7,500 soldiers.	0
Really?	0
Yeah.	0
There's a tremendous number of soldiers.	0
Tremendous number of MIAs, you know, folks that just never -- they've never been found.	0
It sounds like...	0
And they -- and by the way, they know where many of these bodies are.	0
What -- what is the stage of the meetings now?	0
I know, you know...	0
It's great.	0
Mike Pompeo is just leaving there.	0
He was in South Korea. Any developments	0
[Inaudible]	0
?	0
We're getting along great with South Korea.	1
We're getting along great with China.	0
Probably until this morning, because we just did a tariff in China.	0
But that's OK, because I have a wonderful relationship with President Xi.	0
We'll all work it out.	0
He understands it's unfair.	0
Right.	0
They can't believe they got away with it for so long, Steve.	0
Right.	0
They can't believe it.	0
I mean, they got away with it for 25 years.	0
I'm not just blaming Obama.	0
I'm blaming many presidents and leaders.	0
At what point...	0
It should have never happened.	0
At what point do the sanctions come off of North Korea?	0
When we can be sure there will be no more nuclear.	0
How close are we to that?	0
Very close.	0
We're very close to getting it started.	0
He wants to do it.	0
He wants to do something great with his country.	0
He wants to make his country great.	0
So, you are saying that you'll relieve the sanctions once whatever he's going to do...	0
Once we know...	0
...is completely -- that stuff doesn't work anymore.	0
Once we know that it can't happen.	0
Right.	0
And I'm telling you right now, with the relationship I have, it's not going to happen.	0
Hey, you haven't had a rocket test in seven months.	0
Right.	0
I was with Prime Minister Abe, another good friend of mine from Japan.	0
"I said, ""When's the last time you had a rocket flying over Japan?"""	0
"He said, ""It has not happened."""	0
"I said, ""It won't happen."	0
"Don't worry about."""	0
Right.	0
Are we close to seeing Mr. Kim here at the White House?	0
It could happen.	0
I mean, yeah, I would have him. Did they talk about that...	0
[Crosstalk]	0
Yeah.	0
I think it's something that could happen.	0
Yeah.	0
Hey, he's the head of a country.	0
And I mean he is the strong head.	0
Don't let anyone think anything different.	0
Right.	0
He speaks and his people sit up at attention.	0
I want my people to do the same.	0
Well, just before you met with him, he cleaned house.	0
Three of his top generals, some of the hardliners he fired.	0
Yeah, that's what I hear.	0
Then you go over there.	0
And you got -- you took some heat over saluting one of the generals.	0
I think he fired at least, OK, when you say he fired.	0
Three that we know of.	0
I think maybe fired at least.	0
Fired may be a nice word.	0
That's right, I met a general.	0
He saluted me, I saluted him back.	0
And I guess their using that as another sound bite.	0
I mean, you know, I think I'm being respectful to the general.	0
We are -- we have a very good relationship with North Korea.	0
Right.	0
When I was talking to President Obama, he essentially was ready to go to war with North Korea.	0
He felt you had to almost go to war.	0
"And I did ask him: ""Have you spoken to him?"""	0
"He goes, ""No."""	0
"I said, ""Do you think it would be a good thing to speak to him maybe?"""	0
Right.	0
OK. Because if you go to war there, you're not talking about 100,000 lives, which is a lot.	0
Right.	0
You're talking about 30, 40, 50 million lives.	0
Sure.	0
Seoul is 30 miles off the border.	0
They don't even need nuclear weapons to take out Seoul.	0
They have thousands of cannons -- they call them cannons; they have big guns -- thousands pointed right at Seoul.	0
We have a really great relationship for the first time ever.	0
No president's ever had this.	0
So I get hit by these fakes back here.	0
Not all of them.	0
Some are phenomenal.	0
But I get hit, because I went there, I gave him credibility.	0
I think it's great to give him credibility.	0
Here's what we got: everything, point after point after point.	0
One point, I think it was in the last week, 10 days, things are going faster in Washington, just saying.	0
But...	0
We're having a lot of fun, right?	0
So supposing Hillary got elected instead of Trump, do you think it would be so exciting?	0
Your ratings would be way down.	0
Number one show in the morning, folks.	0
Well, thank you.	0
I've heard you say the others -- in cable news.	0
That's right.	0
It was within the last...	0
Actually also beyond cable news you're doing pretty well.	0
We're doing OK.	0
Thanks for dropping by...	0
I like ratings. All the others	0
[Inaudible]	0
.	0
I study ratings, broadcasting.	0
You had mentioned the NFL players and the -- you know, some taking a knee.	0
And you would like to hear some of the stories of people who you should pardon.	0
And you mentioned professional athletes.	0
Have you heard from any of them?	0
No.	0
I haven't heard.	0
"You know, they were all saying, ""Oh, it has nothing to do with the flag."	0
"It's the way we've been treated,"" and in the meantime they're making $15 million a year."	0
Look, I'm all for the athletes.	0
I think it's great.	0
I love athletics.	0
I love sports.	0
But they shouldn't get the politics involved.	0
When you're in a stadium and they broadcast that national anthem, you got to stand, and you got to be proud, and you got to have your hand up, and you got to do everything that's right.	0
And then go out and play really tough football.	0
And once you leave that stadium, go and do whatever you want to do.	0
Run for office, or do whatever.	0
But I did say, you know, I have this tremendous power of pardon.	0
And Kim Kardashian came in, and the woman 22 years in jail	0
People can't believe that you would be listening to Kim Kardashian.	0
Oh, I did.	0
I don't know her, and I met her and she was really nice, I have to say, and very capable.	0
"But she came in and she said, ""This is a very unfair situation."""	0
I looked at her and I agreed.	0
Twenty -- she's in there for 22 years, she's got another 20 years to serve, and you have drug dealers that are doing big stuff and they get a two-month sentence, OK. You know, it was just unfair.	0
And I thought it was a beautiful scene when that woman left prison and ran over to -- it looked like her grandkids, it was a couple of big strong guys.	0
[Inaudible]	0
.	0
Big strong guys, some wonderful women.	0
They were all hugging and kissing and everyone's crying.	0
To me that was a beautiful scene.	0
Well, she thanked me but, you know, thanked Kim, because I wouldn't have known about it.	0
Yeah.	0
"And I told the NFL players, I mean, indirectly -- I said, ""You have somebody that's aggrieved"" -- because they're saying people are aggrieved, OK. ""Let me know about it."	0
I'll look at it.	0
"If they're aggrieved, I will pardon them, I'll get them out."""	0
I'm shocked you haven't heard from a single one.	0
I don't think I've from one.	0
Now, maybe they've called the staff, but I have not personally heard from one.	0
Yeah.	0
Speaking of the staff...	0
Because I don't know if it's a real issue.	0
I don't think it's a real issue.	0
Sarah Huckabee Sanders, your press secretary, she's -- she took a lot of heat yesterday from the people behind you.	0
Oh, she did?	0
I didn't know that.	0
Well, she did.	0
There was some suggestion that maybe she'd be leaving the White House.	0
I don't think so.	0
You know, look at a certain point everyone, sort of, leaves.	0
You have to leave.	0
I'm, sort of, just standing -- I'm like a ship, just keep going, bing, bing.	0
But Sarah loves this job and she's announced -- not with me, I read that same report.	0
Somebody put it out, I think it was CBS -- when she said it's a false report.	0
But it's fake news.	0
But at some point I'm sure she'll leave, like everybody leaves and we'll get somebody else.	0
But Sarah's done a fantastic job.	0
No, I don't think she's leaving.	0
What do you make of the...	0
In fact, she was very insulted that they came out and said that.	0
Right.	0
So I don't think she's leaving.	0
What do you make of the back-and-forth between her and the press?	0
Because sometimes it gets loud.	0
Well, I think the press -- I think the press treats Sarah very unfairly.	0
That White House correspondent... But I think some of them feel she's not answering their questions, so they're going to ask it again and ask	0
[Inaudible]	0
.	0
Well, I gave a press conference in Singapore that was like an hour and a half, and that was like the biggest press group I've ever seen.	0
And I answered every single question.	0
I'd answer anybody's question.	0
I guess that's not supposed to be my job.	0
I'm here with you today, you're giving me a lot of...	0
Well, thank you very much.	0
...lot of interesting questions.	0
But -- but, Steve, I think Sarah is really a good person and a nice person, very capable.	0
She's got a lot of the father's genes, because her father is great.	0
Mike.	0
OK.	0
"Don't forget he got up there on that debate stage and he said, ""Nobody's going to beat Trump."""	0
And I even decided to -- he was running.	0
And I even decided to wear a Trump tie.	0
"And I said, ""I love that guy."""	0
I loved him, OK. Mike, is a very talented guy and Sarah's a very talented person.	0
But they treat her very badly.	0
What they did Sarah at the White House Correspondents -- now, the only difference I would have done, I would have walked out.	0
I thought she should have walked out instead of sitting there.	0
But, you know...	0
She took a high road.	0
She took a very high road.	0
Sometimes...	0
Yeah.	0
...you don't take such a high road.	0
We had Stewart Varney on our air...	0
By the way, he is great.	0
I love Stewart.	0
That little part, he's going to be running every day now.	0
No, I love him.	0
And he's right.	0
He knows what he's talking about.	0
Well, he suggested that the next quarter GDP could be 4 percent.	0
Well, they're predicting -- you know, the Atlanta Fed predicted 4.8 percent.	0
I think, you know, that's a lot.	0
Don't forget, then I got elected, I took this thing over, it was 1.2 and each point is $3 trillion and 10 million jobs.	0
"You know, a point -- people will say at home, ""Oh, it's a point, what difference does it make?"""	0
Well, it was 1.2 and it was going down.	0
You probably saw this morning I put out, they would have raised your taxes instead of cut your taxes, and they were going to put on more regulations.	0
The last thing we need is regulations.	0
I actually think my regulation cutting had more of an impact on the economy than the tax cuts.	0
"When you were running, you said, ""For every regulation we enact, I will cut two."""	0
Right.	0
But you didn't cut two, you're cutting a much bigger number.	0
Right.	0
22, it turned out.	0
22.	0
And -- and by the way, you need regulation.	0
I want the cleanest water in the world, I want the cleanest air in the world, I want that air to be so perfect.	0
And our air now is better than it was two years ago, with all of the talk and the nonsense.	0
Clean -- crystal clean water, clean air.	0
But I also want our companies to be competitive so they can go around the world and compete.	0
And we were shutting down companies over the environment and they weren't doing anything wrong.	0
And that's jobs.	0
Right.	0
"But there are some who say, ""Look the EPA is relaxing a lot of rules that are out there to protect people."""	0
Only rules that don't mean anything or rules that are duplicative.	0
You know, rules where you have...	0
There's a lot of those.	0
Well, not only that, I mean, some of them you have nine different times you have to get the same thing approved by different agencies.	0
Right.	0
To build a highway in this country takes 19 years of approvals.	0
I have it down to two years.	0
And you'll get rejected if it's wrong, if it's environmentally bad.	0
Right.	0
But I have it down to two years.	0
I want to get it down to one year.	0
And that's indicative of everything else, too.	0
A company comes in from China, from Japan they want to spend a tremendous amount of money on building a plant or something, right?	0
It takes them seven years to get a permit, and they don't do it because it's too long.	0
Right.	0
I have it down to one year and even faster.	0
Now, if they're wrong, we know immediately.	0
Right.	0
You know, you don't have to wait seven years.	0
How about going through the process seven years and getting rejected?	0
How about a highway that spends 19 years getting approved and then in the last vote they get a three-to-two vote no?	0
Right.	0
That happens oftentimes and they spend hundreds of millions of dollars on the approval.	0
Not going to happen anymore.	0
I saw a headline on Drudge, I think this morning, unemployment at a 44-year low.	0
Yeah, yeah.	0
Drudge is great, by the way.	0
Matt Drudge is a great gentleman who -- who really -- I don't know, he's got an ability to capture the stories that people want to see.	0
But that was the number one story on Drudge.	0
Forty-four year low unemployment, and -- and I saw that in very big letters actually...	0
Right.	0
"...and I said ""That makes me very proud."""	0
Another story out there was -- this past week is, while you did meet with Kim Jong-un, it sounds like you and Mr. Putin may be sitting down sometime soon.	0
What -- what can you tell us about that?	0
We may.	0
"And -- and it started because a reporter shouted to me, ""Should Putin be in the G-7?"""	0
"I said, ""No, he should be in the G-8."""	0
It used to be the G-8 a few years ago, and I think President Obama didn't like him or -- even though they gave advance notice about the election to Obama...	0
Right.	0
...people forget about that.	0
You know, Obama was told by the CIA or somebody, FBI, about Russia.	0
He didn't do anything about it.	0
How come he never gets blamed?	0
Right.	0
In September, just before the election, my election, he should have done it, because maybe I would have won by more.	0
Right.	0
Yesterday, a big day.	0
Not only did the A.G. report come out, but it was your birthday.	0
That's right.	0
Get any good presents?	0
I got a lot of good kisses.	0
I got a lot of phone calls from people that I would never have gotten phone calls from.	0
I got phone calls from...	0
Who'd you get the kisses from?	0
From my beautiful wife...	0
OK.	0
...who's really doing great, she's doing great.	0
But -- and my kids.	0
Oh, speaking of your wife...	0
Yeah?	0
...you know, we saw a story -- I think as you were heading to the chopper you said, you know, she can't fly for a month.	0
One month.	0
"Well, the doctor said, ""Don't fly for a month,"" but she'll be able to very shortly."	0
Because she's on the mend?	0
Oh, she's in great shape.	0
She's like perfect.	0
Right.	0
"She -- somebody said, ""Did she have a face lift?"""	0
No.	0
Did she have this?	0
Did she have that?	0
I mean, the speculation, even after the doctors gave a full -- and these are White House doctors.	0
They give -- you know, they give really straight stuff.	0
But no, she's doing fantastically well.	0
We had your son Don Jr. on our show, and he said he was not getting you anything for your birthday because you've got everything.	0
Well, I just want to have a successful country.	0
I'll be honest, I -- this is so intensive.	0
We've done more -- I don't say this in a bragging way, actually some of the haters actually say this.	0
We've done more in 500 days -- so now it's 510 days -- than any 500-day president first term by far.	0
Yeah.	0
And that's what I want to do.	0
I want to really -- you know, I got elected to make America great again.	0
Very simple: Make America great again.	0
That's what we're doing.	0
And we are respected around the world.	0
You take a look at Iran, they're not talking about Iran taking over the Middle East.	0
I took that crazy deal that Obama gave them away.	0
Iran is not looking to the Mediterranean anymore.	0
You know, they had to go through a lot of territory to get there.	0
Right.	0
They're looking to survive.	0
But I will tell you, some day soon they're going to come back and they're going to want to negotiate a deal and we'll make a deal.	0
But they were nasty.	0
They were very, very nasty, and it had to be stopped.	0
I took away the deal, and I think they've been treating America with much more respect.	0
And I have to say that you don't see the little boats circling our boats anymore; do you notice that?	0
Remember with Obama, you had this beautiful destroyer, you had this Annapolis captain on the boat, and he's sitting there, and you could see he's like a boiler waiting to explode, because he was giving orders.	0
And they were circling us with those boats, right?	0
And he wanted to shoot the hell out of them...	0
Well, they were harassing -- trying to engage...	0
He wanted to -- they were harassing our -- our guys.	0
And he wanted to shoot the hell out of them.	0
Yeah.	0
And you don't see that stuff anymore.	0
By the way, when they captured our 10 sailors and made them get on their knees, you're not going to see that anymore.	0
I hear the bells in the distance.	0
We're coming up on 9 o'clock in the East.	0
How're you going to celebrate Father's Day?	0
Work.	0
I'm going to work.	0
I'm going to actually be calling North Korea.	0
I'm going to be calling...	0
What are you going to say to him?	0
I just had -- right now I have a call from your friend from France, Emmanuel.	0
What are you going to tell him?	0
"I'm going to tell him, ""You have to treat us better on trade."""	0
European Union's not treating us well on trade.	0
I love trade.	0
You know, trades always been my thing.	0
Even 20 years ago when I'd be talking to you, trade was always my thing.	0
It's probably -- I'm getting a lot of credit for what we're doing foreign, but I -- I think my best thing is going to be trade.	0
We have to straighten out our trade.	0
You know, we're doing well despite our bad trade deals.	0
After we do our trade deals, what 'til you see the numbers.	0
Right.	0
Mr. President, I don't think in the history -- anybody ever know of the sitting president come out on the North Lawn?	0
Never.	0
Never.	0
Never happened. Secret Service is thrilled...	0
[Laughter]	0
...as I -- as I stand here.	0
On the way...	0
Look at these guys they're ready to..	0
Yeah.	0
I feel very secure.	0
[Inaudible]	0
You know what?	0
He --	0
This is definitely your son.	0
By the way...	0
It's fine.	0
He's not...	0
...I looked at him -- I look at him, there's no question that's your son.	0
That's very kind of you.	0
All right, Mr. President, thank you very much.	0
Thank you.	0
The stage is set.	0
The field has been narrowed.	0
For one night only, the top 10 candidates are here.	0
Our Democratic primary debate starts right now.	0
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)	0
This is an ABC News special.	0
I will be a president for every American.	0
This is our moment.	0
We are in a struggle for the future of this country.	0
We fight for our country.	0
That's the nature of who we are.	0
Right now we can act.	0
We're in the midst of the greatest economic transformation.	0
We have overcome worse times and darker moments than this.	0
We will make the most of this moment that we have here together.	0
We are on a march together.	0
We're going to win by being bold.	0
We're going to win by being fearless.	0
Live from Texas Southern University in Houston, Texas, here now, chief anchor George Stephanopoulos.	0
Good evening, and welcome to Houston.	0
We are live from Texas Southern University for tonight's Democratic debate.	0
The top 10 candidates are here.	0
It's going to start right now.	0
And on the stage, you see them.	0
They have all met the criteria set by the Democratic National Committee.	0
At least 10 others have not met the threshold.	0
So, for the first time in this primary, a single debate in a single night with all the top candidates facing off.	0
It is a critical test for the candidates and their campaigns at a critical time for our country.	0
They're going to lay out their vision for the country, their records, their differences with President Trump and each other.	0
And we're going to do our best to bring you a lively, informative, and civil debate.	0
"I'm joined here tonight by my ABC colleague, ""World News Tonight"" anchor David Muir, our national correspondent, Linsey Davis, and Jorge Ramos from our partner network, Univision."	0
Jorge?	0
George, thank you very much.	0
We appreciate the opportunity to welcome Latinos across the country and to ask about Latinx issues during these challenging times.	0
(SPEAKING SPANISH)	0
Let me just give you a little translation here.	0
I'm telling Latinos that, despite the fact that we are facing difficult times, this is our country, too.	0
Linsey?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We are delighted to be on the beautiful campus of Texas Southern University, one of the largest historically black colleges and universities in the country.	0
And here in the Health and Physical Education Building tonight, we are joined by a live audience of 3,500 people, most invited by the Democratic National Committee, and, of course, some of the brightest minds of the student body here at TSU.	0
Go Tigers.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We can feel the energy in the room, can't we, Linsey?	0
The rules of this debate are very basic tonight and have been agreed to by all the campaigns in advance.	0
Candidates will have one minute, 15 seconds to answer a direct question and 45 seconds for a rebuttal or response as directed by one of the moderators.	0
Candidates will each see green and yellow lights -- there you see them right there -- indicating how much time they have remaining.	0
And when time is up, the light will turn red.	0
Candidates who interrupt will be subject to having their time reduced later on.	0
But this is democracy, the great American experiment, and the candidates are here tonight to make their case.	0
The podium placement was based on their current standings in nationally recognized polls with the leading candidates in the center.	0
All candidates have been told they can have one minute to make an opening statement.	0
And we're going to begin in reverse polling order with Secretary Julian Castro.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Good evening, y bienvenidos a Texas.	0
Welcome to Texas.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
It's great to be here at TSU, home of the Tigers.	0
You know, on January 20, 2021, at 12:01 p.m., we're going to have a Democratic president, a Democratic House, and a Democratic Senate.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
There will be life after Donald Trump.	0
But the truth is that our problems didn't start just with Donald Trump, and we won't solve them by embracing old ideas.	0
We need a bold vision: universal pre-K and universal health care, unleashing millions of new jobs in the clean energy economy, a tax system that rewards people who have to work for a living.	0
But first, we have to win.	0
And that means exciting a young, diverse coalition of Americans who are ready for a bold future.	0
That's what Kennedy did, it's what Carter did, it's what Clinton did, it's what Barack Obama did, and it's what I can do in this race.	0
Get back Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, Florida, Georgia, and Arizona, and finally turn Texas blue and say goodbye to Donald Trump.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Klobuchar?	0
Good evening, Texas Southern.	0
I believe that what unites us up here, the 10 of us, is much stronger than what divides us.	0
And I think that's true of our country, too.	0
Now, I may not be the loudest person up here, but I think we've already got that in the White House.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Houston, we have a problem.	0
This -- we have a guy there that is literally running our country like a game show.	0
He would rather lie than lead.	0
I think we need something different.	0
I am someone that tells the truth.	0
I don't make promises that I can't keep.	0
I have people's back.	0
And I believe that to win, you bring people with you and that is how you govern, as well.	0
So, you're going to hear a lot of ideas up here.	0
Some will be great.	0
But if you see that some of them seem a little off-track, I've got a better way.	0
If you feel stuck in the middle of the extremes in our politics and you are tired of the noise and the nonsense, you've got a home with me, because I don't want to be the president for half of America.	0
I want to be the president for all of America.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Congressman Beto O'Rourke?	0
It's an honor to be on this debate stage.	0
It is wonderful to be back in Texas, in Houston, back here at TSU.	0
On August 3rd, in El Paso, Texas, two things became crystal clear for me, and I think produced a turning point for this country.	0
The first is just how dangerous Donald Trump is, the cost and the consequence of his presidency.	0
A racism and violence that had long been a part of America was welcomed out into the open and directed to my hometown of El Paso, Texas, where 22 people were killed, dozens more grievously injured by a man carrying a weapon he should never have been able to buy in the first place, inspired to kill by our president.	0
The second is how insufficient our politics is to meet the threat that we have right now.	0
The bitterness, the pettiness, the smallness of the moment, the incentives to attack one another and try to make differences without distinctions, mountains out of mole hills, we have to be bigger.	0
We have to see clearly, we have to speak honestly, and we have to act decisively.	0
That's what I want to do for you as president of the United States.	0
Thank you.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Cory Booker?	0
It was over 20 years ago that I was a law student and moved to inner city Newark, New Jersey, to serve as a tenants rights lawyer to try to address the challenges in my community.	0
And I was sobered by them -- the gun violence, the sub-standard housing.	0
But it was my greatest mentor, a woman named Ms. Virginia Jones, who challenged me.	0
She said, boy, if all you see in this neighborhood is problems, that's all there's ever going to be.	0
But if you're stubborn and defiant and can put forth a vision that can unify people, then we can make transformative change.	0
She was a church woman that said, without vision, the people will perish.	0
Well, that's exactly what we did.	0
We created extraordinary unity in our community, and we did things that other people think -- thought was impossible.	0
That's the story of America.	0
At our best, we unify, we find common cause and common purpose.	0
The differences amongst us Democrats on the stage are not as great as the urgency for us to unite as a party, not just to beat Donald Trump, but to unite America in common cause and common purpose.	0
That's why I'm running for president, and that's how I will lead this nation.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Entrepreneur Andrew Yang?	0
In America today, everything revolves around the almighty dollar -- our schools, our hospitals, our media, even our government.	0
It's why we don't trust our institutions anymore.	0
We have to get our country working for us again, instead of the other way around.	0
We have to see ourselves as the owners and shareholders of this democracy rather than inputs into a giant machine.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
When you donate money to a presidential campaign, what happens?	0
The politician spends the money on TV ads and consultants and you hope it works out.	0
It's time to trust ourselves more than our politicians.	0
That's why I'm going to do something unprecedented tonight.	0
My campaign will now give a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for an entire year to 10 American families, someone watching this at home right now.	0
If you believe that you can solve your own problems better than any politician, go to yang2020.com and tell us how $1,000 a month will help you do just that.	0
This is how we will get our country working for us again, the American people.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Mayor Pete Buttigieg?	0
It's original, I'll give you that.	0
The American people are divided and doubtful at the very moment we need to rise to some of the greatest challenges we've ever seen.	0
As a mayor of an industrial city coming back from the brink, as a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, I know what's at stake in our national leadership.	0
We keep sending politicians to Washington asking them to fight for us, but then when they get there, they seem more interested in the part about fighting than the part about us.	0
Good politics is supposed to be not about the day-to-day fights of the politicians, but about the day-to-day lives of Americans.	0
We just marked the anniversary of 9/11.	0
All day today, I've been thinking about September 12th, the way it felt when for a moment we came together as a country.	0
Imagine if we had been able to sustain that unity.	0
Imagine what would be possible right now with ideas that are bold enough to meet the challenges of our time, but big enough, as well, that they could unify the American people.	0
That's what presidential leadership can do.	0
That's what the presidency is for.	0
And that is why I'm asking for your vote.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Kamala Harris?	0
Thank you.	0
It's great to be back at TSU.	0
So I plan on spending tonight talking with you about my plans to address the problems that keep you up at night.	0
But first, I have a few words for Donald Trump, who we all know is watching.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
So, President Trump, you've spent the last two-and-a-half years full-time trying to sow hate and division among us, and that is why we've gotten nothing done.	0
You have used hate, intimidation, fear, and over 12,000 lies as a way to distract from your failed policies and your broken promises.	0
The only reason you've not been indicted is because there was a memo in the Department of Justice that says a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime.	0
But here's what you don't get: What you don't get you is that the American people are so much better than this.	0
And we know that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us, regardless of our race, where we live, or the party with which we're registered to vote.	0
And I plan on focusing on our common issues, our common hopes and desires, and in that way, unifying our country, winning this election, and turning the page for America.	0
And now, President Trump, you can go back to watching Fox News.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Bernie Sanders?	0
Senator Sanders?	0
Let me be blunt and tell you what you don't hear much about in Congress or in the media, and that is, it goes without saying that we must and will defeat Trump, the most dangerous president in the history of this country.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
But we must do more.	0
We must do more.	0
We have got to recognize that this country is moving into an oligarchic form of society where a handful of billionaires control the economic and political life of this country.	0
And as president, I am prepared to take them on.	0
Yes, we will raise the minimum wage to a living wage.	0
Yes, we will finally make sure that every American has health care as a human right, not a privilege.	0
And, yes, we will address the catastrophic crisis of climate change and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Elizabeth Warren?	0
So, I was born and raised in Oklahoma, but I'm sure glad to be in Texas tonight.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
All three of my brothers served in military bases here in Texas.	0
That was their ticket to the middle class.	0
Me, I got my big opportunity about a half-mile down the road from here at the University of Houston, back when it cost $50 a semester.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
For a price that I could pay for, on a part-time waitressing job, I got to finish my four-year degree and I became a special needs teacher.	0
And after law school, my first big job was back here in Houston.	0
By then, I had two little kids, and when childcare nearly brought me down, my Aunt Bee moved in and saved us all.	0
The paths to America's middle class have gotten a lot smaller and a lot narrower.	0
Today, service-members are preyed upon by predatory lenders.	0
Students are crushed by debt.	0
And families cannot afford childcare.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I know what's broken.	0
I know how to fix it.	0
And I'm going to lead the fight to get it done.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Vice President Joe Biden.	0
You know, when President Kennedy announced the moon shot, he used a phrase that sticks with me my whole life.	0
He said, we're doing it because we refuse to postpone.	0
Well, I refuse to postpone one more minute spending billions of dollars on curing cancer, Alzheimer's, and other diseases which, if we invest in them, we can find cures.	0
I refuse to postpone giving single child in America, no matter their zip code, pre-K all the way through high school and beyond.	0
I refuse to postpone any longer taking on climate change and leading the world in taking on climate change.	0
Look, this is the United States of America.	0
There has never been a single solitary time when we've set our mind to something we've been unable to do it.	0
We're walking around with our heads down like woe is me.	0
We're the best-equipped nation in the world to take this on.	0
It's no longer time to postpone.	0
We should get moving.	0
There's enormous, enormous opportunities once we get rid of Donald Trump.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Candidates, thank you.	0
Several of you said you are more united than divided, and that is certainly true.	0
All of you agree on one big thing, the goal of defeating President Trump, driving the country in a new direction.	0
But out on the campaign trail, you have outlined big differences over how far to go and how fast to go.	0
And, Vice President Biden, the differences between you and the senators on either side of you tonight strike at the heart of this primary debate.	0
Both senators Warren and Sanders want to replace Obamacare with Medicare for All.	0
You want to build on Obamacare, not scrap it.	0
They propose spending far more than you to combat climate change and tackle student loan debt.	0
And they would raise more in taxes than you to pay for their programs.	0
Are senators Warren and Sanders pushing too far beyond where Democrats want to go and where the country needs to go?	0
That will be for the voters to decide that question.	0
Let me tell you what I think.	0
I think we should have a debate on health care.	0
I think -- I know that the senator says she's for Bernie, well, I'm for Barack.	0
I think the Obamacare worked.	0
I think the way we add to it, replace everything that has been cut, add a public option, guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance, number one.	0
Number two, I think we should be in a position of taking a look at what costs are.	0
My plan for health care costs a lot of money.	0
It costs $740 billion.	0
It doesn't cost $30 trillion, $3.4 trillion a year, it turns out, is twice what the entire federal budget is.	0
That's before -- exists now, without interest on the debt.	0
How are we going to pay for it?	0
I want to hear that tonight how that's happened.	0
Thus far, my distinguished friend, the senator on my left, has not indicated how she pays for it.	0
And the senator has, in fact, come forward and said how he's going to pay for it, but it gets him about halfway there.	0
There's a lot of other things that need to be done.	0
I have a bold plan to deal with making sure we triple the money for at-risk schools that are Title I schools, from 15 to $45 billion a year.	0
But I go down the line and these are things we're talking about, I lay out how I can pay for it, how I can get it done, and why it's better.	0
Senator Warren, let me take that to you, particularly on what Senator Biden was saying there about health care.	0
He has actually praised Bernie Sanders for being candid about his health care plan, that Senator -- says that Sanders has been candid about the fact that middle class taxes are going to go up and most of private insurance is going to be eliminated.	0
Will you make that same admission?	0
So, let's be clear about health care.	0
And let's actually start where vice president did.	0
We all owe a huge debt to President Obama, who fundamentally transformed health care in America and committed this country to health care for every human being.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And now the question is, how best can we improve on it?	0
And I believe the best way we can do that is we make sure that everybody gets covered by health care at the lowest possible cost.	0
How do we pay for it?	0
We pay for it, those at the very top, the richest individuals and the biggest corporations, are going to pay more.	0
And middle class families are going to pay less.	0
That's how this is going to work.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Direct question.	0
You said middle class families are going to pay less.	0
But will middle class taxes go up to pail for pay for the program?	0
I know you believe that the deductibles and the premiums will go down.	0
Will middle class taxes go up?	0
Will private insurance be eliminated?	0
Look, what families have to deal with is cost, total cost.	0
That's what they have to deal with.	0
And understand, families are paying for their health care today.	0
Families pay every time an insurance company says, sorry, you can't see that specialist.	0
Every time an insurance company says, sorry, that doctor is out of network, sorry, we are not covering that prescription.	0
Families are paying every time they don't get a prescription filled because they can't pay for it.	0
They don't have a lump checked out because they can't afford the co-pay.	0
What we're talking about here is what's going to happen in families' pockets, what's going to happen in their budgets.	0
And the answer is on Medicare for All, costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to go up for giant corporations.	0
But for hard-working families across this country, costs are going to go down and that's how it should work under Medicare for All in our health care system.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Sanders, you were invoked by the vice president, also take on that question about taxes.	0
Well, Joe said that Medicare for All would cost over $30 trillion.	0
That's right, Joe.	0
Status quo over 10 years will be $50 trillion.	0
Every study done shows that Medicare for All is the most cost-effective approach to providing health care to every man, woman, and child in this country.	0
I, who wrote the damn bill, if I may say so...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... intend to eliminate all out-of-pocket expenses, all deductibles, all co-payments.	0
Nobody in America will pay more than $200 a year for prescription drugs, because we're going to stand up to the greed and corruption and price-fixing of the pharmaceutical industry.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We need -- we need a health care system that guarantees health care to all people as every other major country does, not a system which provides $100 billion a year in profit for the drug companies and the insurance companies.	0
And I'll tell you how absurd the system is tonight on ABC, the health care industry will be advertising, telling you how bad Medicare for All is, because they want to protect their profits.	0
That is absurd.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Vice president Biden...	0
If I could respond, George.	0
You get a response and then we're going to broaden out the discussion.	0
OK, number one, my health care plan does significantly cut the costs of -- the largest out-of-pocket payment you'll pay is $1,000.	0
You'll be able to get into a -- anyone who can't afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option we have, et cetera.	0
But guess what?	0
Of the 160 million people who like their health care now, they can keep it.	0
If they don't like it, they can leave.	0
Number one.	0
Number two, the fact of the matter is, we're in a situation where, if you notice, he hasn't answered the question.	0
This is about candor, honesty, big ideas.	0
Let's have a big idea.	0
The tax of 2 percent that the senator is talking about, that raises about $3 billion.	0
Guess what?	0
That leaves you $28 billion short.	0
The senator said before, it's going to cost you in your pay -- there will be a deductible, in your paycheck.	0
You're going to -- the middle class person, someone making 60 grand with three kids, they're going to end up paying $5,000 more.	0
They're going to end up paying 4 percent more on their income tax.	0
That's a reality.	0
Now, it's not a bad idea if you like it.	0
I don't like it.	0
OK, now I want everybody to keep to the time, but you did invoke both senators.	0
I have to get responses from them...	0
Sure, no, that's good.	0
... and then we will broaden it out.	0
Senator Warren, you go first.	0
So, let's be clear, I've actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I've met people who like their doctors.	0
I've met people who like their nurses.	0
I've met people who like their pharmacists.	0
I've met people who like their physical therapists.	0
What they want is access to health care.	0
And we just need to be clear about what Medicare for All is all about.	0
Instead of paying premiums into insurance companies and then having insurance companies build their profits by saying no to coverage, we're going to do this by saying, everyone is covered by Medicare for All, every health care provider is covered.	0
And the only question here in terms of difference is where to send the bill?	0
Senator Sanders.	0
Let us be clear, Joe, in the United States of America, we are spending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians or any other major country on earth.	0
This is America.	0
Yes, but Americans don't want to pay twice as much as other countries.	0
And they guarantee health care to all people.	0
Under my Medicare for All proposal, when you don't pay out-of-pocket and you don't pay premiums, maybe you've run into people who love their premiums, I haven't.	0
What people want is cost-effective health care, Medicare for All will save the average American substantial sums of money on his or her health care bill.	0
Senator Klobuchar, you said in your opening statement you don't -- you want to represent the people stuck in the middle of the extremes.	0
Who represents the extreme on this stage?	0
I think you know that I don't agree with some of these proposals up here, George, so I'm talking about...	0
Which ones?	0
If I could -- if I could respond to some of the proposals from my friends.	0
First of all, Senator Sanders and I have worked valiantly to bring down the cost of pharmaceuticals.	0
That was a Klobuchar-Sanders Amendment to allow for drugs to come in from less expensive countries like Canada.	0
We have worked to bring down the cost by fighting to allow 43 million seniors, that's a bill I lead, to negotiate for better prices under Medicare.	0
I figure that's a lot of seniors and they should be allowed to get a better price.	0
But when it comes to our health care and when it comes to our premiums, I go with the doctor's creed, which is, do no harm.	0
And while Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill.	0
And on page eight -- on page eight of the bill, it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it.	0
And that means that 149 million Americans will no longer be able to have their current insurance.	0
That's in four years.	0
I don't think that's a bold idea, I think it's a bad idea.	0
And what I favor is something that what Barack Obama wanted to do from the very beginning.	0
And that is a public option.	0
A non-profit choice that would bring down the cost of insurance, cover 12 million more people, and bring down the prices for 13 million more people.	0
That is a bold idea.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Warren, page eight of the bill, she says, 149 people will lose their health insurance.	0
I'm sorry.	0
She said, page eight of the bill, 149 million people will lose their health insurance.	0
Current health insurance.	0
One hundred forty-nine million.	0
Million, excuse me.	0
So let's be clear about this.	0
People will have access to all of their doctors, all of their nurses, their community hospitals, their rural hospitals.	0
Doctors won't have to hire people to fill out crazy forms.	0
They won't have to spend time on the phone arguing with insurance companies.	0
People who have sick family members won't have to get into these battles.	0
What this is about is making sure that we have the most efficient way possible to pay for health care for everyone in this country.	0
Insurance companies last year sucked $23 billion in profits out of the system.	0
How did they make that money?	0
Every one of those $23 billion was made by an insurance company saying no to your health care coverage.	0
Mayor Buttigieg?	0
The problem, Senator Sanders, with that damn bill that you wrote, and that Senator Warren backs, is that it doesn't trust the American people.	0
I trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you.	0
Not my way or the highway.	0
Now look, I think we do have to go far beyond tinkering with the ACA.	0
I propose Medicare for all who want it.	0
We take a version of Medicare, we make it available for the American people, and if we're right, as progressives, that that public alternative is better, then the American people will figure that out for themselves.	0
I trust the American people to make the right choice for them.	0
Why don't you?	0
Senator Sanders, 45 seconds.	0
George, you talked about, was it 150 million people on private insurance?	0
Fifty million of those people lose their private insurance every year when they quit their jobs or they go unemployed or their employer changes their insurance policy.	1
Medicare for All is comprehensive health care.	0
Covers all basic needs, including home health care.	0
It allows you to go to any doctor you want, which many private insurance company programs do not.	0
So, if you want comprehensive health care, freedom of choice regarding doctor or hospital, no more than $200 a year for prescription drugs, taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies, moving to Medicare for All is the way to go.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Harris, you startled out co-sponsoring Senator Sanders's bill, you now say you're uncomfortable with it.	0
Why?	0
I want to give credit first to Barack Obama for really bringing us this far.	0
We would not be here if he hadn't the courage, the talent, or the will to see us this far.	0
I want to give credit to Bernie.	0
Take credit, Bernie.	0
You know, you brought us this far on Medicare for All.	0
I support Medicare for All, I always have, but I wanted to make the plan better, which I did.	0
Which is about offering people choice, not taking that from them.	0
So, under my Medicare for all plan, people have the choice of a private plan or a public plan, because that's what people want.	0
And I agree, we shouldn't take choice from people.	0
But here's the thing.	0
Everybody on this stage, I do believe, is well intentioned and wants that all Americans have coverage and recognizes that right now 30 million Americans don't have coverage.	0
But at least five people have talked, some repeatedly on this subject, and not once have we talked about Donald Trump.	0
So let's talk about the fact that Donald Trump came into office and spent almost the entire first year of his term trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.	0
We all fought against it.	0
And then the late, great John McCain, at that moment at about 2 o'clock in the morning, killed his attempt to take health care from millions of people in this country.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Fast forward to today, and what is happening?	0
Donald Trump's Department of Justice is trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.	0
Donald Trump's administration is trying to get rid of the ban that we placed on denying people who have pre-existing conditions coverage.	0
Donald Trump is trying to say that our kids up to the age of 26 can no longer be on our plans.	0
And frankly, I think this discussion has given the American public a headache.	0
What they want to know is that they're going to have health care and cost will not be a barrier to getting it.	0
But let's focus on the end goal.	0
If we don't get Donald Trump out of office, he's going to get rid of all of it.	0
George, 15 seconds?	0
Fifteen seconds?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Let me get to Congressman O'Rourke and then bring you -- go ahead, Mr. Vice President.	0
Fifteen seconds.	0
Look, everybody says we want an option.	0
The option I'm proposing is Medicare for all -- Medicare for choice.	0
If you want Medicare, if you lose the job from your insurance -- from your employer, you automatically can buy into this.	0
You don't have -- no pre-existing condition can stop you from buying in.	0
You get covered, period.	0
And if you notice, nobody's yet said how much it's going to cost the taxpayer.	0
I hear this large savings, the president thinks -- my friend from Vermont thinks that the employer's going to give you back if you negotiated as a union all these years, got a cut in wages because you got insurance.	0
They're going to give back that money to the employee?	0
As a matter of fact, they will in our bill.	0
Well, let me tell you something.	0
For a socialist, you've got -- for a socialist, you've got a lot more confidence in corporate America than I do.	0
Senator Sanders?	0
OK, one minute, George?	0
Go ahead.	0
All right.	0
Two points.	0
You got to defend the fact that today not only do we have 87 million people uninsured and underinsured, you got to defend the fact that 500,000 Americans are going bankrupt.	0
You know why they're going bankrupt?	0
Because they suffered a terrible disease -- cancer or heart disease.	0
Under my legislation, people will not go into financial ruin because they suffered with a diagnosis of cancer.	0
And our program is the only one that does that.	0
I know a lot about cancer, let me tell you something.	0
It's personal to me.	0
Let me tell you something.	0
Every single person who is diagnosed with cancer or any other disease can automatically become part of this plan.	0
They will not go bankrupt because of that.	0
They will not go bankrupt because of that.	0
They can join immediately.	0
And we're talking four, six, eight, ten years, depending on who you talk about, before we get to Medicare for all.	0
Come on.	0
I've been there.	0
You've been there.	0
You know what it's like.	0
People need help now, hope now, and do something now.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Congressman O'Rourke?	0
Yeah.	0
Thank you.	0
Listen, I'm grateful that we all agree about the urgency of this challenge and the fact that Donald Trump is undermining the limited protections that we have right now.	0
But I also think we're being offered a false choice between those who propose an all-or-nothing gambit, forcing tens of millions off of insurance that they like, that works for them, to force them onto Medicare, and others who want to, as the vice president does, incrementally improve what we have, which will still leave many, maybe millions uninsured and uncared for.	0
In a state like Texas, where the largest provider of mental health care services is the county jail system, we've got to do better.	0
In my proposal, Medicare for America, says everyone who's uninsured will be enrolled in Medicare.	0
Everyone who's insufficiently insured, cannot afford it, can move over to Medicare.	0
And those, like members of unions who've fought for the health care plans that work for them and their families, are able to keep them.	0
This is the best possible path forward.	0
You just described my plan (ph).	0
This is -- health care is the top issue for everyone in the country.	0
I want to make sure everyone gets one minute to respond.	0
So, Secretary Castro, Andrew Yang, and then Senator Booker, you will get a minute.	0
Thank you.	0
And, you know, I also want to recognize the work that Bernie has done on this.	0
And, of course, we owe a debt of gratitude to President Barack Obama.	0
Of course, I also worked for President Obama, Vice President Biden, and I know that the problem with your plan is that it leaves 10 million people uncovered.	0
Now, on the last debate stage in Detroit, you said that wasn't true, when Senator Harris brought that up.	0
There was a fact check of that, and they said that was true.	0
You know, I grew up with a grandmother who had type 2 diabetes, and I watched her condition get worse and worse.	0
But that whole time, she had Medicare.	0
I want every single American family to have a strong Medicare plan available.	0
If they choose to hold on to strong, solid private health insurance, I believe they should be able to do.	0
But the difference between what I support and what you support, Vice President Biden, is that you require them to opt in and I would not require them to opt in.	1
They would automatically be enrolled.	1
They wouldn't have a buy in.	1
That's a big difference, because Barack Obama's vision was not to leave 10 million people uncovered.	0
He wanted every single person in this country covered.	0
My plan would do that.	0
Your plan would not.	0
They do not have to buy in.	0
They do not have to buy in.	0
You just said that.	0
You just said that two minutes ago.	0
You just two minutes ago that they would have to buy in.	0
Do not have to buy in if you can't afford it.	0
You said they would have to buy in.	0
Your grandmother would not have to buy in.	0
If she qualifies for Medicaid, she would automatically be enrolled.	0
Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?	0
Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago?	0
I mean, I can't believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you're saying they don't have to buy in.	0
You're forgetting that.	0
I said anyone like your grandmother who has no money.	0
I mean, look, look, we need a health care system...	0
She -- you're automatically enrolled.	0
It automatically enrolls people regardless of whether they choose to opt in or not.	0
If you lose your job, for instance, his health care plan would not automatically enroll you.	0
You would have to opt in.	0
My health care plan would.	0
That's a big difference.	0
I'm fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama, and you're not.	0
That'll be a surprise to him.	0
Andrew Yang?	0
Come on, guys.	0
This is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable.	0
Yeah.	0
This reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington, scoring points against each other, poking at each other, and telling each other that -- my plan, your plan.	0
Look, we all have different visions for what is better...	0
Yeah, that's called the Democratic primary election, Pete.	0
That's called an election.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
That's an election.	0
You know?	0
This is what we're here for.	0
It's an election.	0
Yes, but a house -- a house divided cannot stand.	0
And that is not how we're going to win this.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Look, everyone, we know we're on the same team here.	0
We know we're on the same team.	0
We all have a better vision for health care than our current president.	0
And I believe we're talking about this the wrong way.	0
As someone who has run a business, I know that our current health care system makes it harder to hire people, makes it harder to give them benefits and treat them as full-time employees.	0
You instead pretend their contractors.	0
It's harder to change jobs.	0
It's certainly harder to start a business.	0
The pitch we have to make to the American people is, we will get the health care weight off of your backs and then unleash the hopes and dreams of the American people.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Booker...	0
Now, I am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors, and they tell me that they spend a lot of time on paperwork, avoiding being sued, and navigating the insurance bureaucracy.	0
We have to change the incentives so instead of revenue and activity, people are focused on our health in the health care system.	0
And the Cleveland Clinic, where they're paid not based upon how many procedures they prescribe -- shocker -- they prescribe fewer procedures, and patient health stays the same or improves.	0
That is the pitch to the American people.	0
Senator Booker, close out this discussion.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Look, there are a lot of people watching at home right now, listening to us that are afraid because they are in crisis.	0
They don't have health insurance.	0
Their health insurance doesn't go far enough.	0
They can't afford their prescription drugs.	0
Look, I'm clear in what I believe.	0
I believe in Medicare for all.	0
I believe it's the best way to rationalize the system.	0
But dear God, I know every one of my colleagues on this stage is in favor of universal health coverage and comes at this with the best of intentions.	0
And I'll tell you, there is an urgency right now in this nation.	0
Everybody feels it.	0
And as a person who has an ideal, I know we cannot sacrifice progress on the altar of purity, because people in my community, they need help right now.	0
They have high blood pressure right now.	0
They have unaffordable insulin right now.	0
And this must be a moment where we as Democrats can begin to show that we cannot only stake and stand our ground, but find common ground, because we've got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And we cannot lose it by the way we talk about each other or demonize and degrade each other.	0
We can walk and chew gum at the same time.	0
If I am the leader, I will work towards the ideal of health insurance, health coverage being a right for all Americans.	0
But every single day, I'll join with other Democrats to make progress happen in our nation for the people that are struggling and suffering today.	0
Candidates, thank you.	0
Linsey Davis?	0
Thanks, George.	0
Since we're here at an HBCU, I'd like to start with young black voters.	0
Several recent polls indicate their number-one concern is racism.	0
This campus, this state, and this nation are still raw from that racially motivated attack on Latinos in El Paso.	0
Now, we know that the racial divide started long before President Trump and President Obama, but each of you on this stage has said that President Trump has made that divide worse.	0
Congressman O'Rourke, coming to you first, why are you the most qualified candidate to address this divide?	0
You know, I called this out in no uncertain terms on August 3rd and every day since then.	0
And I was talking about it long before then, as well.	0
Racism in America is endemic.	0
It is foundational.	0
We can mark the creation of this country not at the Fourth of July, 1776, but August 20, 1619, when the first kidnapped African...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... was brought to this country against his will and in bondage and as a slave built the greatness and the success and the wealth that neither he nor his descendants would ever be able to fully participate in and enjoy.	0
We have to be able to answer this challenge.	0
And it is found in our education system, where in Texas, a 5-year-old child in kindergarten is five times as likely to be disciplined or suspended or expelled based on the color of their skin.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
In our health care system, where there's a maternal mortality crisis three times as deadly for women of color, or the fact that there's 10 times the wealth in white America than there is in black America.	0
I'm going to follow Sheila Jackson Lee's lead and sign into law a reparations bill that will allow us to address this at its foundation.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
But we will also call out the fact that we have a white supremacist in the White House and he poses a mortal threat to people of color all across this country.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Secretary Castro, 45 seconds to respond.	0
Look, you know, I want to commend Beto for how well he has spoken to the passion and the frustration and the sadness after what happened in his hometown of El Paso.	0
He's done a great job with that.	0
Look, a few weeks ago, a shooter drove 10 miles inspired by this -- 10 hours inspired by this president to kill people who look like me and people who look like my family.	0
White supremacy is a growing threat to this country, and we have to root it out.	0
I'm proud that I put forward a plan to disarm hate.	0
I'm also proud that I was the first to put forward a police reform plan, because we're not going to have any more Laquan McDonalds or Eric Garners or Michael Browns or Pamela Turners or Walter Scotts or Sandra Bland, here from the Houston area.	0
We need to root out racism, and I believe that we can do that, because that doesn't represent the vast majority of Americans who do have a good heart.	0
They also need a leader to match that, and I will be a president that matches that.	0
"Senator Booker, you have said, quote, ""The real question isn't who is or isn't a racist."	0
"It's who is going to do something about it."""	0
Senator, what do you plan to do about it?	0
Well, first and foremost, I want to hit that point, because we know Donald Trump's a racist, but there is no red badge of courage for calling him that.	0
Racism exists.	0
The question isn't who isn't a racist.	0
It's who is and isn't doing something about racism.	0
And this is not just an issue that started yesterday.	0
It's not just an issue that we hear a president that can't condemn white supremacy.	0
We have systemic racism that is eroding our nation from health care to the criminal justice system.	0
And it's nice to go all the way back to slavery, but dear God, we have a criminal justice system that is so racially biased, we have more African-Americans under criminal supervision today than all the slaves in 1850.	1
We have to come at this issue attacking systemic racism, having the courage to call it out, and having a plan to do something about it.	0
If I am president of the United States, we will create an office in the White House to deal with the problem of white supremacy and hate crimes.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And we will make sure that systemic racism is dealt with in substantive plans, from criminal justice reform to the disparities in health care to even one that we don't talk about enough, which is the racism that we see in environmental injustice in communities of color all around this country.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Mayor Buttigieg, you've been struggling with issues around race in your own community.	0
You've also said that anyone who votes to re-elect President Trump is, at best, looking the other way on racism.	0
Does that sort of talk alienate voters and potentially deepen divisions in our country?	0
I believe what's deepened divisions in the country is the conduct of this president, and we have a chance to change all of that.	0
Look, systemic racism preceded this president, and even when we defeat him, it will be with us.	0
That's why we need a systemic approach to dismantle it.	0
It's -- it's not enough to just take a racist policy, replace it with a neutral one and expect things will just get better on their own.	0
Harms compound.	0
In the same way that a dollar saved compounds, so does a dollar stolen.	0
And we know that the generational theft of the descendants of slaves is part of why everything from housing to education to health to employment basically puts us in two different countries.	0
I have proposed the most comprehensive vision to tackle systemic racism in every one of these areas, marshaling as many resources as went into the Marshall plan that rebuilt Europe, but this time, a Douglass plan that we invest right here at home, to make sure that we're not only dealing with things like the overincarceration of black Americans, but also black solutions, entrepreneurship, raising to 25 percent...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... the target for the federal government to do business with minority-owned businesses, investing in HBCUs that are training and educating the next generation of entrepreneurs.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We can and must do that.	0
But that means transcending this framework that pits us against each other, that pits a single black mother of three against a displaced auto worker.	0
Because when I -- where I come from, a lot of times that displaced auto worker is a single black mother of three.	0
We've got to say that...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... and bring people together.	0
Also a concern for people of color is criminal justice reform.	0
Senator Harris, you released your plan for that just this week.	0
And it does contradict some of your prior positions.	0
Among them, you used to oppose the legalization of marijuana; now you don't.	0
You used to oppose outside investigations of police shootings; now you don't.	0
"You've said that you changed on these and other things because you were, quote, ""swimming against the current, and thankfully the currents have changed."""	0
But when you had the power, why didn't you try to effect change then?	0
(APPLAUSE) (ph)	0
So, there have been -- there have been -- I'm glad you asked me this question, and there have been many distortions of my record.	0
Let me be very clear.	0
I made a decision to become a prosecutor for two reasons.	0
One, I've always wanted to protect people and keep them safe.	0
And second, I was born knowing about how this criminal justice system in America has worked in a way that has been informed by racial bias.	0
And I could tell you extensively about the experiences I and my family members have personally had.	0
But I made a decision that, if I was going to have the ability to reform the system, I would try to do it from the inside.	0
And so I took on the position that allowed me, without asking permission, to create one of the first in the nation initiatives that was a model and became a national model around people who were arrested for drugs and getting them jobs.	0
I created one of the first in the nation requirements that a state law enforcement agency would have to wear cameras and keep them on full-time.	0
I created one of the first in the nation trainings for a police officer on the issue of racial bias and the need to reform the system.	0
Was I able to get enough done?	0
Absolutely not.	0
But my plan has been described by activists as being a bold and comprehensive plan that is about ending mass incarceration, about taking the profit out of the criminal justice system.	0
I plan on shutting down for-profit prisons on day one.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
It will be about what we need to do to hold law enforcement, including prosecutors, accountable.	0
And finally, my plan is about making sure that, in America's criminal justice system, we de-incarcerate women and children, that we end solitary confinement and that we work on keeping families intact.	0
And as president of the United States, knowing the system from the inside, I will have the ability to be an effective leader and get this job complete.	0
Thank you, Senator Harris.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Klobuchar, during your eight years as a prosecutor in Minnesota, there were dozens of incidents where black men were killed by police.	0
Critics say that too often you sided with police in these cases.	0
The ACLU's legal director in Minnesota has said that you showed no interest in racial justice.	0
Do you wish now that you had done more?	0
That's not my record.	0
(inaudible)	0
We are here at a historically black college.	0
And I think of an alum of that college, Barbara Jordan, and something that she once said.	0
"She said, ""What the people want is simple; they want a country as good as its promise."""	0
And that same can be said of the criminal justice system.	0
So when I was there, the way we handled these police shootings, I actually took a stand to make sure outside investigators handled them.	0
I took on our major police chief in Minneapolis.	0
But in the prosecutor's office, they were handled with a grand jury.	0
That's how they were all handled across our state.	0
I now believe it is better for accountability if the prosecutor handles them and makes those decisions herself.	0
That aside, I am proud of the work our staff did, 400 people in our office.	0
The cases that came to us, the African-American community that came to us, they said there was no justice for their little kids.	0
There was a kid named Byron Phillips that was shot on his front porch.	0
No one had bothered to figure out who did it.	0
When I came into that office, we worked with the community groups; we put up billboards; we found the shooter and we put him in jail.	0
We did the same for the killer of a little girl named Tyesha Edwards who was doing her homework at her kitchen table and was shot through the window.	0
What changes did we make?	0
Go after white-collar crimes in a big way, diversity the office in a big way, work with the Innocence Project to make sure we do much better with eyewitness ID.	0
And as a senator and as your president, I will make sure that we don't just do the First Step Act when it comes to criminal sentencing, that we move to the Second Step Act, which means the 90 percent of people that are incarcerated in local and state jails, let's reduce those sentences for nonviolent offenders and let's get them jobs and let them vote when they get out of prison.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.	0
You all believe that the war on drugs has put too many Americans behind bars.	0
Vice President Biden, you have a plan to release many nonviolent drug offenders from prison.	0
Senator Booker says that your plan is not ambitious enough.	0
Your response?	0
Well, first of all, let me say that, when I came back from law school, I had a job with a great -- a big-time law firm.	0
I left and became a public defender because my state was under siege when Dr. King was assassinated.	0
We were occupied by the National Guard for 10 months.	0
I've been involved from the beginning.	0
As a young congressman -- as a young councilman, I introduced legislation to try to keep them from putting a sewer plant in a poor neighborhood.	0
I made sure that we dealt with redlining; banks should have to lend where they operate, et cetera.	0
The fact of the matter is that what's happened is that we're in a situation now where there are so many people who are in jail and shouldn't be in jail.	0
The whole means by which this should change is the whole model has to change.	0
We should be talking about rehabilitation.	0
Nobody should be in jail for a nonviolent crime.	0
As -- when we were in the White House, we released 36,000 people from the federal prison system.	0
Nobody should be in jail for a drug problem.	0
They should be going directly to a rehabilitation.	0
We build more rehabilitation centers, not prisons.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We -- I'm the guy that put in the drug courts to divert people from the criminal justice system.	0
And so we have to change the whole way we look at this.	0
When we put people in prison, we have to equip them that when they get out -- nobody who got in prison for marijuana, for example, immediately upon being released -- they shouldn't be in there; that should be a misdemeanor.	0
They should be out and their record should be expunged.	0
Every single right should be returned.	0
When you finish your term in prison, you should be able not only to vote but have access to Pell grants, have access to be able to get housing...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... have access to be able to move along the way.	0
I've laid out a detailed plan along those lines.	0
And the fact is, we've learned so much more more...	0
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.	0
Thank you.	0
Senator Booker, 45 seconds to respond.	0
Our criminal justice system is so savagely broken.	0
There's no difference in America between blacks, whites and Latinos for using drugs or dealing drugs.	0
But if you are African-American, you are almost four times more likely to be arrested and incarcerated, destroying your lives.	0
And so much of this comes down to privilege.	0
We have a criminal justice system that Brian Stephenson (ph) says treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.	0
And so I have challenged this whole field.	0
We can specifically and demonstrably now show that there are 17,000 people unjustly incarcerated in America, and all of us should come forward and say, when we are president of the United States; when I am president of the United States, we will release them.	0
And let me be specific.	0
I joined together and led in the United States Senate the only major bipartisan bill to pass under this president, for criminal justice reform, that has already led to thousands of people coming out of jail.	0
If 87 members of the United States Senate says that these sentences are way too long, and we changed it, but we didn't make it retroactive, we could literally point to the people that are in jail unjustly right now.	0
Everyone on this stage should say that we are going to give clemency to these 17,000 people.	0
And I challenge you.	0
Don't just say a big statement; back it up with details of the people in prison right now looking for one of the most sacrosanct ideals of this nation, which is liberty and freedom.	0
We need to reform this system and we must do it now.	0
Every day we wait is too long.	0
Thank you, Senator Booker.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
David?	0
Thank you, Linsey.	0
I want to turn to the deadly mass shootings here in this country.	0
And of course we are all mindful tonight of where we stand.	0
We are here in Texas tonight, where 29 people have lost their lives in just the last month alone, El Paso, which we've discussed; in Odessa.	0
And I know there are survivors from El Paso right here in the hall tonight.	0
Vice President Biden, I do want to direct this to you, because we all remember Sandy Hook.	0
Twenty-six people died in that school, 20 of them children.	0
Those first graders would be in eighth grade today.	0
At the time, there was a groundswell in this country to get something done.	0
President Obama asked you to lead the push for gun control.	0
You have often pointed to your ability to reach across the aisle to get things done, but four months after Sandy Hook, a measure to require expanded background checks died on the Senate floor.	0
If you couldn't get it done after Sandy Hook, why should voters give you another chance?	0
Because I got it done before.	0
I'm the only one up here that's ever beat the NRA --only one ever to beat the NRA nationally.	0
I'm the guy that brought the Brady bill into -- into focus and became law.	0
And so that's number one.	0
Number two, after Sandy Hook, a number of things happened.	0
It went from a cause to a movement.	0
Look what's happened now.	0
Mothers -- the organization -- mothers against violence -- gun violence.	0
We've seen what's happened again.	0
Now we have all these young people marching on Washington, making sure that things are going to change.	0
There has been a sea change.	0
Those proposals I put forward for the president had over 50 percent of gun -- of gun -- of members of the NRA supporting them, and overwhelmingly the rest of the people supporting them.	0
Now the numbers are much higher, because they realize what I've been saying and we've all been saying is correct.	0
Over 90% of the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street -- period.	1
And we have to get buy-backs and get them out of their basements.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
So the point is, things have changed.	0
And things have changed a lot.	0
And now what's happening is -- and, by the way, the way Beto handled -- excuse me for saying Beto.	0
What the congressman...	0
That's all right.	0
Beto's good.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
The way he handled what happened in his hometown is meaningful, to look in the eyes of those people, to see those kids...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... to understand those parents, you understand the heartache.	0
But this is the problem.	0
We are ready to do this.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Mr. Vice President...	0
This is the problem.	0
Thank you.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... you did bring up assault weapons here.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
You did bring up assault weapons here, and many of you on this stage have talked about executive order.	0
Senator Harris, you have said that you would take executive action on guns within your first 100 days...	0
Correct.	0
... including banning imports of AR-15 assault weapons.	0
That's right.	0
President Obama, after Sandy Hook, more than 23 executive actions, and yet here we all are today.	0
"In recent days former Vice President Biden has said about executive orders, ""Some really talented people are seeking the nomination."	0
"They said 'I'm going to issue an executive order.'"""	0
"Biden saying, ""There's no constitutional authority to issue that executive order when they say 'I'm going to eliminate assault weapons,'"" saying, ""you can't do it by executive order any more than Trump can do things when he says he can do it by executive order."""	0
Does the vice president have a point there?	0
Some things you can.	0
Many things you can't.	0
Let's let the senator answer.	0
Well, I mean, I would just say, hey, Joe, instead of saying, no, we can't, let's say yes, we can.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Let's be constitutional.	0
We've got a Constitution.	0
And yes, we can, because I'll tell you something.	0
The way that I think about this is, I've seen more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you.	0
I have attended more police officer funerals than I care to tell you.	0
I have hugged more mothers of homicide victims than I care to tell you.	0
And the idea that we would wait for this Congress, which has just done nothing, to act, is just -- it is overlooking the fact that every day in America, our babies are going to school to have drills, elementary, middle and high school students, where they are learning about how they have to hide in a closet or crouch in a corner if there is a mass shooter roaming the hallways of their school.	0
"I was talking about this at one of my town halls, and -- and this child who was eight years old, probably, came up to me -- it was like it was a secret between the two of us, and he tugged on my jacket and he said, ""I had to have one of those drills."""	0
It is traumatizing our children.	0
El Paso -- and, Beto, God love you for standing so courageously in the midst of that tragedy.	0
You know, people asked me...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... in El Paso -- they said, you know, because I have a long-standing record on this issue.	0
"They said, ""Well, do you think Trump is responsible for what happened?"""	0
"And I said, ""Well, look, I mean, obviously, he didn't pull the trigger, but he's certainly been tweeting out the ammunition."""	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Harris, thank you.	0
Vice President Biden, do you still stand by what you said on an executive order?	0
No, what I said was -- the question -- speak to constitutional scholars.	0
"If in fact we could say, ""By the way, you can't own the following weapons, period; they cannot be sold anymore"" -- check with constitutional scholars."	0
Now, you can say...	0
Mr. Vice President, thank you.	0
Congressman O'Rourke, I want to get to you on this.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
John, could I tell you what you could do in 100 days?	0
I'm going to -- I'm going to work down the row here.	0
But I do want to come to Congressman O'Rourke, because I know this is personal to you.	0
El Paso is your hometown.	0
Some on this stage have suggested a voluntary buy-back for guns in this country.	0
You've gone further.	0
"You've said, quote, ""Americans who own AR-15s and AK-47s will have to sell them to the government, all of them."""	0
You know that critics call this confiscation.	0
Are you proposing taking away their guns?	0
And how would this work?	0
I am, if it's a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
If the high impact, high velocity round, when it hits your body, shreds everything inside of your body, because it was designed to do that, so that you would bleed to death on a battlefield and not be able to get up and kill one of our soldiers.	0
When we see that being used against children, and in Odessa, I met the mother of a 15-year-old girl who was shot by an AR-15, and that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour because so many other people were shot by that AR-15 in Odessa and Midland, there weren't enough ambulances to get to them in time, hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Congressman, thank you.	0
And I want to say this.	0
I'm listening to the people of this country.	0
The day after I proposed doing that, I went to a gun show in Conway, Arkansas, to meet with those who were selling AR-15s and AK-47s and those who were buying those weapons.	0
And you might be surprised, there was some common ground there, folks who said, I would willingly give that up, cut it to pieces, I don't need this weapon to hunt, to defend myself.	0
It is a weapon of war.	0
So, let's do the right thing, but let's bring everyone in America into the conversation, Republicans, Democrats, gun-owners, and non-gun owners alike.	0
May I make a point?	0
Congressman, thank you.	0
I want to bring in Senator Klobuchar on this, because you've often talked about your uncle and the proud hunters back home in Minnesota.	0
So I wanted to get your response to Congressman O'Rourke tonight.	0
Where do you stand on mandatory gun buybacks?	0
I so appreciate what the congressman's been doing.	0
And I want to remind people here that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us.	0
Everyone up here favors an assault weapon ban.	0
Everyone up here favors magazine limitations, which, by the way, would have made a huge difference if that was in place in El Paso, in that store, where all those ordinary people showed such extraordinary courage.	0
And certainly in Dayton, Ohio, where in 30 seconds, one man guns down innocent people.	0
The cops got there in one minute, and it still wasn't enough to save those people.	0
That's what unites us.	0
You know what else unites us?	0
And I'll tell you this.	0
What unites us is that right now, on Mitch McConnell's desk, are three bills -- universal background checks, closing the Charleston loophole, and passing my bill to make sure that domestic abusers don't get AK-47s.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Klobuchar?	0
So if we want to get something done -- and I personally think we should start with a voluntary buyback program.	0
That's what I think, David.	0
But I want to finish this, because if you want action now, if you want action now, we got to send a message to Mitch McConnell.	0
We can't wait until one of us gets in the White House.	0
We have to pass those bills right now to get this done.	0
Senator Klobuchar...	0
Because we cannot spare another innocent life.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
I want to turn to Senator Booker, because you have said just this week about guns and about the candidates on this stage, that the differences do matter.	0
Those were your words.	0
You have argued, if you need a license to drive a car in this country, you should have a license to buy a gun.	0
Gun-owners would not only have to pass a background check, they would have to obtain a federal license to buy a gun.	0
This would require, as you know, Congress to pass legislation.	0
If Democrats can't get universal background checks, how would you get this done?	0
And can you name one Republican colleague of yours in the Senate right now who would be onboard with this idea?	0
So, background checks and gun licensing, these are agreed to by overwhelmingly the majority of Americans.	0
Eighty-three percent of Americans agree with licensing.	0
This is the issue.	0
Look, I grew up in the suburbs.	0
It was about 20 years ago that I came out of my home when I moved to inner city Newark, New Jersey, and witnessed the aftermath of a shooting.	0
It's one of the reasons why shooting after shooting after shooting in neighborhoods like mine for decades, this has been a crisis for me.	0
It's why I was the first person to come out for gun licensing.	0
And I'm happy that people like Beto O'Rourke are showing such courage now and coming forward and also now supporting licensing.	0
But this is what I'm sorry about.	0
I'm sorry that it had to take issues coming to my neighborhood or personally affecting Beto to suddenly make us demand change.	0
This is a crisis of empathy in our nation.	0
We are never going to solve this crisis if we have to wait for it to personally affect us or our neighborhood or our community before we demand action.	0
You want to know how we get this done?	0
We get this done by having a more courageous empathy, where people don't wait for this hell to visit upon their communities.	0
They stand up and understand the truth of what King said, that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.	0
I will lead change on this issue, because I have seen what the carnage creates in communities like mine, because we forget, national shootings, these mass shootings are tragedies, but the majority of the homicide victims come from neighborhoods like mine.	0
Nobody has ascended to the White House that will bring more personal passion on this issue.	0
I will fight this and bring a fight to the NRA and the corporate gun lobby like they have never seen before.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Booker, thank you.	0
A quick follow-up, though, because Americans watching tonight know the reality of Congress in Washington.	0
I asked do you have a Republican colleague in the Senate who would be onboard with this idea to get this done?	0
You know, if that was the attitude when Strom Thurmond had the longest filibuster ever on civil rights, if it was this idea that we can't get it done because of the situation in the Senate, I'm looking to lead a movement.	0
The number-one reason why governments are formed is to protect the citizenry.	0
Think about this.	0
We have had more people die due to gun violence in my lifetime than every single war in this country combined, from the Revolutionary War until now.	0
This is not a side issue to me.	0
It is a central issue to me.	0
That is the kind of fight -- because the majority of homicide victims -- we have a mass shooting every single day in communities like mine.	0
We must awaken a more courageous empathy in this country so that we stand together and fight together and overwhelm those Republicans who are not even representing their constituency.	0
Because the majority of Americans, the majority of gun-owners agree with me, not the corporate gun lobby.	0
It is time for a movement on this issue, and I will lead it.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Go beat them (ph).	0
Senator Booker, thank you.	0
Senator Warren, I want to come to you next, because you have actually said in recent days that there are things you can get done with Republicans in the Senate.	0
What can you get done on gun control?	0
So let's start by framing the problem the right way.	0
We have a gun violence problem in this country.	0
The mass shootings are terrible, but they get all the headlines.	0
Children die every day on streets, in neighborhoods, on playgrounds.	0
People die from violence, from suicide and domestic abuse.	0
We have a gun violence problem in this country.	0
And we agree on many steps we could take to fix it.	0
My view on this is, we're going to -- it's not going to be one and done on this.	0
We're going to do it, and we're going to have to do it again, and we're going to have to come back some more until we cut the number of gun deaths in this country significantly.	0
But here's the deal.	0
The question we need to ask is, when we've got this much support across the country, 90 percent of Americans want to see us do -- I like registration -- want to see us do background checks, want to get assault weapons off the streets, why doesn't it happen?	0
And the answer is corruption, pure and simple.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We have a Congress that is beholden to the gun industry.	0
And unless we're willing to address that head-on and roll back the filibuster, we're not going to get anything done on guns.	0
I was in the United States Senate when 54 senators said let's do background checks, let's get rid of assault weapons, and with 54 senators, it failed because of the filibuster.	1
Until we attack the systemic problems, we can't get gun reform in this country.	0
We've got to go straight against the industry and we've got to change Congress, so it doesn't just work for the wealthy and well-connected, so it works for the people.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Warren, thank you.	0
You bring up eliminating the filibuster, which means you would need simply a simple majority in a Republican Senate to get something done.	0
I want to turn to Senator Sanders on this, because you've said before of this, if Donald Trump supports ending the filibuster, which he's talked about himself, you should be nervous.	0
Would you support ending the filibuster?	0
No.	0
But what I would support, absolutely, is passing major legislation, the gun legislation the people here are talking about, Medicare for all, climate change legislation that saves the planet.	0
I will not wait for 60 votes to make that happen, and you can do it in a variety of ways.	0
You can do that through budget reconciliation law.	0
You have a vice president who will, in fact, tell the Senate what is appropriate and what is not, what is in order and what is not.	0
But I want to get back to a point that Elizabeth made and that, in fact, in terms of gun issues, picking up on Cory and Beto and everybody else, what we are looking at is a corrupt political system, and that means whether it is the drug companies or the insurance companies or the fossil fuel industry determining what's happening in Washington or, in this case, you've got an NRA which has intimidated the president of the United States and the Republican leadership.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
"I am proud -- I am proud that, year after year, I had an ""F"" rating from the NRA."	0
And as president, I will not be intimidated by the NRA.	0
Senator Sanders, thank you.	0
May I respond...	0
We've been hearing a lot about what's been happening here in Texas.	0
Only a few weeks ago, the deadliest massacre of Latinos, Latinos, in modern U.S. history happened in this state, in El Paso.	0
So the fear among Latinos -- and you know this -- is very real.	0
So let me start with an issue that is causing a lot of division in this country: immigration.	0
"Vice President Biden, as a presidential candidate, in 2008, you supported the border wall, saying, ""Unlike most Democrats, I voted for 700 miles of fence."""	0
This is what you said.	0
Then you served as vice president in an administration that deported 3 million people, the most ever in U.S. history.	0
Did you do anything to prevent those deportations?	0
I mean, you've been asked this question before and refused to answer, so let me try once again.	0
Are you prepared to say tonight that you and President Obama made a mistake about deportations?	0
Why should Latinos trust you?	0
What Latinos should look at is -- comparing this president to the president we have is outrageous, number one.	0
We didn't lock people up in cages.	1
We didn't separate families.	1
We didn't do all of those things, number one.	0
Number two -- number two, by the time -- this is a president who came along with the DACA program.	0
No one had ever done that before.	0
This is the president that sent legislation to the desk saying he wants to find a pathway for the 11 million undocumented in the United States of America.	0
This is a president who's done a great deal.	0
So I'm proud to have served with him.	0
What I would do as president is several more things, because things have changed.	0
I would, in fact, make sure that there is -- we immediately surge to the border.	0
All those people who are seeking asylum, they deserve to be heard.	0
That's who we are.	0
We're a nation who says, if you want to flee, and you're freeing oppression, you should come.	0
I would change the order that the president just changed, saying women who were being beaten and abused could no longer claim that as a reason for asylum.	0
And by the way, retrospectively, you know, the 25th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act is up.	0
The Republican Congress has not reauthorized it.	0
Let's put pressure on them to pass the Violence Against Women Act.	0
Now (inaudible) back...	0
Yeah, but you didn't answer the question.	0
Well, I did answer the question.	0
No, did you make a mistake with those deportations?	0
The president did the best thing that was able to be done at the time.	0
How about you?	0
I'm the vice president of the United States.	0
Secretary Castro, would you want to respond to Vice President Biden?	0
I mean, look...	0
And let me put this in context, because your party controlled the White House and Congress in 2009 and didn't pass immigration reform, and this broke a promise made by President Barack Obama to Latinos.	0
So why should voters trust Democrats now?	0
I mean, now it is even more difficult, as you know, because you need Republican votes in the Senate.	0
So are you willing, for instance, to give up DACA or give up a path to citizenship or even agree to build a wall in order to legalize 10.5 million undocumented immigrants?	0
Jorge, thank you very much for that question.	0
And, look, I agree that Barack Obama was very different from Donald Trump.	0
Donald Trump has a dark heart when it comes to immigrants.	0
He built his whole political career so far on scapegoating and fearmongering and otherizing migrants, and that's very different from Barack Obama.	0
But my problem with Vice President Biden -- and Cory pointed this out last time -- is every time something good about Barack Obama comes up, he says, oh, I was there, I was there, I was there, that's me, too, and then every time somebody questions part of the administration that we were both part of, he says, well, that was the president.	0
I mean, he wants to take credit for Obama's work, but not have to answer to any questions.	0
I mean...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Vice President Biden, you have -- you have 45 seconds.	0
Let me just say...	0
That's not what I said.	0
Let me just say...	0
That's not what I said.	0
Jorge, let me just say that I would -- I was the first candidate in early April to put forward an immigration plan.	0
You know why?	0
Because I'm not afraid of Donald Trump on this issue.	0
I'm not going to back pedal.	0
I'm not going to pretend like I don't have my own vision for immigration.	0
So we're not going to give up DACA.	0
We're not going to give up protections for anybody.	0
I believe that on January 20, 2021, we're going to have a Democratic president, we're going to throw out Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn and have a Democratic Senate, and a Democratic House, and we're going to pass immigration reform within the first 100 days.	0
Vice President, 45 seconds.	0
I did not say I don't -- I stand with Barack Obama all eight years, good, bad and indifferent.	0
That's where I stand.	0
I did not say I did not stand with him.	0
OK, Senator Warren, hundreds of children have been separated from their parents at the border.	0
And recently, in Mississippi, we saw the largest immigration raid in a decade.	0
You want ICE, the agency in charge of rounding up undocumented immigrants.	0
So how would you deal with the millions of immigrants who arrive legally but overstay their visas?	0
And how would you stop hundreds of thousands of Central Americans who want to migrate to the U.S.?	0
Well, I start with a statement of principles, and that is, in this country, immigration does not make us weaker, immigration makes us stronger.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I want to see us expand legal immigration and create a pathway to citizenship for our DREAMers, but also for their grandparents, and for their cousins, for people who have overstayed student visas, and for people who came here to work in the fields.	0
I want to have a system that is a path to citizenship that is fair and achievable.	0
Down at the border, we've got to rework this entirely.	0
A system right now that cannot tell the difference in the threat posed by a terrorist, a criminal, and a 12-year-old girl is not a system that is keeping us safer, and it is not serving our values.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Mr. Yang...	0
We need -- I want to add one more part on this, because I think we have to look at all the pieces.	0
Why do we have a crisis at the border?	0
In no small part because we have withdrawn help from people in Central America who are suffering.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We need to restore that help.	0
We need to help establish and re-establish the rule of law so that people don't feel like they have to flee for their lives.	0
We have a crisis that Donald Trump has created and hopes to profit from politically.	0
We have to have the courage to stand up and fight back.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Mr. Yang?	0
It is true that in the last few years we have seen the most severe anti-immigrant measures, from putting kids in cages to limiting asylum for people fleeing gangs and domestic violence.	0
But it is also true about 1 million immigrants enter the U.S. legally every year.	0
So, are you willing to raise the number of legal immigrants from 1 million to 2 million per year?	0
And should there be a merit system, as President Trump wants?	0
So, yes -- oh, I'm sorry.	0
Did you me or...	0
It was me.	0
Oh, he said it.	0
OK.	0
Sorry.	0
My -- my father grew up on a peanut farm in Asia with no floor and now his son is running for president.	0
That is the immigration story that we have...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... to be able to share with the American people.	0
If you look at our history, almost half of Fortune 500 companies were founded by either immigrants or children of immigrants.	0
And rates of business formation are much higher in immigrant communities.	0
We have to say to the American people, immigrants are positive for our economic and social dynamism, and I would return the level of legal immigration to the point it was under the Obama-Biden administration.	0
I think we have to compete for talent and I am the opposite of Donald Trump in many ways.	0
He says, build a wall.	0
I'm going to say to immigrants, come to America, because if you come here, your son our daughter can run for president.	0
The water is great.	0
And this is where you want to build a company, build a family, and build a life.	0
This country has been a magnet for human capital for generations.	0
If we lose that, we lose something integral to our continued success.	0
And that is where I would lead as president.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
(SPEAKING SPANISH)	0
Gracias.	0
(INAUDIBLE) Pete, eight out of 10 Latinos in Texas for another mass shooter targeting them.	0
This is according to a new Univision poll.	0
President Trump has called Mexican immigrants rapists and killers, tried to ban Muslims from entering the country separated children from their parents.	0
He supporters have chanted, build a wall and send her back.	0
Do you think that people who support President Trump and his immigration policies are racist?	0
Anyone who supports this is supporting racism.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
(SPEAKING SPANISH)	0
The only people, though, who actually buy into this president's hateful rhetoric around immigrants are people who don't know any.	0
We have an opportunity to build an American majority around immigration reform.	0
In my community, a group of conservative Republicans rallied around an individual, a beloved local individual who was deported when he went into ICE to try to get his paperwork sorted out, because they never thought it would happen to him.	0
In some of the most conservative, rural areas of Iowa, I have seen communities that embraced immigration grow.	0
And that's why part of my plan for revitalizing the economies of rural America includes community renewal visas that would allow cities and towns and counties that are hurting not only for jobs but for population to embrace immigration as we have in my city.	0
You know, the only reason that South Bend is growing right now, after years of shrinking, is immigration.	0
It's one of the reasons we acted, not waiting for Washington, to create city-issued municipal IDs, so that people, regardless of immigration status in our city, had the opportunity to have the benefits of identification.	0
We have an opportunity to actually get something done.	0
But we cannot allow this continue to be the same debate with the same arguments and the same clever lines often among the same people since the last real reform happened in the 1980s.	0
We have to actually engage the American majority around the opportunities for not just growth in small communities, but our values.	0
Values of welcome, values of faith that all argue for us to manage this humanely and in a way that marries our values with our laws.	0
(SPEAKING SPANISH)	0
"In an interview eight months ago, you were asked to asked what to do with the so-called ""over-stayers,"" people who come with a visa and then stay."	0
And you said, I don't know.	0
Do you have an answer now?	0
I do.	0
And if you read the rest of that article in The Washington Post, I talked about harmonizing our entry/exit system with Mexico in the same way that we do with Canada.	0
I think that could help us to keep a handle on visa over-stays.	0
But I think the larger question that we're trying to get at is, how do we rewrite this country's immigration laws in our own image?	0
In the image of Houston, Texas, the most diverse city in the United States of America.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
In the image of El Paso, Texas, one of the safest cities in the United States of America.	0
Safe, not despite the fact that we are a city of immigrants, safe because we are a city of immigrants.	0
(SPEAKING SPANISH)	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I will lead an effort to make sure that we rewrite our immigration laws in that way.	0
Never cage another child.	0
Make sure that there is accountability and justice for the seven lives lost under our care and our custody, but also face the fact that Democrats and Republicans alike voted to build a wall that has produced thousands of deaths of people trying to cross to join family or to work a job.	0
That we have been part of deporting people, hundreds of thousands just in the Obama administration alone, who posed no threat to this country, breaking up their families.	0
Democrats have to get off the back foot, we have to lead on this issue, because we know it is right.	0
Legalize America, begin with those more than 1 million DREAMers, make them U.S. citizens right now in this, their true home country...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... and extend that to their parents, their sisters and their brothers, and ensure that we have a legal, safe, orderly system to come to this country and add to our greatness here.	0
Thank you.	0
George.	0
Jorge, thank you.	0
We're going to take a quick break.	0
When we come back, national security, foreign policy, homeland security, the impact on American jobs and U.S. troops.	0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
"Live from Texas Southern University in Houston, the ""Democratic Debate."""	0
Welcome back.	0
We want to turn now to national security and the foreign policy issue that has such a direct impact here at home.	0
The U.S. relationship with China, trade, and President Trump's tariffs.	0
We received more than 100 questions from viewers wanting to know how all of you are going to handle these tariffs.	0
And, Mr. Yang, let me begin with you.	0
Would you repeal the tariffs on your first day in office?	0
And if so, would you risk losing leverage in our trade relationship with China?	0
I would not repeal the tariffs on day one, but I would let the Chinese know that we need to hammer out a deal, because right now, the tariffs are pummeling producers and farmers in Iowa who have absolutely nothing to do with the imbalances that we have with China.	0
A CEO friend of mine was in China recently and he said that he saw pirated U.S. intellectual property on worker workstations to the tune of thousands of dollars per head.	0
And he said, one, how can my workers compete against that?	0
And, two, think about all the lost revenue to American companies.	0
So, the imbalances are real.	0
But we have to let the Chinese know that we recognize that President Trump has pursued an arbitrary and haphazard trade policy that has had victims on both sides.	0
So, no to repealing the tariffs immediately, but yes to making sure we come to a deal that addresses the concerns of American companies and American producers.	0
Mayor Pete, let me take that question -- let me take that question to you, because you've seen President Trump's tweets.	0
He says what's going to happen here is the Chinese are just going to wait him out so that they can get a Democrat who they can take advantage of.	0
How do you think about China?	0
We've seen President Trump call President Xi both an enemy and a friend.	0
Well, the president clearly has no strategy.	0
You know, when I first got into this race, I remember President Trump scoffed and said he'd like to see me making a deal with Xi Jinping.	0
I'd like to see him making a deal with Xi Jinping.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
Is it just me, or was that supposed to happen in, like, April?	0
It's one more example of a commitment not made.	0
When that happens on the international stage, people take note, not just our competitors, our adversaries, but also our allies take note of the inability of the United States to keep its word or follow through on its plans.	0
And when that happens, there are serious consequences.	0
We saw it at the G7.	0
The leaders of some of the greatest powers and economies of the world sitting to talk about one of the greatest challenges in the world, climate change, and there was literally an empty chair where American leadership could have been.	0
The problem is, this is a moment when American leadership is needed more than ever, whether it's in Hong Kong, where those protesters for democracy need to know that they have a friend in the United States, or anywhere around the world where increasingly we see dictators throwing their weight around.	0
The world needs America, but it can't be just any America.	0
Would you repeal the tariffs?	0
I would have a strategy that would include the tariffs as leverage, but it's not about the tariffs.	0
Look, what's going on right now is a president who has reduced the entire China challenge into a question of tariffs, when what we know is that the tariffs are coming down on us more than anybody else and there's a lack of a bigger strategy.	0
Senator Klobuchar, you've actually supported the tariffs on steel.	0
What we've got right now, though, George, it's not a focused tariff on steel.	0
What he has done here, he has assessed these tariffs on our allies.	0
He has put us in the middle of this trade war and he is treating our farmers and our workers like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos.	0
And if we are not careful, he is going to bankrupt this country.	0
One forecast recently says that it has already cost us 300,000 jobs, all right?	0
There is soybeans that are mounting up in bins all over the Midwest, in my state of Minnesota and in Iowa.	0
So what I think we need to do is to go back to the negotiating table -- that's what I would do.	0
I wouldn't have put all these tariffs in place.	0
And I wouldn't have had a trade policy where on August 1st he announces he's going to have tariffs on $300 billion of goods, on August 13th, he cuts it in half, a week later, he says he's going to reduce taxes, the day after that, he says he's going to do it.	0
The leaders of the world are watching this, and it undermines our strength as a nation.	0
And, yes, we want fair trade, but we must work with the rest of the world.	0
And he has made a mockery of focused trade policy, which I think means enforcement, like we've done in northern Minnesota, passing bills, getting President Obama to do more on that, so that our workers can benefit, so we are importing, exporting goods and making sure that it's a competitive policy where our goal is that we are making things, inventing things, and exporting to the world.	0
He is defeating that goal.	0
Secretary Castro, you actually, in one of the previous debates, identified China as the most serious national security threat to our country.	0
I want to pick up on what Senator Klobuchar was saying.	0
She said she would go back to the negotiating table.	0
The question is, what do you do for leverage?	0
Where do you get it?	0
Well, look, I agree with those who have said that this erratic, haphazard trade war is hurting American families.	0
As Senator Klobuchar said, 300,000 American jobs.	0
It's estimated that it's cost $600 to the average American family.	0
Just a couple of days ago, 60 percent of Americans said that they believe that we're in for a recession next year.	0
So when I become president, I would immediately begin to negotiate with China to ratchet down that trade war.	0
We have leverage there.	0
I also believe, though, that we need to return to a leader when it comes to things like human rights.	0
We have millions of Uighurs, for instance, in China that right now are being imprisoned and mistreated.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And in North Korea, this president is elevating a dictator.	0
We need to stop that.	0
We need to return to ensuring that America leads again on human rights.	0
When it comes to this trade war, I would immediately begin ratcheting that trade war down.	0
We have leverage in that discussion.	0
Senator Warren, let me bring you in on this conversation.	0
President Obama signed the Trans-Pacific Partnership.	0
In part, it was designed to rein in China, to bring China into some kind of regulation.	0
What do you think he got wrong?	0
So our trade policy in America has been broken for decades, and it has been broken because it works for giant multinational corporations and not for much of anyone else.	0
These are giant corporations that, shoot, if they can save a nickel by moving a job to a foreign country, they'll do it in a heartbeat.	0
And yet for decades now, who's been whispering in the ears of our trade negotiators?	0
Who has shaped our trade policy?	0
It's been the giant corporations.	0
It's been their lobbyists and their executives.	0
The way we change our trade policy in America is, first, the procedures.	0
Who sits at the table?	0
I want to negotiate trade with unions at the table.	0
I want to negotiate it with small farmers at the table.	0
I want to negotiate it with environmentalists at the table.	0
I want to negotiate with human rights activists at the table.	0
And you asked the question about leverage.	0
If I can just respond to that one, the leverage, are you kidding?	0
Everybody wants access to the American market.	0
That means that we have the capacity to say right here in America, you want to come sell goods to American consumers?	0
Then you got to raise your standards.	0
You've got to raise your labor standards.	0
You've got to raise your environmental standards...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... so our companies can compete on a level playing field.	0
We can use trade not to undermine American workers and not to undermine American farms and not to undermine small businesses in this country.	0
We can use trade to help build a stronger economy.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Harris, how would your trade policy differ from President Obama's?	0
Well, first of all, I have no criticism of that more than just looking at where we are now, which is we've got a guy in the White House who has been erratic on trade policy.	0
He conducts trade policy by tweet, frankly born out of his fragile ego.	0
It has resulted in farmers in Iowa with soybeans rotting in bins, looking at bankruptcy.	0
When we look at this issue, my trade policy, under a Harris administration, is always going to be about saying, we need to export American products, not American jobs.	0
And to do that, we have to have a meaningful trade policy.	0
I am not a protectionist Democrat.	0
Look, we need to sell our stuff.	0
And that means we need to sell it to people overseas.	0
That means we need trade policies that allow that to happen.	0
You asked earlier about China.	0
It's a complicated relationship.	0
We have to hold China accountable.	0
They steal our products, including our intellectual property.	0
They dump substandard products into our economy.	0
They need to be held accountable.	0
We also need to partner with China on climate and the crisis that that presents.	0
We need to partner with China on the issue of North Korea.	0
I am on -- and I think the only person on this stage -- the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Homeland Security Committee.	0
We need a partner on the issue of North Korea.	0
But the bottom line is this.	0
"Donald Trump in office on trade policy, you know, he reminds me of that guy in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" you know, when you pull back the curtain, it's a really small dude?"	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
OK.	0
I'm not even going to take the bait, Senator Harris.	0
But I am going to take...	0
Oh, George, it wasn't about you.	0
I'm going to take this to Senator Sanders right now.	0
Well, there is a reason -- there is a reason why, in the last 45 years, the average American today, despite an explosion of technology and worker productivity, is not making a penny more than he or she made 45 years ago.	0
And one of the reasons is that, for decades, we have had disastrous trade policies.	0
I got to say to my good friend, Joe Biden, Joe and I strongly disagree on trade.	0
I helped lead the opposition to NAFTA and PNTR, which cost this country over 4 million good-paying jobs.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And what happened is people who had those jobs ended up getting other jobs making 50 percent of what they made in manufacturing.	0
So Trump, obviously, hasn't a clue.	0
Trump thinks that trade policy is a tweet at 3 o'clock in the morning.	0
What we have got to do is develop a trade policy that represents workers, represents the farmers in the Midwest and elsewhere, who are losing billions right now because of Trump's policy, a trade policy which understands that if a company shuts down in America and goes abroad, and then thinks they're going to get online to get a lucrative federal contract, under Bernie Sanders, they got another guess coming.	0
Vice President Biden, he invoked your name.	0
Yeah, well, look, we're either going to make policy or China's going to make the rules of the road.	0
We make up 25 percent of the world economy.	0
We need another 25 percent to join us.	0
And I think Elizabeth -- Senator Warren is correct.	0
At the table has to be labor and at the table have to be environmentalists.	0
The fact of the matter is, China -- the problem isn't the trade deficit, the problem is they're stealing our intellectual property.	0
The problem is they're violating the WTO.	0
They're dumping steel on us.	0
That's a different issue than whether or not they're dumping agricultural products on us.	0
In addition to that, we're in a position where, if we don't set the rules, we, in fact, are going to find ourselves with China setting the rules.	0
And that's why you need to organize the world to take on China, to stop the corrupt practices that are underway.	0
Senator Booker, close out this round.	0
Sure.	0
There's one point we're really missing on the stage right now, which is the fact that Donald Trump's America first policy is actually an America isolated, an America alone policy.	0
Exactly right.	0
From trade to battling China to the global crisis of climate change, the challenges in the Middle East, he is pulling us away from our allies, out of the Iran deal, out of the Paris climate accords.	0
And on trade, he's deciding to take on China, while at the same time taking on tariff battles with all of our allies.	0
You literally have him using a national security waiver to put tariffs on Canada.	0
Now, look, I'm the only person on this stage that finds Trudeau's hair very menacing, but they are not a national security threat.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
We cannot go up against China alone.	0
This is a president that has a better relationship with dictators, like Duterte and Putin, than he does with Merkel and Macron.	0
We are the strongest nation on the planet Earth, and our strength is multiplied and magnified when we stand with our allies in common cause and common purpose.	0
That's how we beat China.	0
That's how we beat climate change on the planet Earth, and that's how American values are the ones that lead on issues of trade and workers' rights.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
David?	0
George, thank you.	0
I want to turn now to our troops overseas and to America's longest war in Afghanistan.	0
U.S. talks with the Taliban are dead, according to the president.	0
Secret talks at Camp David have been canceled before they could happen.	0
Many of you have weighed in on that already, so I want to move past that tonight to what all of you have promised on the campaign trail.	0
Many of you on this stage have said you'd bring the troops home in your first term.	0
Others have said in your first year.	0
Senator Warren, we all know the presidency is much different from the campaign trail.	0
President Obama wanted to bring the troops home.	0
President Trump promised to bring the troops home.	0
And you have said of Afghanistan, let's help them reach a peace settlement.	0
It is time to bring our troops home, in your words, starting right now.	0
Would you keep that promise to bring the troops home starting right now with no deal with the Taliban?	0
Yes.	0
And I'll tell you why.	0
What we're doing right now in Afghanistan is not helping the safety and security of the United States.	0
It is not helping the safety and security of the world.	0
It is not helping the safety and security of Afghanistan.	0
We need to bring our troops home.	0
And then we need to make a big shift.	0
We cannot ask our military to keep solving problems that cannot be solved militarily.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We're not going to bomb our way to a solution in Afghanistan.	0
We need to treat the problem of terrorism as a worldwide problem, and that means we need to be working with all of our allies, our European allies, our Canadian allies, our Asian allies, our allies in Africa and in South America.	0
We need to work together to root out terrorism.	0
It means using all of our tools.	0
It means economic investment.	0
It means expanding our diplomatic efforts instead of hollowing out the State Department and deliberately making it so we have no eyes and ears in many of these countries.	0
We need a foreign policy that is about our security and about leading on our values.	0
Senator Warren, a quick follow on that, because top U.S. leaders, military leaders on the ground in Afghanistan told me you can't do it without a deal with the Taliban.	0
You just said you would, you would bring them home.	0
What if they told you that?	0
Would you listen to their advice?	0
I was in Afghanistan with John McCain two years ago this past summer.	0
I think it may have been Senator McCain's last trip before he was sick.	0
And I talked to people -- we did -- we talked to military leaders, American and local leaders, we talked to people on the ground and asked the question, the same one I ask on the Senate Armed Services Committee every time one of the generals comes through: Show me what winning looks like.	0
Tell me what it looks like.	0
"And what you hear is a lot of, ""Uh,"" because no one can describe it."	0
And the reason no one can describe it is because the problems in Afghanistan are not problems that can be solved by a military.	0
I have three older brothers who all served in the military.	0
I understand firsthand the kind of commitment they have made.	0
They will do anything we ask them to do.	0
But we cannot ask them to solve problems that they alone cannot solve.	0
We need to work with the rest of the world.	0
We need to use our economic tools.	0
We need to use our diplomatic tools.	0
We need to build with our allies.	0
And we need to make the whole world safer, not keep troops bombing in Afghanistan.	0
Senator Warren, thank you.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I do want to stay on this, and I want to turn to Mayor Buttigieg, because you're the only veteran on this stage.	0
You served in Afghanistan.	0
"We heard in recent days from General Joseph Dunford, the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who said in recent days, ""I'm not going to use the word withdrawal right now."	0
"It's our judgment the Afghans need support to deal with the level of violence."""	0
If he's not even using the word withdrawal, would you put your promise to bring troops home in the first year on hold to follow the advice?	0
You know, I served under General Dunford, way under General Dunford, in Afghanistan.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
And today, September 12, 2019, means that today you could be 18 years old, old enough to serve, and had not been alive on 9/11.	0
We have got to put an end to endless war.	0
And the way we do it is see to it that that country will never again be used for an attack against our homeland, and that does not require an open-ended commitment of ground troops.	0
Let me say something else, because if there's one thing we've learned about Afghanistan, from Afghanistan, it's that the best way not to be caught up in endless war is to avoid starting one in the first place.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And so when I am president, an authorization for the use of military force will have a built-in three-year sunset.	0
Congress will be required to vote and a president will be required to go to Congress to seek an authorization.	0
Because if our troops can summon the courage to go overseas, the least our members of Congress should be able to do is summon the courage to take a vote on whether they ought to be there.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
By the way, we also have a president right now who seems to treat troops as props, or worse, tools for his own enrichment.	0
We saw what's going on with flights apparently being routed through Scotland just so people can stay at his hotels?	0
I'll tell you, as a military officer, the very first thing that goes through your mind, the first time you ever make eye contact with somebody that you are responsible for in uniform, is do not let these men and women down.	0
This president is doing exactly that.	0
I will not.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Mayor Buttigieg, thank you.	0
I want to turn to Vice President Biden, because the concerns about any possible vacuum being created in Afghanistan, if you pulled the U.S. troops out, has been heightened by what we've seen in recent days on the ground in Iraq.	0
When you were vice president, President Obama turned to you to bring the troops home from Iraq.	0
"You have said on the campaign trail, quote, ""I made sure the president turned to me and said, Joe, get our combat troops out of Iraq."""	0
There was a major drawdown of U.S. troops, and then ISIS seized by some estimates 40 percent of the territory in Iraq.	0
You then had to send thousands of troops back in.	0
Was it wrong to pull out of Iraq that quickly?	0
And did the move actually help ISIS take hold?	0
No, it wasn't wrong to pull out.	0
But I want to answer your Afghanistan question.	0
I've been in and out of Afghanistan, not with a gun, and I admire my friend for his service.	0
But I've been out of Afghanistan I think more than anybody on this -- and it's an open secret, you reported a long time ago, George, that I was opposed to the surge in Afghanistan.	0
The whole purpose of going to Afghanistan was to not have a counterinsurgency, meaning that we're going to put that country together.	0
It cannot be put together.	0
Let me say it again.	0
It will not be put together.	0
It's three different countries.	0
Pakistan owns the three counties -- the three provinces in the east.	0
They're not any part of -- the Haqqanis run it.	0
I will go on and on.	0
But here's the point.	0
The point is that it's a counterterrorism strategy.	0
We can prevent the United States from being the victim of terror coming out of Afghanistan by providing for bases -- insist the Pakistanis provide bases for us to air lift from and to move against what we know.	0
We don't need those troops there.	0
I would bring them home.	0
And Joe Dunford's a fine guy, but this has been an internal argument we've had for eight years.	0
With regard to -- with regard to Iraq, the fact of the matter is that, you know, I should have never voted to give Bush the authority to go in and do what he said he was going to do.	0
The AUMF was designed, he said, to go in and get the Security Council to vote 15-0 to allow inspectors to go in to determine whether or not anything was being done with chemical weapons or nuclear weapons.	0
And when that happened, he went ahead and went anyway without any of that proof.	0
I said something that was not meant the way I said it.	0
I said -- from that point on -- what I was argued against in the beginning, once he started to put the troops in, was that in fact we were doing it the wrong way; there was no plan; we should not be engaged; we didn't have the people with us; we didn't have our -- we didn't have allies with us, et cetera.	0
"And it was later, when we came into office, that Barack turned -- the president turned to me and said, ""Joe"" -- when they said we've got a plan to get out, he turned to the whole security and said, ""Joe will organize this."	0
"Get the troops home."""	0
My son spent a year in Iraq, and I understand.	0
It made -- and we were right to get the combat troops out.	0
The big mistake that was made, which we predicted, was that you would not have a circumstance where the Shia and the Kurds would work together to keep ISIS from coming -- from moving in.	0
Mr. Vice President, thank you.	0
I want to turn to Senator Sanders on this.	0
Because the concern over Afghanistan is very similar to what we saw in Iraq when the troops came out.	0
ISIS filled that vacuum.	0
What do you make of people out there who are worried that if we pull out U.S. troops too quickly from Afghanistan, it will create safe haven all over again, like the plotters of 9/11?	0
David, let me answer that, but let me just comment on something that the vice president said.	0
You talked about the big mistake in Iraq and the surge.	0
The truth is, the big mistake, the huge mistake, and one of the big differences between you and me, I never believed what Cheney and Bush said about Iraq...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
You're right.	0
I voted against the war in Iraq	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... and helped lead the opposition.	0
And it's sad to say -- I mean, I, kind of, you know, had the feeling that there would be massive destabilization in that area if we went into that war.	0
As the former chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, I want to pick up on what Pete said.	0
We cannot express our gratitude to all of the men and women who have put their lives on the line to defend them -- defend us, who have responded to the call of duty.	0
But I think, also, I am the only person up here to have voted against all three of Trump's military budgets.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I don't think we have to spend $750 billion a year on the military when we don't even know who our enemy is.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I think that what we have got to do is bring this world together -- bring it together on climate change, bring it together in fighting against terrorism.	0
And make it clear that we as a planet, as a global community, will work together to help countries around the world rebuild their struggling economies and do everything that we can to rid the world of terrorism.	0
But dropping bomb on Afghanistan and Iraq was not the way to do it.	0
Senator Sanders, thank you.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I want to take this to Mr. Yang.	0
You share the stage, as you know, when when we talk about troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, with the vice president, who was in the Situation Room, with senators who were on the Senate Armed Services, the Foreign Relations Committees, with an Afghanistan veteran who is on the stage tonight.	0
As you share the stage with these candidates, what makes you the most qualified on this stage to be commander in chief?	0
I've signed a pledge to end the forever wars.	0
We've been in a state of continuous armed conflict for 18 years, which is not what the American people want.	0
We have to start owning what we can and can't do.	0
We're not very good at rebuilding countries.	0
And if you want proof, all you have to do is look within our own country of Puerto Rico.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We've spent trillions of dollars to unclear benefits, lost thousands of lives -- and thank you, Pete, for your service.	0
And the goal has to be to rebuild the relationships that have made America strong for decades.	0
I would lead our armed forces with restraint and judgment.	0
What the American people want is simply a president who has the right values and point of view and they can trust to make the right decisions when it comes to putting our young men and women into harm's way.	0
And that's what I would do as president.	0
Mr. Yang, thank you.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Jorge?	0
Thank you very much.	0
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH) (ph)	0
You haven't been asked about Latin America in the previous debates, so let's begin.	0
Senator Sanders, one country where many immigrants are arriving from is Venezuela.	0
A recent U.N. fact-finding mission found that thousands have been disappeared, tortured and killed by government forces in Venezuela.	0
You admit that Venezuela does not have free elections, but still you refuse to call Nicolas Maduro a dictator -- a dictator.	0
Can you explain why?	0
And what are the main differences between your kind of socialism and the one being imposed in Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua?	0
Well, first of all, let me be very clear.	0
Anybody who does what Maduro does is a vicious tyrant.	0
What we need now is international and regional cooperation for free elections in Venezuela so that the people of that country can make -- can create their own future.	0
In terms of democratic socialism, to equate what goes on in Venezuela with what I believe is extremely unfair.	0
I'll tell you what I believe in terms of democratic socialism.	0
I agree with goes on in Canada and in Scandinavia, guaranteeing health care to all people as a human right.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I believe that the United States should not be the only major country on earth not to provide paid family and medical leave.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I believe that every worker in this country deserves a living wage and that we expand the trade union movement.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I happen to believe also that what, to me, democratic socialism means, is we deal with an issue we do not discuss enough, Jorge -- it's not in the media and not in Congress.	0
You've got three people in America owning more wealth than the bottom half of this country.	0
You've got a handful of billionaires controlling what goes on in Wall Street, the insurance companies and in the media.	0
Maybe, just maybe, what we should be doing is creating an economy...	0
Thank you.	0
... that works for all of us, not 1 percent.	0
That's my understanding of democratic socialism.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Secretary, you wanted to say a quick response -- 45 seconds?	0
Sure, thank you, Jorge.	0
I'll call Maduro a dictator, because he is a dictator.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And what we need to do is to, along with our allies, make sure that the Venezuelan people get the assistance that they need, that we continue to pressure Venezuela so that they'll have free and fair elections, and also, here in the United States, offer temporary protected status, TPS, to Venezuelans.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
That is something that the Trump administration has failed to do.	0
For all of his big talk about supporting the Venezuelan-American community, he has failed.	0
I will not.	0
I also believe that we need to do things like a 21st century Marshall plan for Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... so that people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of having to make the dangerous journey to the United States.	0
And under my administration, we're going to put renewed focus on Latin America.	0
It makes sense.	0
They're our neighbors and we have a lot of things in common.	0
It also makes sense that, because we have a country like China that is going around the world to places like Africa and Latin America, making their own relationships, strengthening those, the United States needs to strengthen its partnerships in Latin America immediately.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
And I will	0
Senator Booker, let me ask you about Brazil.	0
After the recent fires in the Amazon, some experts suggested that eating less meat is one way to help the environment.	0
You are a vegan since 2014.	0
That's obviously a personal choice, but President Trump and Brazil's President Bolsonaro are concerned that climate change regulations could affect economic growth.	0
So should more Americans, including those here in Texas, and in Iowa...	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
... follow your diet?	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
Um (ph), you know, first of all, I want to say no.	0
Actually, I want to translate that into Spanish.	0
No.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Look, on -- let's just be clear.	0
The factory farming going on that's assaulting this corporate consolidation of the agricultural industry, one of the reasons why I have a bill to put a moratorium on this kind of corporate consolidation is because this factory farming is destroying and hurting our environment.	0
And you see independent family farmers being pushed out of business because of the kind of incentives we are giving that don't line up with our values.	0
That's what I'm calling for.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
But I want to -- I want to switch, because we don't have -- a crowded debate stage, we were talking about Afghanistan and Iraq.	0
It annoys me that we had a conversation about our troops overseas and we didn't say one word about veterans in our country.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We have a shameful reality in America that we send people off to war and they often come home with invisible wounds, hurts and harms.	0
They're disproportionately homeless.	0
You hear stories about women waiting for months for gynecological care through the VA.	0
It is very important that, as we -- as a country, understand that we are not going to solve every problem with this outrageous increased militarism, that we also make sure that we stand up for the people that stood for us.	0
"We end our national anthem with ""home of the brave."""	0
It's about time we make this a better home for our bravest.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
Congressman O'Rourke, Hurricane Harvey hit this town two years ago.	0
And not only is the Amazon burning, Greenland is melting at a record pace.	0
The last five years have been the hottest ever recorded.	0
And we have a viewer's question about this.	0
What meaningful action will you take to reverse the effect of climate change?	0
And can we count on you to follow through if your donors are against it?	0
Yes, we will follow through, regardless of the political consequences or who it offends, because this is the very future of our planet and our ability for our children and grandchildren to be able to survive on it.	0
We will make sure that we get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than the year 2050.	0
That we are halfway there by 2030.	0
That we mobilize $5 trillion over the next 10 years to do that.	0
That we invest here in Houston, Texas, with pre-disaster mitigation grants to protect those communities that are vulnerable to flooding given the fact that this town has seen three 500-year floods in just five years, you'd like to think you're good for 1,500 years, but you're not.	0
They're coming faster and larger and more devastating than ever.	0
We're also going to make sure that we free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels and embrace renewable wind and solar energy technology, as well as the high-paying, high-skill, high-wage jobs that come along with that.	0
And that we're going to pay farmers for the environmental services they want to provide.	0
Planting cover crops, keeping more land under conservation, using no-till farming, regenerative agriculture can pull carbon out of the air and can drive it and sequester it into the soil.	0
That's the way that we're going to meet this challenge and we're going to bring everyone into the solution.	0
Many of you want to comment.	0
Let's see if we can go very fast.	0
Senator Klobuchar?	0
Thank you.	0
This is the existential crisis of our time.	0
"It's -- you know that movie ""The Day after Tomorrow""?"	0
It's today.	0
We have seen a warming in our world like never before.	0
We're seeing flooding in the Midwest, flooding in Houston, fires in the West.	0
And I think having someone leading the ticket from the Midwest will allow us to talk about this in a different way and get it done.	0
On day one, I will get us back into the international climate change agreement.	0
On day two, I will bring back the clean power rules that President Obama had worked on.	0
On day three, I will bring back the gas mileage standards.	0
You can do all that without Congress, which is good.	0
On day four, five, and six I will, working with Congress and mayors and business people all over the country, introduce sweeping legislation to get at that 2050 goal.	0
And on day seven, you're supposed to rest, but I won't.	0
This is what we need to do if we're going to get at climate change.	0
We have to take this on as a crisis that's happening right now.	0
Senator Warren, should American foreign policy be based around the principle of climate change?	0
Yes.	0
We need to work on every front on climate change.	0
It is the threat to every living thing on this planet and we are running out of time.	0
Every time the scientists go back, they say, we have less and less time than we thought we had.	0
But that means we've got to use all the tools.	0
One of the tools we need to use are our regulatory tools.	0
I have proposed following Governor Inslee, that we, by 2028, cut all carbon emissions from new buildings.	0
By 2030, carbon emissions from cars.	0
And by 2035, all carbon emissions from the manufacture of electricity.	0
That alone, those three, will cut our emissions here in the United States by 70 percent.	0
We can do this.	0
We also need to help around the world to clean, but understand this one more time.	0
Why doesn't it happen?	0
As long as Washington is paying more attention to money than it is to our future, we can't make the changes we need to make.	0
We have to attack the corruption head-on so that we can save our planet.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Harris, 45 seconds.	0
When I think about this issue, it really is through the lens of my baby nieces who are one-and-a-half and three years old.	0
When I look at what is going to be the world if we do nothing, when they turn 20, I am really scared.	0
And when I've been in the United States Senate for now the last two-and-a-half years and I look at our counterparts, the Republicans in the United States Senate, they must be looking at their children and then when they look at the mirror, I don't know what they see, but it's a lack of courage.	0
And this is an issue that, yes, it represents a existential threat.	0
It is also something that we can do something about.	0
This is a problem that was created by human behaviors.	0
And we can change our behaviors in a way that saves our planet.	0
I've seen it happen in California.	0
I took on -- as the attorney general of California, I ran the second-largest department of justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice.	0
I took on the big oil companies and we saw progress.	0
If any of you have been to Los Angeles, 20 years ago, you'll remember, that sky was brown.	0
You go there now, the sky is blue and you know why?	0
Because leaders decided to lead and we took on these big fossil fuel companies.	0
We have some of the most important and strongest laws in the country and we made a difference.	0
And my point being, I've done it before and I will lead as president on this issue because we have no time, the clock is ticking, but we need courage, and we need courageous leadership.	0
We can get this done.	0
Mr. Yang?	0
So, to follow up on what Elizabeth said, why are we losing to the fossil fuel companies?	0
Yes.	0
Why are we losing to the gun lobby and the NRA?	0
And is answer is this, we all know, everyone on this stage knows that our government has been overrun by money and corporate interests.	0
Now, everyone here has a plan to try to curb those corporate interests, but we have to face facts.	0
Money finds a way.	0
Money will find its way back in.	0
So, what is the answer?	0
The answer is to wash the money out with people-powered money.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
"My proposal is that we give every American 100 ""Democracy Dollars"" that you can only give to candidates and causes that you like."	0
This would wash out the lobbyist cash by a factor of eight to one.	0
That is the only way we will win.	0
And as someone running for president, I'll tell you, there's the people on one side and the money on the other, the only way for us to win is if we bring them together.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Mr. Yang.	0
Linsey.	0
I'd like to have an academic discussion now about education.	0
Mr. Yang, we'll stay with you.	0
Here in Houston, the school district is facing yet another year of spending cuts.	0
Like schools across the country, the system faces many challenges.	0
One of them, thousands of students are leaving traditional public schools and going to charter schools.	0
You're the most vocal proponent on this stage for charter schools.	0
"You have said that Democrats who want to limit them are, quote, ""just jumping into bed with teachers unions and doing kids a disservice."""	0
Why isn't taxpayer money better spent on fixing traditional public schools?	0
Let me be clear, I am pro-good school.	0
I've got a kid, one of my little boys just started public school last week and I was not there because I was running for president.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
So, we need to pay teachers more, because the data clearly shows that a good teacher is worth his or her weight in gold.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We need to lighten up the emphasis on standardized tests, which do not measure anything fundamental about our character or human worth.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
But here's the big one.	0
The data clearly shows that 65 to 70 percent of our students outcomes are determined outside of the school.	0
We're talking about time spent at home with the parents, words read to them when they're young, stress levels in the house, income, type of neighborhood.	0
We're putting money into schools, and educators know this, we're saying you're 100 percent responsible for educating your kids but you can only control 30 percent.	0
They all know this.	0
The answer is to put money directly into the families and neighborhoods to give our kids a chance to learn and our teachers a chance to teach.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Mayor Buttigieg, 45 seconds to respond.	0
Step one is appoint a secretary of education who actually believes in public education.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I believe in public education.	0
And in order to strengthen it, some things are very complex, for preparing for a future where knowledge is at your fingertips, but we have got to teach more to do with critical thinking and social and emotional learning.	0
Some of it is extremely simple, we have just got to pay teachers more.	0
And we have got to lift up the teaching profession.	0
I always think of a story from South Bend of friends who hosted exchange students from Japan.	0
They had a student one year who wanted to be a teacher.	0
And they kept in touch with her when she went back to Japan and to college.	0
She took the exam to try to become a teacher in a society that really regards teachers and compensates teachers well.	0
And she came up just short.	0
So, you know what she did?	0
Since she was academically good but couldn't quite make the cut to be a teacher, she had a fall-back plan, she became a doctor.	0
That is how seriously some countries treat the teaching profession.	0
If we want to get the results that we expect for our children, we have to support and compensate the teaching profession.	0
Respect teachers the way we do soldiers and pay them more like the way we do doctors.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Warren, to use Mr. Yang's term, are you just jumping into bed with teachers unions?	0
You know, I think I'm the only person on this stage who has been a public school teacher.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I had wanted to be a public school teacher since I was in second grade.	0
And let's be clear in all the ways we talk about this, money for public schools should stay in public schools, not go anywhere else.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I've already made my commitment.	0
I will -- we will have a secretary of education who has been a public school teacher.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I think this is ultimately about our values.	0
I have proposed a two-cent wealth tax on the top one-tenth of one percent in this country.	0
That would give us enough money to start with our babies by providing universal child care for every baby age zero to five, universal pre-K for every three-year-old and four-year-old in this country...	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
... raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in this country, cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of the folks who've got it...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
... and strengthen our unions.	0
This is how we build an America that reflects our values, not just where the money comes from with the billionaires and corporate executives.	0
Senator Harris, 45 seconds to respond.	0
My first grade teacher, Mrs. Frances Wilson (ph), God rest her soul, attended my law school graduation.	0
I think most of us would say that we are not where we are without the teachers who believed in us.	0
I have offered in this campaign a proposal to deal with this, which will be the first in the nation, federal investment, in closing the teacher pay gap, which is $13,500 a year.	0
Because right now, in our public schools, our teachers, 94 percent of them are coming out of their own pocket to help pay for school supplies.	0
And that is wrong.	0
I also want to talk about where we are here at TSU, and what it means in terms of HBCUs.	0
I have, as part of my proposal that we will put $2 trillion into investing in our HBCUs for teachers, because...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Because -- because, one, as a proud graduate of a historically black college and university, I will say -- I will say that it is our HBCUs that disproportionately produce teachers and those who serve in these may professions, but also...	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
But this is a critical point, if a black child has a black teacher before the end of third grade, they're 13 percent more likely to go to college.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
If that child has had two black teachers before the end of third grade, they're 32 percent more likely to go to college.	0
So, when we talk about investing in our public education system, it is at the source of so much.	0
When we fix it, that will fix so many other things.	0
We must invest in the potential of our children...	0
Thank yo, Senator.	0
Senator Sanders, 45 seconds.	0
... and I strongly believe you can judge a society based on how it treats its children.	0
And we are failing on this issue.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Guess what?	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
You're guessing, all right, here's the answer.	0
We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world.	0
And yet, we have the highest child poverty rate of almost any country on earth.	0
We have teachers in this country who are leaving education because they can't work two or three jobs to support themselves.	0
Which is why, under my legislation, we'll move to see that every teacher in America makings at least $60,000 a year.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
What we will also do is not only have universal pre-K, we will make public colleges and universities and HBCUs debt-free.	0
And what we will always also do, because this is an incredible burden on millions and millions of young people who did nothing wrong except try to get the education they need, we are going to cancel all student debt in this country.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
And we are going to do that by imposing a tax on Wall Street speculation.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Mr. Vice president, I want to come to you and talk to you about inequality in schools and race.	0
"In a conversation about how to deal with segregation in schools back in 1975, you told a reporter, ""I don't feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather, I feel responsible for what the situation is today, for the sins of my own generation, and I'll be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago."""	0
You said that some 40 years ago.	0
But as you stand here tonight, what responsibility do you think that Americans need to take to repair the legacy of slavery in our country?	0
Well, they have to deal with the -- look, there's institutional segregation in this country.	0
And from the time I got involved, I started dealing with that.	0
Red-lining banks, making sure that we are in a position where -- look, you talk about education.	0
I propose that what we take is those very poor schools, the Title I schools, triple the amount of money we spend from 15 to $45 billion a year.	0
Give every single teacher a raise, the equal raise to getting out -- the $60,000 level.	0
Number two, make sure that we bring in to help the teachers deal with the problems that come from home.	0
The problems that come from home, we need -- we have one school psychologist for every 1,500 kids in America today.	0
It's crazy.	0
The teachers are -- I'm married to a teacher.	0
My deceased wife is a teacher.	0
They have every problem coming to them.	0
We have -- make sure that every single child does, in fact, have 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds go to school.	0
School.	0
Not daycare.	0
School.	0
We bring social workers in to homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children.	0
It's not want they don't want to help.	0
They don't -- they don't know quite what to do.	0
Play the radio, make sure the television -- excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the -- the -- make sure that kids hear words.	0
A kid coming from a very poor school -- a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time they get there.	0
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.	0
There's so much we -- no, I'm going to go like the rest of them do, twice over, OK?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Because here's the deal.	0
The deal is that we've got this a little backwards.	0
And by the way, in Venezuela, we should be allowing people to come here from Venezuela.	0
I know Maduro.	0
I've confronted Maduro.	0
Number two, you talk about the need to do something in Latin America.	0
I'm the guy that came up with $740 million to see to it those three countries, in fact, changed their system so people don't have to chance to leave.	0
You're all acting like we just discovered this yesterday.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Secretary Castro?	0
Thank you very much.	0
Well, that's -- that's quite a lot.	0
(OFF-MIKE)	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
But, you know -- I grew up in one of those neighborhoods that folks have talked about and a neighborhood that was grappling with the legacy of segregation.	0
In fact, in two public school districts that were involved in a 1973 Supreme Court case challenging how Texas financed its schools.	0
And I know that today our schools are segregated because our neighborhoods are segregated.	0
Now, I have an education plan, like a lot of folks up here, that would pay teachers more, that would recruit diverse ranks of teachers, that would invest in our public schools, but I also believe that we have to connect the dots to uplift the quality of life to invest in housing opportunity, to invest in job opportunity, to invest in community schools that offer resources like parents able to go back and get their GED, and health care opportunities, and those things that truly ensure that the entire family can prosper.	0
Those are the types of things that we need to do, in addition to lifting up our public schools.	0
You asked a second ago about charter schools.	0
Look, it is a myth that charter schools are better than public schools.	0
They're not.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Secretary.	0
And so while I'm not categorically against charter schools, I would require more transparency and accountability from them than is required right now.	0
Senator Booker, coming to you now.	0
It was 65 years ago this year that the Supreme Court outlawed racial segregation in public schools.	0
Yet for millions of students of color today, segregation remains a reality.	0
Nonwhite districts typically receive $2,200 less per student than those in white districts.	0
This means older books, less access to computers, and often worse outcomes.	0
What is your plan to address segregation?	0
And I'm not just talking about the achievement gap, but I'm talking about the opportunity gap in education.	0
So, I'm hearing a lot of conversations on the stage that -- and the way we talk about communities of color.	0
Look, I live in a black and brown community below the poverty line.	0
I've lived in public housing projects almost for a decade and saw the anguish of parents who are just so deeply frustrated that they don't have a school that serves their genius.	0
I think I'm the only person on the stage -- even though I had no formal authority as mayor to run a school system -- I stepped up and took responsibility for our schools, and we produced results.	0
A lot of folks here are talking about raising teacher salary.	0
We actually did it in Newark, New Jersey.	0
And we didn't stop there.	0
Yeah, we closed poor-performing charter schools, but, dagnabbit, we expanded high-performing charter schools.	0
We were a city that said we need to find local solutions that work for our community.	0
The results speak for themselves.	0
We're now the number-one city in America for Beat the Odds schools, from high poverty to high performance.	0
Strategies like investing in our children work.	0
And I'll tell you this.	0
I am tired of us thinking about these problems isolated, disconnected from other issues.	0
That's why my friend, Secretary Castro, is 100 percent right.	0
We are in the reality we are right now because, Mr. Vice President, of overtly racist policies, not 400 years ago, just in my lifetime, that were red-lining communities, disinvesting in communities, and more than just that, my kids are not only struggling with racial segregation and housing and the challenges of underfunded schools, but they're also struggling with environmental injustice.	0
If you've talked to someone who's a parent of a child has had permanent brain damage because of lead, you'll know this is a national problem, because there's over 3,000 jurisdictions in America where children have more than twice the blood lead levels of Flint, Michigan.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
And so if I'm president of the United States, it is a holistic solution to education, from raising teacher salary, fully funded special education, but combatting the issues of poverty, combatting the issues of racial segregation, combatting the issues of a criminal justice system...	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
... that takes parents away from their kids, and dealing with environmental justice as a major pillar of any climate policy.	0
Thank you, Linsey.	0
One final question coming up.	0
We'll be right back.	0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
And we are now back now for a final round of questions.	0
One question for each candidate.	0
We're going to go in reverse order from the opening statement.	0
And, candidates, the question is on the quality of resilience.	0
No president can succeed without resilience.	0
Every president confronts crises, defeats, and mistakes.	0
So I want to ask each of you, what's the most significant professional setback you've had to face?	0
How did you recover from it?	0
And what did you learn from it?	0
Vice President Biden?	0
I -- I never counted any professional setback like I have as a serious setback.	0
There's things that are important.	0
Things that are unimportant.	0
(OFF-MIKE)	0
We're going to clear the protesters now.	0
Just one minute.	0
Senator Biden, we'll start the clock again.	0
(OFF-MIKE)	0
I'm sorry.	0
We're sorry.	0
Go ahead.	0
There's setbacks, and there's setbacks.	0
And I think the most critical setback that can occur to anyone is to lose -- well, my dad had an expression.	0
He said, Joey, it's not a question of succeeding, whether you get knocked down, it's how quickly you get up.	0
And he said, you never explain and never complain.	0
And then he would go on to say that the only obligation that really matters, the most important thing, is family.	0
And so I was raised to believe that that was the center of everything, family, and could be judged on based how you treatment your family and how you went from there.	0
And I -- it took -- you know, Kierkegaard said faith sees best in the dark.	0
Right after I got elected, my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident, and my two sons were badly injured.	0
And I just had been elected, not sworn in.	0
And I lost my faith for a while.	0
I came back.	0
And then later, when my son Beau came home from Iraq and -- with a terminal disease, and a year later, year-and-a-half later, losing him was like losing part of my soul.	0
But the fact is that I learned that the way you deal with it is you deal with finding purpose, purpose in what you do.	0
And that's why I hope -- I hope he's proud of me today, because he wanted to make sure I didn't run for president, but I stayed engaged, because when you get hit badly, whether you're losing a job or you're raising a family like my dad, where you have to make that longest walk up the stairs to tell your kid you can't live here anymore, Dad lost his job, you know, we've all been through that, in some form or another.	0
And it just takes -- it just -- for me, the way I've dealt with it is finding purpose.	0
And my purpose is to do what I've always tried to do and stay engaged in public policy.	0
And -- but there's a lot of people been through a lot worse than I have who get up every single morning, put their feet one foot in front of another, without the help I had.	0
There are real heroes out there.	0
Some real heroes.	0
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.	0
Senator Warren?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I mentioned earlier, I've known what I wanted to be since second grade.	0
I wanted to be a public school teacher.	0
And I invested early.	0
I used to line my dollies up and teach school.	0
I had a reputation for being tough but fair.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
By the time I graduated from high school, my family didn't have money for a college application, much less to send me off to four years at a university.	0
And my story, like a lot of stories, has a lot of twists and turns.	0
Got a scholarship, and then at 19, I got married, dropped out of school, took a minimum wage job, thought my dream was over.	0
I got a chance down the road at the University of Houston.	0
And I made it as a special needs teacher.	0
I still remember that first year as a special needs teacher.	0
I could tell you what those babies looked like.	0
I had 4- to 6-year-olds.	0
But at the end of that first year, I was visibly pregnant.	0
And back in the day, that meant that the principal said to me -- wished me luck and hired someone else for the job.	0
So, there I am, I'm at home, I got a baby, I can't have a job.	0
What am I going to do?	0
Here's resilience.	0
I said, I'll go to law school.	0
And the consequence was -- I practiced law for about 45 minutes and then went back to my first love, which was teaching.	0
But it let me get into fights.	0
It gave me new tools.	0
And the reason I'm standing here today is because I got back up, I fought back.	0
I know what's broken.	0
I want to be in the fight to fix it in America.	0
That's why I'm here.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Sanders?	0
Resilience, to me, means growing up in a rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York, the son of an immigrant who came to this country without a nickel in his pocket.	0
Professional resilience means to me, George, running for U.S. Senate in Vermont and getting 1 percent of the vote, running for governor and getting 2 percent of the vote, finally becoming mayor of Burlington, Vermont, with a 10-vote margin.	0
What resilience means to me is that throughout my political career, I have taken on virtually every powerful special interest in this country, whether it is Wall Street, whether it is the insurance industry, whether it is the pharmaceutical industry whose corruption and greed is killing people today, whether it is a military industrial complex or a prison industrial complex.	0
And I feel confident that given a lifelong record of taking on powerful special interests, of standing up for the working families of this country, that I will be able to take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite and create a government and an economy that work for all of us, not just the 1 percent.	0
Thank you, Senator Sanders.	0
Senator Harris?	0
You know, every office I've run for, whether it be district attorney or attorney general, I was told each time, it can't be done.	0
They said nobody like you has done it before, nobody's ready for you.	0
When I ran for D.A., I won and became the first black woman elected D.A.	0
in a state of 40 million people, in San Francisco.	0
When I ran for attorney general of California, I was elected -- because I didn't listen.	0
And I was the only black elected -- woman black elected attorney general in the state -- in the country.	0
And each time, people would say, it's not your time, it's not your turn, it's going to be too difficult, they're not ready for you, and I didn't listen.	0
And a part of it probably comes from the fact that I was raised by a mother who said many things that were life lessons for me, including don't you let anybody ever tell you who you are.	0
You tell them who you are.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And when I look around the town halls that we do in this race for president of the United States, and I look at the -- the meetings that we do and the community meetings, and I see these little girls and boys, sometimes even brought by their fathers, and they bring them to me and I talk to them during these events, and they smile and they're full of joy, and their fathers tell them, see, don't you ever listen and let anybody ever tell you what you can or cannot be.	0
You have to believe in what can be unburdened by what has been.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Harris, thank you very much.	0
Mayor Buttigieg?	0
"You know, as a military officer serving under ""don't ask/don't tell,"" and as an elected official in the state of Indiana when Mike Pence was governor, at a certain point, when it came to professional setbacks, I had to wonder whether just acknowledging who I was, was going to be the ultimate career-ending professional setback."	0
I came back from the deployment and realized that you only get to live one life.	0
And I was not interested in not knowing what it was like to be in love any longer, so I just came out.	0
I had no idea what kind of professional setback it would be, especially because inconveniently it was an election year in my socially conservative community.	0
What happened was that, when I trusted voters to judge me based on the job that I did for them, they decided to trust me and re-elected me with 80 percent of the vote.	0
And what I learned was that trust can be reciprocated and that part of how you can win and deserve to win is to know what's worth more to you than winning.	0
And I think that's what we need in the presidency right now.	0
We have to know what we are about.	0
And this election is not about any of us up here.	0
It is not about this president, even though it's hard to talk of anything else some days.	0
It's about the people who trust us with their lives, a kid wondering if we're actually going to make their schools safe when they've learned active shooter drills before they've learned to read, a generation wondering we will actually get the job done on climate change.	0
And if we hold to that, then it doesn't matter what happens to each of us professionally.	0
Together, we will win a better era for our country.	0
Mayor Buttigieg, thank you.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Mr. Yang?	0
I was an unhappy lawyer for five whole months and I left to start a business.	0
And I'm going to share with you all one of the secrets to entrepreneurship.	0
If you want to start something, tell everyone you know you're going to do it.	0
And then you don't have a choice.	0
You put your heart and soul into that.	0
And even though I did that, my company flopped, had its mini-rise and maximum fall.	0
I lost investors, hundreds of thousands of dollars, still owed $100,000 in school debt.	0
My parents still told people I was a lawyer.	0
It was a little easier.	0
So I remember lying on my floor looking up wondering, how did it come to this?	0
Eventually, I picked myself back up.	0
I kept working in small growth companies for another 10 years and eventually had some success.	0
Then after I did have some success, I still remembered how hard it was, how isolating it was, how it feels like your friends no longer want to spend time with you.	0
And so I spent seven years starting and running a nonprofit that helped train young entrepreneurs around the country, including Sean Nguyen (ph), who's here in the audience tonight, who left his gilded Wall Street job to become a food entrepreneur in San Antonio.	0
Sean, I hope I made the process a little bit easier for you than it was for me.	0
But the goal of my campaign is to make this an economy that allows us to live our human values and aspirations.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, Mr. Yang.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Booker?	0
So my biggest professional setback is embarrassing because a lot of folks know about it.	0
I, with a bunch of tenant leaders in Newark, New Jersey, in 2002 took on the political machine and, boy, did they fight back.	0
I had tires on my car slashed.	0
Our campaign offices were broken into.	0
My phones were tapped.	0
It became a spectacle.	0
And we lost that election.	0
And here's a bit of advice to everybody.	0
"If you're going to have a spectacular failure, have a documentary team there to capture it, because it made for an Oscar-nominated documentary called ""Street Fight."""	0
But then, unfortunately, another setback.	0
"It lost in the Oscars to a movie called ""March of the Dagnab Penguins,"" for crying out loud."	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
The people in my community, living in the projects, told me, don't give up on the people and the people won't give up on you.	0
Create bigger and bolder coalitions, and you're going to win.	0
And you know what?	0
We came back four years later and won the largest lopsided victory in our city's history.	0
But more than that, the lesson was there.	0
We didn't give up.	0
We were taking on America's toughest problems, from crime to poverty, and we transformed our city, creating tens of thousands of new jobs, the biggest economic expansion in our city, and as I said before, turned around our school system.	0
There's more work to do, but I haven't given up on the people.	0
I still live in that community.	0
But this is a big lesson.	0
My staff and my friends and my community told me, if you want to go fast, you may have won the mayor's race, but that's not what life is about.	0
There's an old African saying that says, if you want to go fast, go alone.	0
But if you want to go far, go together.	0
The lesson I learned of resilience is to trust people, because the power of the people is always greater than the people in power.	0
And the test of America right now is not a referendum on Donald Trump, it's a referendum on us and who we are and who we're going to be together.	0
We need to use this moment in history to unite in common cause and common purpose, and then there's nothing we can't do together as a nation.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Booker, thank you.	0
Congressman O'Rourke?	0
Thank you, George.	0
Everything that I've learned about resilience I've learned from my hometown of El Paso, Texas.	0
In the face of this act of terror that was directed at our community, in large part by the president of the United States, that killed 22 people and injured many more, we were not defeated by that, nor were we defined by that.	0
The very thing that drew that killer to us is the very thing that helps us set the example for the rest of this country.	0
We don't see our differences as disqualifying or dangerous.	0
We see them as foundational to our success, to our strength, and to our security, and to our safety.	0
Yesterday, I was visiting with one of those victims.	0
He's the head coach of the Fusion.	0
This is a girls soccer team of 10- and 11-year-old girls.	0
His name is Luis.	0
He was shot in the legs multiple times.	0
He was shot in the side multiple times.	0
He's still healing from his wounds in the hospital, but from his hospital bed, he's still trying to coach the Fusion girls soccer team.	0
Memo, his co-coach, is still fighting for his life right now at Del Sol Hospital.	0
Those two men, Jessica and Marcella (ph), their wives, they exemplify resilience to me.	0
And when we end this scourge of gun violence in this country, when we finally confront the racism that exists in America, when we're defined not by our fears, but instead by our aspirations and our ambitions, it will be, in large part, I think, thanks to the example that El Paso has set.	0
Congressman, thank you.	0
Senator Klobuchar?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you.	0
My challenges and resilience have brought me up here.	0
I grew up with a dad who struggled with alcoholism his whole life.	0
And after his third DWI, he had a choice between jail and treatment.	0
He chose treatment, with his faith, with his friends, with our family.	0
And in his words, he was pursued by grace.	0
And that made me interested in public service, because I feel like everyone should have that same right, to be pursued by grace.	0
I then got married.	0
My husband's out there somewhere, hopefully smiling, and our daughter.	0
When our daughter was born, I had this expectation, we're going to have this perfect, perfect birth, and she was really sick, and she couldn't swallow.	0
And she was in and out of hospitals for a year-and-a-half.	0
But when she was born, they had a rule in place that you got kicked out of the hospital in 24 hours.	0
She was in intensive care, and I was kicked out.	0
And I thought, this could never happen to any other mom again.	0
So I went to the legislature, our state legislator, not an elected official, a mom, and I advocated for one of the first laws in the country guaranteeing new moms and their babies a 48-hour hospital stay.	0
And when they tried to delay the implementation of that law, I brought six pregnant friends to the conference committee so they outnumbered the lobbyists 2 to 1.	0
And when they said, when should it take place, they all raised their hands and said now.	0
That is what motivated me to go into public service.	0
And when I got to that gridlock of Washington, D.C., I got to work and pass over 100 bills, and I know a lot of my friends here from the left, but remember, I am from the middle of the country.	0
And I believe, if we're going to get things done, that we have to have someone leading the ticket with grit, someone who's going to not just change the policies, but change the tone in the country, and someone who believes in America and believes it from their heart because of where they came from, that everyone should have that same opportunity.	0
Senator, thank you.	0
Secretary Castro?	0
And thank you, George, to Jorge, to Linsey, and to David, and to all of y'all for tuning in tonight.	0
In many ways, I shouldn't be here on this stage.	0
You know, Castro is my mother's name and was my grandmother's name before her.	0
I grew up in a single-parent household on the west side of San Antonio, going to the public schools.	0
Eventually, my brother, Joaquin, and I became the first in our family to become professionals.	0
And when I got home, I took a job at the biggest law firm in town.	0
I was making $100,000 a year in the year 2000.	0
A few months later, I got elected to the San Antonio City Council.	0
And the city council at the time was only paying $1,040 a year, so everybody had another job.	0
And my job was at the law firm.	0
Well, a few months after I got elected, the law firm got a client and the client wanted those of us on the city council to vote for a land deal.	0
The land deal was that they wanted to build a golf course over our water supply, because we relied on an underground aquifer.	0
I didn't think the environmental protection plan was strong enough, so I wanted to vote against it and my constituents wanted me to vote against it.	0
But under the ethics rules for lawyers in Texas -- because believe it or not, lawyers have ethics rules -- you can't just go against the interest of a client.	0
So I was stuck.	0
On the one hand, I wanted to do the right thing.	0
On the other hand, my livelihood, my student loans, my new house payment, my car payment, depended on me shutting up, being conflicted out.	0
So, one day, I walked into my law firm and I quit my job.	0
And then I went and I voted against that land deal on the city council.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And, you know, it was the first test that I had, and I think back to that, because oftentimes we think of politics and you think of politics as dirty or corrupting.	0
I wondered, before I went in it, whether it was change who I was.	0
And I was proud that when that first test came that I stood up for the people that I was there to represent, and not for big special interests.	0
There's nobody that gets tested more in a position of public trust than the president of the United States.	0
This president has failed that test.	0
But I want you to know that if you elect me president, I won't.	0
I won't serve anybody except you and your family.	0
And together, we can create an American that's better than ever.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Thank you, Secretary Castro.	0
Thank you to all of our candidates.	0
It was a great debate.	0
I think we learned a lot tonight thanks to you.	0
Thanks to Texas Southern University for hosting us tonight.	0
It was a great crowd, as well, tonight, thanks to you.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thanks to everyone at home.	0
The debate is over.	0
Our coverage continues with Tom Llamas.	0
END	0
Good evening, and welcome to the fabulous FOX Theatre in downtown Detroit, the site of the 11th Republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign.	0
I'm Megyn Kelly, along with my co-moderators, Bret Baier and Chris Wallace.	0
59 Republican delegates are at stake here in the state of Michigan during next Tuesday's Republican primary, the biggest prize out of four states holding contests that day.	0
For tonight's debate we're partnering with Facebook.	0
The conversation about this election has been intense, as the crowd is here.	0
Since January 1st, 53 million people in the U.S. have been talking about the election on Facebook.	0
Tonight there are just four candidates on this stage.	0
Their position has been determined by their standing in an average of the five most recent national polls as recognized by FOX News, and conducted and released by March 1st.	0
Here they are.	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
Texas Senator, Ted Cruz.	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
Florida Senator, Marco Rubio.	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
And, Ohio Governor, John Kasich.	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
Tonight's rules are simple.	0
Up to 60 seconds for each answer, 30 seconds for each follow-up response, and if a candidate goes over the allotted time, you will hear this.	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
So pleasant.	0
Really.	0
We have a big crowd here, and while we expect the audience to be enthusiastic and responsive at times...	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
... they may have already been — we also expect them to be respectful, and we want the candidates to get their full time.	0
So, somewhere between a library and a Red Wings game.	0
[ laughter and cheering ]	0
Am I right?	0
Is that OK?	0
Let's get started.	0
Mr. Trump, as you may have heard, the 2012 Republican nominee for President, Mitt Romney, had some things to say about you today.	0
He said your domestic policy will lead to recession, he's said your foreign policy will make us less safe, and then he listed what he said are your personal qualities.	0
"Quoting now Romney on Trump, quote, ""the bullying, the greed, the showing off, the misogyny, the absurd, third-grade theatrics""."	0
[ cheering ]	0
He challenged you to answer with substance, not insults.	0
How do you answer Mitt Romney, sir?	0
Well look, he was a failed candidate, he should have beaten president Obama very easy.	0
He failed miserably, and it was an embarrassment to everybody, including the Republican party.	0
It looked like he went away on a vacation the last month.	0
So, I don't take that, and I guess, obviously, he wants to be relevant.	0
He wants to be back in the game.	0
As far as domestic policy and trade which is killing our country, he said free trade and I believe in free trade also.	0
But, if you look at China, and you look Japan, and if you look at Mexico, both at the border, by the way, where they're killing us.	0
Both at the border, and with trade — and every other country we do business with we are getting absolutely crushed on trade.	0
And, he said free trade, I say free trade great.	0
But, not when they're beating us so badly.	0
With China we're going to lose $505 billion dollars in terms of trades.	0
You just can't do it.	0
Mexico, $58 billion dollars.	0
Japan, probably about, they don't know it yet, but about $109 billion dollars.	0
Every country we lose money with.	0
As far as I'm concerned, we've got to reduce — we have to redo our trade deals 100 percent.	0
I have the greatest business people in the world lined up to do it.	0
We will make...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
... great trade deals.	0
[ cheering ]	0
Mr. Trump, Romney also talked about your position on race, and the controversy over your failure to denounce David Duke on Sunday.	0
You have repeatedly disavowed him since then, but I'd like to go deeper than that.	0
What are your views on the Klu Klux Klan, and white supremacists?	0
I totally disavow the Klu Klux Klan.	0
I totally disavow David Duke.	0
I've been doing it now for two weeks, this is your — you're probably about the 18th person that's asked me the question.	0
It was very clear, that question was also talked about in the form of groups.	0
Groups, I want to know which groups are you talking about?	0
You have to tell me which groups?	0
Ultimately, he got to the Klu Klux Klan, which obviously I'm going to disavow.	0
And, by the way, if you look on my Twitter account, almost immediately after the program they were disavowed again.	0
You know, it's amazing.	0
When I do something on Twitter, everybody picks it up, goes all over the place.	0
But, when I did this one nobody ever picks it up.	0
Take a look at my Twitter account.	0
Thank you, sir.	0
Thank you.	0
Thanks.	0
[ applause ]	0
"Senator Rubio, three weeks ago you said, quote: ""I don't do the personal attacks, primarily because it's not who I am, because I think it's beneath the office that I'm seeking but also because I don't want to embarrass my kids."""	0
But in the past week you've mocked Mr. Trump's tan.	0
You've made fun of his spelling.	0
You called him a con artist.	0
You suggested he wet himself backstage at the last debate, along with other vulgar jokes and jabs.	0
So what happened?	0
Yes, you know, Bret, let me say something.	0
This campaign for the last year Donald Trump has basically mocked everybody with personal attacks.	0
He has done so to people that are sitting on the stage today.	0
He has done so about people that are disabled.	0
He has done it about every candidate in this race.	0
So if there is anyone who has ever deserved to be attacked that way, it has been Donald Trump, for the way he has treated people in the campaign.	0
Now that said, I would much prefer to have a policy debate.	0
I hope that's what we will have here tonight.	0
Let's have a policy debate...	0
And we will.	0
... let's talk about Donald Trump's strategy and my strategy and Ted's strategy and John Kasich's strategy when it comes to ISIS.	0
And on health care and on the important issues facing this country.	0
But let's be honest too about all this.	0
The media has given these personal attacks that Donald Trump has made an incredible amount of coverage.	0
Let's start talking again about the issues that matter to this country.	0
I'm ready to do that starting right here right now tonight.	0
Mr. Trump, your response?	0
Well, I also happened to call him a lightweight, OK?	0
And I have said that.	0
So I would like to take that back.	0
He is really not that much of a lightweight.	0
And as far as — and I have to say this, I have to say this.	0
He hit my hands.	0
Nobody has ever hit my hands.	0
I have never heard of this.	0
Look at those hands.	0
Are they small hands?	0
[ laughter ]	0
And he referred to my hands, if they are small, something else must be small.	0
I guarantee you there is no problem.	0
I guarantee.	0
OK. Moving on.	0
OK, Senator Cruz, you say that you are the true conservative in this race.	0
But 15 states have voted now, and you have won only four of them.	0
You have lost repeatedly with what is supposed to be your core voter groups, including evangelicals and conservatives.	0
Hasn't your brand of conservatism been rejected by an electorate that appears to be more taken with Mr. Trump's populist message?	0
Well, Megyn, you know, at the end of the day for the folks at home, this is not about the insults back and forth between the candidates.	0
This is not about what attacks we can throw at each other.	0
This is the people at home who are struggling through seven years of Barack Obama.	0
This is the single moms who are working two and three jobs, 28, 29 hours a week because their hours have been forcibly reduced because of Obamacare.	0
This is the truck drivers and the steel workers and the mechanics with calluses on their hands who have seen their wages not grow year after year after year while the cost of living goes up.	0
This is all the young people coming out of school with student loans up to their eyeballs that aren't able to find a job.	0
And I don't think the people of America are interested in a bunch of bickering school children.	0
They are interested in solutions, not slogans.	0
It's easy to say, make things better, make things great.	0
You can even print it and put it on a baseball cap.	0
But the question is, do you understand the principles that made America great in the first place?	0
As president, I will repeal every word of Obamacare.	0
I will pull back the regulators that are killing small businesses.	0
And we will pass a simple flat tax and abolish the IRS.	0
And what that's going to do, Megyn, is small businesses are going to explode.	0
We are going to see millions of high-paying jobs.	0
We are going to see wages going up.	0
We are going to see opportunity.	0
That's where our focus needs to be.	0
That's where my focus is.	0
And that is why our campaign is the only campaign that over and over again has beaten Donald Trump to date, and it's why we are the one campaign that going forward can and will beat Donald Trump in this election.	0
Go ahead, Mr. Trump.	0
I have heard Ted say that over and over again on television, that he is the only one that can beat me.	0
Just, for the record, I have won 10.	0
He has won three or four.	0
Last week, in fact, on Tuesday, I was a half a million votes higher than him.	0
I was a million votes higher than Marco, 1 million votes.	0
That's a lot of votes.	0
And was by far in first place.	0
So I keep hearing that he is the only one that can beat me but he is getting beaten very, very badly.	0
So where does this come from?	0
Where does it come from?	0
Go ahead, Senator Rubio.	0
Yes, I would just say a couple of things.	0
There is no doubt that Donald has done well in these elections.	0
There is no doubt about that.	0
The numbers are there.	0
Here is what the numbers also say.	0
Two-thirds of the people who have cast a vote in a Republican primary or caucus have voted against you.	0
They do not want you to be our nominee.	0
And, the reason why is because we are not going to turn over the conservative movement, or the party of Lincoln or Reagan, for example, to someone whose positions are not conservative.	0
To someone who last week defended Planned Parenthood for 30 seconds a debate stage.	0
To someone, for example, that has no ideas on foreign — someone who thinks the nuclear triad is a rock band from the 1980's.	0
Oh yeah, you're...	0
... To someone who time and again on issue after issue has not proven that he has the principals...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
... That outline what the conservative movement has been about.	0
And, as Ted said, the things that made America great.	0
America is great because of the conservative principles of limited government and free enterprise, and a strong national defense...	0
... OK...	0
... And, our nominee needs to be someone that stands by those things...	0
... Alright...	0
... Donald has not demonstrated that.	0
... Go ahead, Mr. Trump, and then we're going to have to go to Governor Kasich.	0
[ applause ]	0
Very nice words, but happens to be wrong.	0
CNN just came out with a poll two days ago that...	0
...	0
[ inaudible ]	0
... That national poll — excuse me...	0
...	0
[ inaudible ]	0
...	0
The national poll — a national poll where he's at 15, he's at 14...	0
...	0
[ inaudible ]	0
...	0
... And, I'm at 49, so when he says 75 percent, that would mean that 80 percent of the people don't dig you, and I'm back down to 50...	0
... Of all the people on this stage, he performs the worst against Hillary Clinton.	0
Wrong...	0
...	0
If you're our nominee, we will lose...	0
...	0
I beat Hillary Clinton.	0
I beat Hillary Clinton in many polls...	0
... You lose by	0
[ inaudible ]	0
points.	0
She will wipe you out.	0
I beat Hillary Clinton in many polls...	0
If you're our nominee	0
[ inaudible ]	0
...	0
...	0
Hold on, Senator, hold on...	0
...	0
I think I'm talking...	0
... Oh, excuse me	0
[ inaudible ]	0
...	0
...	0
I beat Hillary Clinton...	0
...	0
Hold on, hold on, hold on...	0
...	0
I hope you think	0
[ inaudible ]	0
...	0
...	0
The audience cannot understand when you're talking over each other.	0
Finish your point, Mr. Trump.	0
...	0
I beat Hillary Clinton in many polls.	0
The Cue poll just came out.	0
I beat Hillary Clinton in a recent Fox poll, I beat Hillary Clinton in USA Today, I beat her today in a poll in Ohio.	0
I beat — I'm the only one that beats Hillary Clinton.	0
I beat — and I have not started on Hillary yet.	0
Believe me, I will...	0
[ cheering ]	0
... start soon.	0
I haven't even started.	0
OK.	0
Governor Kasich, today you admitted that you have a narrow path to the nomination through a contested convention.	0
Today also Mitt Romney proposed that Republicans should vote for Senator Rubio in Florida.	0
They should vote for you in Ohio.	0
They should vote for Senator Cruz in states that he can beat Mr. Trump to prevent Mr. Trump from getting the nomination.	0
So, do you buy Romney's blueprint, and can you say tonight to your Florida supporters that they should vote for Senator Rubio to get a contested convention?	0
You know, this so much about process.	0
It frankly is boring to me.	0
I would like it clear though, since we're talking about polls, I beat Hillary Clinton by more than 11 points, and the reason it happens...	1
[ cheering ]	1
...	0
In one poll...	0
...	0
The reason it happens...	0
...	0
In one poll...	0
... You know, the reason is because, as the Democrats tell me all the time, I can get the crossover votes.	0
You see, because throughout this campaign I've talked about issues, I have never tried to go and get into these scrums that we're seeing here on the stage.	0
"And, people say everywhere I go, ""you seem to be the adult on the stage."""	0
[ applause ]	0
In terms of — you know, Mitt Romney's a great guy, but he doesn't determine my strategy.	0
The fact of the matter is I'm running for president because I worked hard to fix this country when I was in Washington as the Chairman of the Budget Committee where we had some of the most significant job growth after we balanced the budget.	0
We had wages going up, it was very successful in Ohio.	0
Our wages grow faster than the national average.	0
We're up over 400,000 jobs.	0
We paid down, back in the old days, they paid down half a trillion dollars of the national debt.	0
It's a formula that works.	0
And, I believe that formula will work when I return to Washington as the president.	0
And, by the way, I won't need on the job training because I know how to do all of this, and within the first 100 days I will have a plan that will pass the Congress because...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...	0
It is reasonable, and I can bring both sides together...	0
[ applause ]	0
...	0
But Governor, this is all about process.	0
For voters, they need to see a path to get to the nomination if they're going to support you.	0
On Super Tuesday you finished in single digits in nine out of 11 states.	0
So, you can see that your path is through a contested convention.	0
How do you...	0
... Well, Bret, I think we're all really there.	0
I mean, the simple fact is that, you know, you all wrote me off.	0
You wrote me off before I even got to New Hampshire, then when I finished in New Hampshire you wrote me off in the South, then you wrote me off in Super Tuesday.	0
I split delegates in Vermont with Donald Trump, I finished second in Massachusetts, and we won delegates in Virginia.	0
But, guess what?	0
It's now March Madness and we're heading up North to the place — to my turf, OK?	0
[ cheering ]	0
And, let me just tell you this, I will win Ohio, and I am going to move all across this country, and over time as people begin to finally hear my message — you know what people say, Bret, to me all the time?	0
Why don't they give you any time on the debate stage?	0
Why is that?	0
[ cheering ]	0
So now all of a sudden, I'm starting to get it, and what I want the people to know is, I know how to bring people together, Republicans and Democrats.	0
I have successfully, both at the federal level and the state level brought economic growth, wage growth, and economic security to this country.	0
And I want to go back and do it again, and I'm going to keep talking about my message of bringing people together and motivating people in the neighborhoods that realize they don't need somebody from Washington galloping in.	0
There are many things they can do where they live, because the strength of our country is in our neighborhoods and our families.	0
And I'm going to keep doing this.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you.	0
Well, then, we want to focus now on the economy, which is one of the top issues on Facebook, with 6.6 million people discussing it online.	0
A lot of that conversation is happening here in Detroit, where the unemployment rate is 10.9 percent.	0
That's more than double the national average.	0
"Senator Rubio, you have taken to calling Mr. Trump a con artist who portrays himself as a hero to working people while he's really been, in your words, ""sticking it"" to the American workers for 40 years."	0
But he has built a big company that employs thousands of people.	0
Question.	0
How many jobs have you created?	0
Well, first of all, government doesn't...	0
[ audience booing ]	0
First of all, Chris, my point is exactly right.	0
He has spent a career of convincing Americans that he's something that he's not in exchange for their money.	0
Now he's trying to do the same in exchange for their country.	0
This is a fact.	0
He talks about these great businesses that he's built.	0
He inherited over $100 million.	0
Wrong.	0
Wrong.	0
And with that money, he lost more money than he made.	0
Mr. Trump, it's not your turn.	0
You'll get your turn, sir.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
He can start tonight by announcing that all the Donald Trump clothing will no longer be made in China and in Mexico, but will be made here in the United States.	0
[ applause ]	0
And on the issue of job creation, I find this interesting.	0
The private sector creates jobs.	0
The jobs of those of us in public service are to put in place policies that allow the economy to grow.	0
That's the problem with the Democratic Party.	0
They think government is what creates jobs.	0
Government does not create jobs.	0
Now, the way you create jobs is you make America the easiest and the best place in the world to start a business or to expand an existing business.	0
If you go on my website, marcorubio.com, you will see a real plan to fix our taxes, to roll back regulations, to repeal and replace Obamacare, not just lines around the states.	0
Serious policies and proposals.	0
Sir?	0
Mr. Trump, I'd like you to respond.	0
You have 30 seconds to respond.	0
But as part of that, could you respond to his specific assertion about Trump Collection clothes, which you say some of it is made in Mexico?	0
This little guy has lied so much...	0
Here we go.	0
... about my record.	0
Here we go.	0
It's personal.	0
[ audience booing ]	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
He has lied so much about my record.	0
Mr. Rubio — Senator Rubio, why don't you let him finish?	0
And I will tell you this.	0
First of all, I got a call from my sister and brother tonight, and they said we had no idea Dad gave you $200 million.	0
Believe me, I started off with $1 million.	0
I built a company that's worth more than $10 billion.	0
And I say it not in a bragging way, but that's the kind of thinking we need.	0
Very low debt, tremendous cash flow.	0
My financials are all — they're all in there with the federal elections.	0
You've seen them.	0
Everybody has seen them.	0
I say it only because that's the kind of thinking this country needs with $19 trillion in debit.	0
Believe me.	0
[ applause ]	0
But wait one second.	0
Specifically and quickly on the question, will you promise that you will — and how soon will you move your clothing collection, the clothes that are made in China and Mexico?	0
They devalue their currencies.	0
I will do that.	0
And by the way, I have been doing it more and more.	0
But they devalue their currencies, in particular China.	0
Mexico is doing a big number now, also.	0
Japan is unbelievable what they're doing.	0
They devalue their currencies, and they make it impossible for clothing-makers in this country to do clothing in this country.	0
And if you look at what's happened on Seventh Avenue, and you look at what's happened in New York with the garment industry, so much of the clothing now comes out from Vietnam, China, and other places.	0
And it's all because of devaluation.	0
By the way, the Trans-Pacific, if you look at the TPP, a total disaster, which, by the way, Marco is in favor of, they need — it is a disaster for our country.	0
It's trying to be approved by various people, including President Obama.	0
And I'll tell you something.	0
The biggest problem with that is: They don't take into concurrence the devaluation.	0
They're devaluing their currency.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, Mr. Trump.	0
Senator Rubio?	0
And they're killing — they're going to...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Wait, wait, Senator Rubio.	0
The answer is, he's not going to do it.	0
And you know why?	0
Because there are plenty of clothing makers in America.	0
[ applause ]	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
If you go on my website, marcorubio.com, everything we have on there is made in America.	0
The reason why he makes it in China or Mexico is because he can make more money on it.	0
That's why he's doing it.	0
And the second point, you see what happens, again, when you challenge him on a policy issue.	0
You asked him about the economy, and the first thing he does is launch an attack about some little guy thing.	0
Because he doesn't have answers.	0
No, no.	0
I have very good answers.	0
And he's asking us to make him the president of the United States of America.	0
[	0
crosstalk ]	0
[ applause ]	0
This is not a game.	0
I know what's happening with the economy.	0
You don't know a thing.	0
Well, then answer the economy question.	0
You haven't employed in your life one person.	0
But he doesn't answer the employment question.	0
I have employed tens of thousands of people.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
You haven't employed one person.	0
You ever heard of Trump Steaks?	0
You ever heard of Trump Vodka?	0
Oh, you know what?	0
You know what?	0
Take a look at Trump Steaks.	0
All of these companies he has ruined.	0
By the way, that's the other thing...	0
Trump Steaks is gone.	0
You have ruined these companies.	0
Mitt Romney...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
... false, totally false.	0
And now the funny thing is he didn't talk about the hundreds of really successful jobs, the buildings all over the world that have made a fortune.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
I have a policy question for you, sir.	0
Let's see if he answers it.	0
I will.	0
Don't worry about it, Marco.	0
Don't worry about it.	0
Don't worry about it little Marco, I will.	0
All right, well, let's hear it big Donald.	0
Don't worry about it, little Marco.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Gentlemen.	0
Gentlemen.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
You have got to do better than this.	0
This guy has a number one — the number one absentee record in the United States...	1
Mr. Trump, I would like to ask you a policy question.	0
He doesn't show up to vote.	0
Your proposed tax cut...	0
That's why the people in Florida do not like him.	0
Mr. Trump, your proposed tax cut would add $10 trillion to the nation's debt over 10 years, even if the economy grows the way that you say it will.	0
You insist that you could make up for a good deal of that, you say, by cutting waste, fraud, and abuse.	0
Correct.	0
Like what?	0
And please be specific.	0
Department of Education.	0
We're cutting Common Core.	0
We're getting rid of Common Core.	0
We're bringing education locally.	0
Department of Environmental Protection.	0
We are going to get rid are of it in almost every form.	0
We're going to have little tidbits left but we're going to take a tremendous amount out.	0
We have various other things.	0
If you look at the IRS, if you look at every single agency, we can cut it down, and I mean really cut it down and save.	0
The waste, fraud, and abuse is massive.	0
Larry Kudlow, great guy, everybody respects him, said my plan for taxes and tax cutting is the best by far of everybody.	0
But, Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, your numbers don't add up.	0
Please put up full screen number four.	0
The Education Department, you talk about cutting, the total budget for the education department is $78 billion.	0
And that includes Pell grants for low-income students and aid to states for special education.	0
I assume you wouldn't cut those things.	0
The entire budget for the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, $8 billion.	0
OK.	0
The deficit this year is $544 billion.	0
That's more than a half trillion dollars.	0
Your numbers don't add up, sir.	0
Let me explain something.	0
Because of the fact that the pharmaceutical companies — because of the fact that the pharmaceutical companies are not mandated to bid properly, they have hundreds of billions of dollars in waste.	0
We don't bid properly.	0
We don't have proper bidding procedures.	0
The reason we don't is because they take care of all of the senators, all of the congressman, and they don't bid.	0
They don't go out to bid.	0
Mr. Trump...	0
Take a look — excuse me.	0
You are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars...	0
No, you are not.	0
... if we went out to the proper bid.	0
Of course you are.	0
No, you're not, sir.	0
Let's put up full screen number 2.	0
You say that Medicare could save $300 billion a year negotiating lower drug prices.	0
But Medicare total only spends $78 billion a year on drugs.	0
Sir, that's the facts.	0
You are talking about saving more money on Medicare prescription drugs...	0
I'm saying saving through negotiation throughout the economy, you will save $300 billion a year.	0
But that doesn't really cut the federal deficit.	0
And that's a huge — of course it is.	0
We are going to buy things for less money.	0
Of course it is.	0
That works out...	0
That's the only money that we buy — the only drugs that we pay for is through Medicare.	0
I'm not only talking about drugs, I'm talking about other things.	0
We will save $300 billion a year if we properly negotiate.	0
We don't do that.	0
We don't negotiate.	0
We don't negotiate anything.	0
Can I...	0
No.	0
I promise I will get to you in a moment, sir.	0
Senator Cruz, one of centerpieces of your campaign, in fact, you mentioned it again tonight, is that you will abolish the IRS.	0
Question though, who will collect the taxes that you are still calling for?	0
Who will oversee to make sure that people pay the taxes that they rightfully owe?	0
And who will check on the various tax deductions and tax credits that you still want?	0
So my simple flat tax I have rolled out in precise detail how it will operate where every American can fill out our taxes on a postcard.	0
And if you want to actually see the postcard, see all the details, you can find them on our Web site.	0
It's tedcruz.org.	0
When he we get rid of all the corporate welfare, all the subsidies, all the carve-outs in the IRS code, it dramatically simplifies it.	0
And under Obama, the IRS has become so corrupt and so politicized we need to abolish it all together.	0
Now, at the end of that there will still be an office in the Treasury Department to receive the postcards but it will be dramatically simpler.	0
And let me take a moment, Chris, to go back to go back to this exchange that was going on.	0
In between all of the insults, let me point out the specificity that was lacking.	0
"It's very easy to say, ""Let's cut waste, fraud, and abuse."""	0
I've rolled out a detailed plan to cut $500 billion in federal spending, specifying exactly what I would cut.	0
[ applause ]	0
It's easy to say it, but one of the great disconnects to all the people, all of the voters, I understand the folks who are supporting Donald right now.	0
You're angry.	0
You're angry at Washington, and he uses angry rhetoric.	0
But for 40 years, Donald has been part of the corruption in Washington that you're angry about.	0
[ applause ]	0
And you're not going to stop the corruption in Washington by supporting someone who has supported liberal Democrats for four decades, from Jimmy Carter to John Kerry to Hillary Clinton.	0
You're not going to stop the corruption and the cronyism by supporting someone who has used government power for private gain.	0
Instead, we need a president who stands with the American people.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Kasich, I promise I will get to you.	0
But you do get 30 seconds to respond, Mr. Trump.	0
Well, all of a sudden, I hear for 40 years I've been involved in Washington.	0
I have been supporting people for many years.	0
And these people have been politicians, and they've been on both sides, Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives.	0
I've supported everybody, because, until recently, I wasn't a politician, and I hope maybe you don't all consider me a politician right now.	0
I hate the term politician.	0
But I've been supporting politicians.	0
A recent article somewhere said Donald Trump is a world-class businessman who goes out and he does get along with everybody.	0
I've supported Democrats, and I've supported Republicans.	0
And as a businessman, I owed that to my company, to my family, to my workers, to everybody to get along.	0
Part of the problem we have in Washington, Chris...	0
Mr. Trump...	0
... is it's total gridlock.	0
Nobody gets along.	0
We need people to get along.	0
We need to be able to get things done.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Kasich, Democrats, as you know, will make income inequality a big issue in the general election.	0
You support raising the minimum wage, although you say not to the $15 an hour that Democrats are talking about.	0
Mr. Trump opposes any increase because he says it will price American workers out of the world market.	0
Is he wrong about that?	0
No increase in the minimum wage?	0
Well, well, wait a minute, first of all, I didn't say I was for an increase in the federal minimum wage.	0
I said in Ohio we increased it modestly every single year.	0
So I'm not for a federal minimum wage increase.	0
But you did talk about states doing it.	0
Well, states — if states want to do it, they ought to sit down with businesspeople and the lawmakers and figure out what will work.	0
But hold on a second here with everything else.	0
I'm the only person on this stage who actually was the chief architect of balancing the federal budget.	0
It's not a theory for me.	0
It's not — it's not some — you have to know how to put everything together.	0
And you know, I spent 10 years of my life to get there, and I did not do that because I'm worshiping at some balanced budget shrine.	0
The reason I did it is when you have commonsense regulations, lower taxes on individuals and businesses, and you have a fiscal plan that makes sense, the job creators will expand employment.	0
And what happened?	0
When I was there, the jobs were exploding.	0
Bill Clinton's tried to take credit for it.	0
When I went to Ohio, we're up 400,000 jobs.	0
It's the same formula.	0
But it isn't easy.	0
I fought the entire Washington establishment and won, because when you balance a budget, you must affect every single thing.	0
Everything in the federal government specifically.	0
You cannot get there with theories or broad statements, and you have to be willing to take the heat.	0
In fact, I fought a Republican president, who I thought was not offering constructive proposals to fix this economy.	0
So when we talk about all this, there's one person on this stage and one person who's been a candidate for president in either party that restored economic strength, growth, a balanced budget, paid down debt, cut taxes, the things that people in this country want.	0
No theories.	0
Reality.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
[ applause ]	0
All right.	0
Let's talk immigration for a little bit.	0
Senator Cruz, let's start with you.	0
You have repeatedly touted how you have stood shoulder to shoulder with Senator Jeff Sessions to fight illegal immigration and amnesty.	0
But Senator Sessions just endorsed Donald Trump.	0
If voters want Jeff Sessions-style immigration policies, isn't their choice rather clear?	0
Yes, their choice is very clear.	0
If you look to the actual record — you know, Donald mentioned a moment ago that he was just doing business when he was writing checks to liberal Democrats.	0
But that's not, in fact, the checks he was writing.	0
Listen, we could all understand if you write a check to a city commission because you're looking for a zoning waiver on building a building.	0
That may be corrupt, but you could understand real estate developers doing that.	0
That's not what Donald Trump did.	0
Donald Trump supported Jimmy Carter over Ronald Reagan.	0
Donald supported John Kerry over George W. Bush.	0
If you don't like Obamacare, Donald Trump funded Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi taking over Congress to pass Obamacare.	0
On immigration, if you don't like amnesty, if you don't like the Gang of Eight, Donald Trump funded five of the eight members of the Gang of Eight $50,000.	0
And let's talk about this election.	0
The choice Republican primary voters are making is who is best prepared to stand up to Hillary Clinton and beat Hillary Clinton.	0
Donald Trump has written checks to Hillary Clinton not once, not twice, not three times.	1
Ten times.	1
And four of those checks were not to her Senate campaign.	0
It wasn't that she was the New York senator and it was a cost of doing business.	0
It was to her presidential campaign.	0
Donald Trump in 2008 wrote four checks to elect Hillary Clinton as president.	0
OK.	0
So I'd like to ask Donald, why did you write checks to Hillary Clinton to be president in 2008?	0
It wasn't for business.	0
And how can you stand on a debate stage now with her and say you don't think she should be president?	0
[ applause ]	0
Actually, it was for business.	0
It was.	0
It was.	0
It was for business.	0
I pride myself, including outside of the United States.	0
I'm doing almost 120 deals outside of the — which I hope to be able to stop very soon and let my children handle it — but we're doing many, many deals outside of the United States.	0
I support politicians.	0
In 2008, I supported Hillary Clinton.	0
I supported many other people, by the way.	0
And that was because of the fact that I'm in business.	0
I did support very heavily Ronald Reagan.	0
I also supported George Bush, by the way.	0
All right.	0
Mr. Trump...	0
But what would you say...	0
Well, stand by — stand by, Senator Cruz.	0
... to Hillary Clinton on the debate stage when you wrote her a check in 2008, wrote her four checks to be president?	0
Let me tell you, something, Ted.	0
The last person that Hillary Clinton wants to face is Donald Trump.	0
That I can...	0
[ applause ]	0
Let's move on.	0
And with all due respect, we have — we have questions.	0
We have questions.	0
That I can tell you.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
No, no, no.	0
Hold on.	0
Hold on.	0
We can do more of this later.	0
Mr. Trump, hi.	0
Hello.	0
How are you doing?	0
Nice to be with you, Megyn.	0
Great to have you here.	0
You're looking well.	0
You're looking well.	0
As are you.	0
[ applause ]	0
Back in January, you gave an off-the-record interview to the New York Times.	0
It was apparently audiotaped.	0
Now, a recent report in Buzzfeed citing sources at the Times reports that in that interview you expressed flexibility when it comes to your immigration policy, specifically with respect to your promise to deport the 11 million people who are now living here illegally.	0
You have suggested that you may have expressed some flexibility when it comes to the size of the wall that you want to build.	0
But did you tell them, specifically, that you are flexible when it comes to your deportation plan?	0
I don't know exactly what — when you talk about off the record.	0
First of all, Buzzfeed?	0
They were the ones that said under no circumstances will I run for president.	0
And were they wrong.	0
But a lot of people said that.	0
Then, I did have a meeting with the editorial board of the New York Times, a very nice meeting.	0
Many of those things were off the record, I think at their suggestion and my suggestion.	0
And I think being off the record is a very important thing.	0
I think it's a very, very powerful thing.	0
And I will say this.	0
These three gentlemen have gone off the record many times with reporters.	0
And I think they want to honor it, and I would always honor that.	0
I will say, though, in terms of immigration — and almost anything else — there always has to be some, you know, tug and pull and deal.	0
And, you know, when I watch Ted stand on the Senate floor, I had great respect for what he did.	0
He stood there for a day-and-a- half or something.	0
In the meantime, what came of it?	0
Nothing.	0
You have to be able to have some flexibility, some negotiation.	0
Now, sometimes you ask for more than you want and you negotiate down to the point.	0
I may have discussed something like that with the New York Times, but I would never release off-the-record conversations.	0
I don't think it's fair, frankly, to do that to anybody.	0
How flexible are you on this issue?	0
[ audience booing ]	0
Not very flexible.	0
No, not very flexible.	0
I give the example — I'm going to build a wall.	0
I'm the one that wants the wall.	0
I'm the one that can build the wall.	0
[ applause ]	0
It's going to get built.	0
And by the way, Mexico is going to pay for the wall.	0
I can tell you that.	0
Mexico is going to pay for the wall.	0
[ applause ]	0
But — and I used an example.	0
And this isn't necessarily what was said, but whatever was said, the wall's 50 feet high.	0
Is it going to be 45 feet or 40 feet?	0
That could very well be.	0
That could very well — he wants it to be higher.	0
[ laughter ]	0
That could very well be.	0
But there's always give and take.	0
There's always negotiation.	0
And the best negotiator that knows what he's doing will make a great deal.	0
But we need give and take in government.	0
If you don't have give and take, you're never going to agree on anything.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Rubio, you not only supported the failed immigration reform effort through the Gang of Eight, but you're still on record as favoring an eventual path to citizenship for those who are here illegally.	0
And in addition...	0
[ audience booing ]	0
...you favored in-state tuition for Florida illegal immigrants.	0
You've been hitting Mr. Trump hard on this flexibility discussion with the New York Times, but his supporters might say at least his opening stance was tough.	0
Well, first of all, let me say that on the issue of the off-the-record, that's not up to the New York Times.	0
That's up to you, Donald.	0
If tonight you tell the New York Times to release the audio, they will do it, and we can exactly see what your true views are on immigration...	0
Fine.	0
... because it is a major issue, in your campaign that you've made a center issue.	0
Now, as far as my record on it is concerned, I absolutely want to solve this issue.	0
And I did the best we could in a Senate that was controlled by liberal Democrats and Harry Reid in the hopes that the House, made up of conservatives, would take it up and make it even stronger.	0
And I said that repeatedly at the time.	0
I'm not just saying that now; I said it throughout that process.	0
We do need to do with this issue.	0
[ audience booing ]	0
When I'm president it will not be dealt with the way it was done in the Senate.	0
It will be done first and foremost by bringing illegal immigration under control and proving it to the American people.	0
And only after that is done can anything else happen.	0
And it will be something the American people support.	0
We'll see what they are willing to support.	0
It's not going to be an executive order and we're not going to ram it down their throats.	0
Mr. Trump, we will let respond, but will you release the tapes?	0
Will you authorize of The Times to release the tapes?	0
I will say one thing, what Marco said is — I understand it.	0
He is talking about a little give and take and a little negotiation.	0
And you know what?	0
That's OK. That's not the worst thing in the world.	0
There is nothing wrong with that.	0
I happen to be much stronger on illegal immigration.	0
Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsed me.	0
And if he endorses you, believe me, you are the strongest, from Arizona.	0
But give and take is OK. And I thought what he said is OK. We may differ on the degree.	0
But what he said to me is OK.	0
Will you release the tapes?	0
No.	0
I never do that.	0
I would not do that.	0
I don't think — I have too much respect — if I deal with you off the record, if I deal with Bret or Chris off the record, I have too much respect for that process to say, just release everything.	0
I would not do that.	0
OK.	0
Stand by.	0
We're going to continue this right after the break.	0
We have more.	0
Coming up, more with Megyn on immigration, plus questions on other top issues, including the war on terror.	0
"The ""FOX News Republican Presidential Debate Live from Detroit"" continues after a quick break."	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back everybody to the FOX News Republican presidential debate, live from the FOX theater here in Detroit.	0
Let's get back now to the questions.	0
"Mr. Trump, your campaign website to this day argues that more visas for highly skilled workers would, quote, ""decimate American workers""."	0
However, at the CNBC debate, you spoke enthusiastically in favor of these visas.	0
So, which is it?	0
I'm changing.	0
I'm changing.	0
We need highly skilled people in this country, and if we can't do it, we'll get them in.	0
But, and we do need in Silicon Valley, we absolutely have to have.	0
So, we do need highly skilled, and one of the biggest problems we have is people go to the best colleges.	0
They'll go to Harvard, they'll go to Stanford, they'll go to Wharton, as soon as they're finished they'll get shoved out.	0
They want to stay in this country.	0
They want to stay here desperately, they're not able to stay here.	0
For that purpose, we absolutely have to be able to keep the brain power in this country.	0
[ applause ]	0
So you abandoning the position on your website...	0
...	0
I'm changing it, and I'm softening the position because we have to have talented people in this country.	0
And you're not releasing the discussion with the New York Times behind closed doors...	0
... That is correct.	0
Which will have some asking whether, on your immigration policies, you're really just playing to people's fantasies, which is a tactic...	0
... No, I'm not playing.	0
... you praised in your book, The Art of the Deal.	0
I'm not playing to anybody's fantasies, I'm playing to the fact that our country is in trouble, that we have a tremendous problem with crime.	0
The border is a disaster, it's like a piece of Swiss cheese.	0
We're going to stop it, we're going to stop people from coming into our country illegally.	0
We're going to stop it.	0
[	0
applause ]	0
[ cheering ]	0
Senator Cruz, not long ago you propose quintupling the number of these foreign worker visas.	0
After you announced for president, you reversed yourself, citing reports that the program was being abused.	0
But, that abuse had been around long before your 180.	0
In fact, it was so bad that just a few months earlier that a bipartisan group of senators called for an investigation and you declined to join them.	0
Isn't it a good thing that the American public didn't trust Ted on that one?	0
Well, the abuse of the H1-B program has been rampant.	0
On the face of that H1-B abuse, I have proposed, and promised as president that I will impose a 180 day moratorium on the H1B program to implement a comprehensive investigation and audit because you got U.S. companies that are firing American workers, bringing in foreign workers, and forcing them to train their replacements.	0
And, I would note that is not dissimilar to what we discovered at the last debate concerning the hotel that Donald owns down in Florida.	0
Down in Florida that hotel has brought in hundreds of foreign workers, and afterwards it was really striking.	0
I watched the CNN interview Donald did where he explained, he said, well the problem is you can't find Americans who are qualified, or who want to work as waiters and waitresses.	0
Now, let me ask the people here, how many people have worked as a waiter or waitress?	0
[ applause ]	0
Millions across this country.	0
That is an astonishing statement.	0
You know, Marco's Dad started as a bartender.	0
My Dad started washing dishes, and yet, you know how many Americans wanted those jobs?	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
Roughly 300 applied, Donald hired 17.	0
And, that's why this New York Times tape is so troubling because what's been reported is that Donald told the Editorial Board of the New York Times what I'm saying on immigration, I don't believe.	0
I'm not going to build a wall, I'm not going to deport people, this is all just rhetoric for the voters.	0
Now, if he didn't say that, he has an easy solution.	0
Simply release the tape.	0
But, for everyone at home who's mad at politicians that lied to us, Donald's record right now as he standing here...	0
... OK.	0
... His record right now is one of repeatedly hiring illegal aliens...	0
... Times up, sir...	0
... abusing American workers...	0
... Go ahead, Mr. Trump.	0
First of all I've had tens of thousands of people working for me, most of which are — 98, 97, 98 percent of the people in this country, from this country.	0
I'm very proud of it.	0
You have a club in Palm Beach, Florida called the Mar-a-Lago Club, it's a very, very successful club.	0
It has a very short season, it's called, the Season, and it goes from November until March.	0
It's a few months, five months at the most.	0
People don't want a short-term job.	0
They don't want — so, we will bring people in, and we will send the people out.	0
All done legally, all done with the process that's...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...approved by government in Palm Beach, or West Palm Beach.	0
We bring people in, we bring them out.	0
We want to hire as many Americans as we can, but they don't want part-time, very short part-time jobs.	0
Understood.	0
Thank you.	0
That's not accurate.	0
I'm sorry, Megyn, that's not accurate.	0
That's my — there were at least 300 Americans that applied last year, none of them were hired.	0
Some of them...	0
... Wrong...	0
... have been interviewed...	0
... That's wrong.	0
...	0
They were not hired...	0
... Wrong...	0
... And, here's why he does it this way, let me explain why he	0
[ inaudible ]	0
H2-B...	0
... Wrong...	0
... Because when you bring them in this way, when you bring someone in on one of these visas they can't go work for anybody else.	0
They either work for you or they have to go back home.	0
You basically have them captive, so you don't have to worry about competing for higher wages with another hotel down the street.	0
And, that's why you bring workers from abroad.	0
You argue that you're here to fight on behalf of the American worker, but when you have chances to help the American worker...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...but when you have chances to help the American workers, you're making your clothes overseas and you're hiring your workers from overseas.	0
[ applause ]	0
Go ahead, sir.	0
The — the — the other hotels during the season, they do the same thing.	0
They take in a lot of people, because you can't get them.	0
They take in a lot of people.	0
Long-term employees, we don't do that, but short-term employees, we have no choice but to do it, and other hotels in that very, very hot area.	0
It is a very hot area.	0
There were Americans in that hot area.	0
It's very, very hard to get people.	0
But other hotels do the exact same thing.	0
And just so you understand, just again, this is a legal process.	0
This is a procedure.	0
It's part of the law.	0
I take advantage of that.	0
There's nothing wrong with it.	0
We have no choice.	0
All right.	0
Donald, you could resolve this issue very quickly by simply...	0
[ audience booing ]	0
...releasing the New York Times tape.	0
Because, listen, maybe it's right.	0
This wasn't on the subject.	0
... that you didn't tell them you're misleading the American people.	0
If that's the case...	0
Tapes were not on the subject, but that's...	0
If you didn't tell them that, the tapes will prove you're innocent.	0
OK.	0
But if, in fact, you went to Manhattan and said I'm lying to the American people, then the voters have a right to know.	0
No, no.	0
You're the liar.	0
You're the lying guy up here.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Because we've been lied to too many times.	0
You're the — you're the one.	0
You're the one.	0
Why don't you release the tapes?	0
Release the tapes.	0
You're the one.	0
Now, let me just tell you.	0
Let me just tell you.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Excuse me.	0
Excuse me.	0
I've given my answer, Lyin' Ted.	0
I've given my answer.	0
All right.	0
Let's leave it at that.	0
[ audience booing ]	0
Let's leave it at that.	0
We have more to get to.	0
[ audience booing ]	0
Gentlemen, the next topic to discuss is terrorism.	0
Senator Rubio, ISIS is a big topic of conversation on Facebook.	0
We have a map that shows the conservation about ISIS around the country.	0
You proposed sending a larger number of American ground troops to help defeat ISIS in Syria and Iraq...	0
That's correct, and Libya.	0
... but military commanders say the biggest ISIS threat to Europe in particular now is coming from Libya, not Syria.	0
Correct.	0
So just to be clear, if you're for putting more U.S. ground troops in Iraq and Syria, are you also ready to send U.S. ground troops on the ground in Libya?	0
Well, Bret, what I've argued from the very beginning is ISIS — in order to defeat ISIS, you must deny them operating spaces.	0
This is how ISIS or any radical group, for that matter, can grow.	0
It's how Al Qaida was able to carry out 9/11, is that the Taliban gave them an operating space in Afghanistan.	0
Today that operating space has largely been based in Iraq and Syria, but I've been warning about the Libyan presence for the better part of two years.	0
So they need to be targeted wherever they have an operating space.	0
They do need to be defeated on the ground by a ground force made up primarily of Sunni Arabs themselves.	0
This is a radical Sunni movement.	0
They can only be defeated if they are driven out and the territory is held by Sunni Arabs.	0
But it will require a specific number of American special operators, in combination with an increase in air strikes.	0
And that will include, if necessary, operating spaces in Libya, which, in fact, they are using to project into the Sinai against Egypt and ultimately into Europe, as well.	0
Governor Kasich, would you put ground troops in Libya?	0
Well, first of all, just to be clear, not only did I serve for 18 years on the Defense Committee, more than anybody on this stage, but, secondly, I was called into the Pentagon after 9/11 to help Secretary Rumsfeld with some of his difficulties.	0
I will say, look, let me tell you what happened with Libya.	0
And I pointed out in the last debate — Hillary Clinton worked aggressively to depose Moammar Gadhafi.	0
We had no business doing it.	0
He was working with us.	0
He was cooperating with us.	0
He denuclearized.	0
And now they pushed him out, and now we have a fertile ground for ISIS.	0
Fortunately in Libya, there's only a few cities on the coast, because most of Libya is a desert.	0
The fact of the matter is, we absolutely have to be — and not just with special forces.	0
I mean, that's not going to work.	0
Come on.	0
You've got to go back to the invasion when we pushed Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait.	0
We have to be there on the ground in significant numbers.	0
We do have to include our Muslim Arab friends to work with us on that.	0
And we have to be in the air.	0
And we — it should be a broad coalition, made up of the kinds of people that were involved when we defeated Saddam.	0
Now, you've got to be on the ground and in the air both in Syria and Iraq.	0
And at some point, we will have to deal with Libya.	0
I am very concerned about ISIS getting their hands on the oilfields in Libya and being able to fund their operations.	0
The fact is cool, calm, deliberate, effective, take care of the job, and then come home.	0
That's what we need to do with our military foreign policy.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump, just yesterday, almost 100 foreign policy experts signed on to an open letter refusing to support you, saying your embracing expansive use of torture is inexcusable.	0
General Michael Hayden, former CIA director, NSA director, and other experts have said that when you asked the U.S. military to carry out some of your campaign promises, specifically targeting terrorists' families, and also the use of interrogation methods more extreme than waterboarding, the military will refuse because they've been trained to turn down and refuse illegal orders.	0
So what would you do, as commander-in-chief, if the U.S. military refused to carry out those orders?	0
They won't refuse.	0
They're not going to refuse me.	0
Believe me.	0
But they're illegal.	0
Let me just tell you, you look at the Middle East.	0
They're chopping off heads.	0
They're chopping off the heads of Christians and anybody else that happens to be in the way.	0
They're drowning people in steel cages.	0
And he — now we're talking about waterboarding.	0
This really started with Ted, a question was asked of Ted last — two debates ago about waterboarding.	0
And Ted was, you know, having a hard time with that question, to be totally honest with you.	0
They then came to me, what do you think of waterboarding?	0
I said it's fine.	0
And if we want to go stronger, I'd go stronger, too, because, frankly...	0
[ applause ]	0
...that's the way I feel.	0
Can you imagine — can you imagine these people, these animals over in the Middle East, that chop off heads, sitting around talking and seeing that we're having a hard problem with waterboarding?	0
We should go for waterboarding and we should go tougher than waterboarding.	0
That's my opinion.	0
But targeting terrorists' families?	0
[ applause ]	0
And — and — and — I'm a leader.	0
I'm a leader.	0
I've always been a leader.	0
I've never had any problem leading people.	0
If I say do it, they're going to do it.	0
That's what leadership is all about.	0
Even targeting terrorists' families?	0
Well, look, you know, when a family flies into the World Trade Center, a man flies into the World Trade Center, and his family gets sent back to where they were going — and I think most of you know where they went — and, by the way, it wasn't Iraq — but they went back to a certain territory, they knew what was happening.	1
The wife knew exactly what was happening.	0
They left two days early, with respect to the World Trade Center, and they went back to where they went, and they watched their husband on television flying into the World Trade Center, flying into the Pentagon, and probably trying to fly into the White House, except we had some very, very brave souls on that third plane.	0
All right?	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Cruz, you were mentioned.	0
I have no problem with it.	0
Senator Cruz?	0
Bret, you know, I think the American people understand that yelling and cursing at people doesn't make you a tough guy.	0
We need a commander-in-chief that, number one, will rebuild the military, just like Ronald Reagan did in 1981 coming out of the weak Jimmy Carter administration.	0
He passed tax reform and regulatory reform.	0
The economy took off.	0
It generated millions in high-paying jobs, trillions in new revenue.	0
He rebuilt the military, bankrupted the Soviet Union, and won the Cold War.	0
As president, I will do the exact same thing with radical Islamic terrorism.	0
We will rebuild this military so that it remains the mightiest fighting force on the face of the planet.	0
And then, when I am commander-in-chief, every militant on the face of the Earth will understand that if they go and join ISIS, if they wage jihad against the United States of America, they are signing their death warrant.	0
[ applause ]	0
But, Senator Cruz, in 2013, you said you were open — you were open to the possibility that Edward Snowden had performed a considerable public service, you said back then, in revealing certain aspects of the NSA procedures.	0
Many of your colleagues in the Senate, including Senator Rubio, called him a traitor.	0
It took you until January of this year to call him a traitor and say he should be tried for treason.	0
Why the change of heart?	0
And why did it take you so long?	0
Well, Bret, as someone who spent much of his life in law enforcement, I believe you should start with the facts and evidence first before ending up with the verdict.	0
When the news first broke of the United States government engaging in massive surveillance on American citizens, that was a very troubling development, and it's why the United States Congress acted to correct it.	0
Now, at the same time, I said in that initial statement that if the evidence indicated that Edward Snowden violated the law, he should be prosecuted for violating the law.	0
And, indeed, since then, the evidence is clear that not only does Snowden violate the law, but it appears he committed treason.	0
Treason is defined under the Constitution as giving aid and comfort to the enemies of America, and what Snowden did made it easier for terrorists to avoid detection.	0
And Snowden's comments afterwards, and his behavior afterwards, he fled to Russia, he fled to China.	0
His conducts afterwards indicates that he was not a whistleblower, but instead he was undermining the ability to defend this country.	0
But we need a president who isn't rash, who doesn't just pop off at the — at the hip, but waits to see what the facts are and then acts to defend this country.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump, you've repeatedly deflected calls for specific national security or defense policy plans with the claim that you'll ask the best people when you become president, and take their advice.	0
So who are the best people?	0
Can you reveal two or three names that you trust for national security?	0
I think Richard Haass is excellent.	0
I have a lot of respect for him.	0
I think General Keane is excellent.	0
I think that there are — I like Colonel Jacobs very much.	0
I see him.	0
I know him.	0
I have many people that I think are really excellent but in the end it's going to be my decision.	0
When you just asked the question about Snowden, I will tell you right from the beginning, I said he was a spy and we should get him back.	0
And if Russia respected our country, they would have sent him back immediately, but he was a spy.	0
It didn't take me a long time to figure that one out.	0
Believe me.	0
But I would get the best people, people that I'd be comfortable with.	0
And we will do the right thing.	0
Bret, it's very interesting to note, I think it's for the good of the record here that they took a survey of foreign policy magazines, 700 foreign policy experts, who would be the best person to conduct foreign policy of all the candidates in the race?	0
I received 55 percent of the vote.	0
Jeb Bush received 30 percent of the vote.	0
And everybody else, none of them made double digits.	0
And that's because you have to have the experience.	0
And you know, we hear about Ronald Reagan rebuilding the military.	0
I was there when Ronald Reagan rebuilt the military.	0
I worked with him.	0
I was there when Ronald Reagan rebuilt the economy.	0
I was there, and I worked with him.	0
I knew Ronald Reagan.	0
And I'll leave it right there with what comes after that.	0
You can figure that one out.	0
Governor Kasich, thank you.	0
We're going to have more questions for the candidates right after this break.	0
And during the commercial break, join us for a — Facebook live on the FOX News Facebook page and tell us what you think about tonight's debate in the comment section.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back to the historic Fox Theater in downtown Detroit and the Republican presidential debate.	0
Let's get right back to the questions.	0
Mr. Trump, one of the things people love about you is they believe you tell it like it is.	0
But time and time again in this campaign, you have actually told the voters one thing only to reverse yourself within weeks or even sometimes days.	0
We've teed up just three examples in a videotape, similar to those we used with Senator Rubio and Senator Cruz in the last debate.	0
The first is on whether the war in Afghanistan was a mistake.	0
Watch.	0
[ begin video clip ]	0
What about in Afghanistan?	0
Do you believe that American boots should stay on the ground in Afghanistan to stabilize the situation?	0
We've made a terrible mistake getting involved there in the first place.	0
That thing will collapse about two seconds after they leave.	0
Just as I said that Iraq was going to collapse after we leave.	0
About Afghanistan, you said we made a terrible mistake getting involved there in the first place.	0
We made a mistake going into Iraq.	0
I've never said we made a mistake...	0
Our question was about Afghanistan.	0
That day on October...	0
Well, OK, I never said that.	0
... was on Afghanistan.	0
OK. Wouldn't matter.	0
I never said it.	0
[ end video clip ]	0
Next, on whether we should accept...	0
Should I respond to that first?	0
Two more, and then you'll have the floor.	0
Next on whether we should accept the Syrian refugees...	0
You'll be here a long time.	0
On whether we should accept the Syrian refugees.	0
[ begin video clip ]	0
Do you object to migrants who are getting out of the Middle East and North Africa?	0
Do you object to them coming to the USA?	0
I hate the concept of it, but on a humanitarian basis, with what's happening, you have to.	0
It's living in Hell in Syria; there's no question about it.	0
They're living in Hell.	0
Are you saying absolutely people from Syria, the Middle East, should we allow any of them into this country?	0
Look, from a humanitarian standpoint, I'd love to help, but we have our own problems.	0
We have so many problems that we have to solve.	0
[ end video clip ]	0
Most recently, on whether President George W. Bush lied to get us into the Iraq war.	0
[ begin video clip ]	0
They lied.	0
They said there were weapons of mass destruction; there were none.	0
And they knew there were none.	0
I don't know if he lied or not.	0
He could have lied.	0
Maybe he did.	0
Maybe he didn't.	0
I guess you'd have to ask him.	0
[ end video clip ]	0
And there are many other examples.	0
"So how is any of this ""telling it like it is""?"	0
Well, on Afghanistan, I did mean Iraq.	0
I think you have to stay in Afghanistan for a while, because of the fact that you're right next to Pakistan, which has nuclear weapons, and we have to protect that.	0
Nuclear weapons change the game.	0
And I was always against going into Iraq.	0
In fact, I — believe me, I was always against it.	0
There was some cases where I sort of — in one interview with a great friend of mine, and yours, Howard Stern — said that — said that...	0
[ laughter ]	0
I said very meekly, long before we went in, I said very meekly, well, maybe, maybe, I don't know.	0
By the time it got to that point, I was always against Iraq.	0
But Afghanistan, I felt — and in that one, if you notice, I corrected it the second day.	0
OK?	0
Second question?	0
There are several examples, Mr. Trump.	0
No, no.	0
But...	0
We went through the Afghanistan being a mistake.	0
Within one day, you reversed yourself on Syrian refugees.	0
Now on — let me explain that.	0
You're right.	0
Let me explain.	0
First time the question had been put to me, it was very early on.	0
The migration had just started.	0
And I had heard that the number was a very, very small number.	0
By the second day, two or three days later, I heard the number was going to be thousands and thousands of people.	0
You know, when they originally heard about it, they were talking about bringing very, very small numbers in.	0
And I said, begrudgingly, well, I guess maybe that's OK.	0
"It was not like, ""Let's bring them in,"" because I think we should build a safe zone in — we should really — what we should be doing is building safe zones so they can stay in their own country and not go all over, and at least this way we're not going to have the problem."	0
That's what we have to do.	0
[ applause ]	0
But just — just to set — because I fully understand what you're asking.	0
When I first heard the question, first time the question was ever asked to me, first time I really had known about the question, the migration had just started.	0
I was very much like, OK, by the time I went back and studied it, and they were talking about bringing thousands and thousands, I changed my tune.	0
And I don't think there's anything wrong with that.	0
But the point I'm going for is you change your tune on so many things, and that has some people saying, what is his core?	0
Megyn, I have a very strong core.	0
[ applause ]	0
I have a very strong core.	0
But I've never seen a successful person who wasn't flexible, who didn't have a certain degree of flexibility.	0
You have to have a certain degree of flexibility.	0
[ applause ]	0
You can't — for instance, let's say, on — on the second question, you can't say it's OK, and then you find out it's not OK, and you don't want to do anything.	0
You have to be flexible, because you learn.	0
I mean, before I knew the question was asked by Bill, and the next day, or the couple of days later, the question was asked by, by — you know — I was asked by a number of people, actually.	0
I was asked by Sean, but I was asked by a number of people.	0
But by that time, the number had increased significantly.	0
Sean was the next day after Bill.	0
The next day.	0
But I had learned.	0
I mean, nobody had ever asked me the question.	0
This was brand new.	0
But — and I really mean it.	0
You have to show a degree of flexibility.	0
If you're going to be one way and you think it's wrong, does that mean the rest of your life you have to go in the wrong direction because you don't want to change?	0
[ applause ]	0
Megyn.	0
[ inaudible ]	0
Go ahead, Governor.	0
I did 200 meetings in New Hampshire, I don't know how many in Michigan now.	0
In these townhalls people come in and they're very emotional meetings.	0
And, you know what they really want to know?	0
If somebody tells them something, can they believe it?	0
And, the reason why people are so upset in this country is because politicians all the time tell them what they want to hear.	0
And, they go to Washington, or they go to the state capital, wherever, and they don't deliver on those promises.	0
You know, when I ran for Governor of Ohio, I said not only would we balance the budget, but we would cut taxes.	0
People said that can't be done.	0
I wouldn't have said it if I didn't believe it.	0
We cut taxes in Ohio more than any governor in the country, and $5 billion dollars worth of tax cuts — we're not running a surplus in Ohio.	0
But, you see, what's getting in the hearts and souls of the people is they want change, and they keep putting outsiders in to bring about the change, then the change doesn't come.	0
Then they put more outsiders in because we're putting people in that don't understand compromise.	0
They don't understand policy...[	0
bell ringing ]	0
[ applause ]	0
...They're getting more and more frustrated with the system which is why we must pick somebody that has a record of achievement, not just talk.	0
OK.	0
Not just talk, but a record of achievement.	0
That's how we'll restore credibility..	0
...	0
This isn't just about flexibility.	0
Go ahead, Senator.	0
There's a difference between flexibility and telling people whatever you think you need to say to get them to do what you want them to do.	0
[ cheering ]	0
And, that's what Donald has done throughout his career.	0
[ inaudible ]	0
Well, he did, and that's why Trump University...	0
... That's not right...	0
... Is so relevant here.	0
I saw this video last week where he's sitting in front of a camera saying we're going to hire the best people, and I'm going to hand pick them.	0
There are going to be hand picked and instructors, the best instructors in the world.	0
One of them, but the way, was the manager at a Buffalo Wild Wing.	0
And, that's who they hired to do this, and people borrowed money, and they signed up for this fake university.	0
And, these people owe all this money now, and they got nothing in return for it, but you are willing to say whatever you had to say...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...to get them to give you their money...	0
... Go ahead, Mr. Trump...	0
... We'll find out when we have the	0
[ inaudible ]	0
...	0
... And, we're not going to do that to our country...	0
... And, by the way, just so you understand...	0
[ applause ]	0
...this is a case I could have settled very easily, but I don't settle cases very easily when I'm right.	0
"Ninety-eight percent approval rating, we have an ""A"" from the Better Business Bureau..."	1
... That's false...	0
... We have a 98 percent approval rating from the people who took the course.	0
"We have an ""A"" from the Better Business Bureau."	0
And, people like it.	0
Now, he's saying they didn't learn.	0
We have many, many people that will be witnesses.	0
Again, I don't settle cases.	0
I don't do it because that's why I don't get sued very often, because I don't settle, unlike a lot of other people.	0
We have a situation where we will win in court...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...But, many of the people that are witnesses did tremendously well, and made a lot of money...	0
... That's false...	0
... By taking the course.	0
Go ahead, Senator.	0
You're going to see, you don't know...	0
...	0
"The Better Business Bureau gave it a ""D"" minus."	0
You're going to see, you're going to see.	0
...	0
It's Senator Rubio's turn...	0
... No, no.	0
Before they had the information...	0
... Go on my website, Marco Rubio.com...	0
... Before they had the information...	0
...	0
Senator Rubio, standby, let him finish his point, and then I'll give you the floor...	0
"... Before they had the information it got — it is right now an ""A"", once they had the information..."	0
...	0
[ inaudible ]	0
this anymore.	0
...	0
"The only reason that is was a ""D"" was because we didn't care — we didn't give them the information..."	0
... A third of the people	0
[ inaudible ]	0
...	0
...	0
"When they got the information it became an ""A""..."	0
... With respect — wait.	0
With respect...	0
... Marco you don't know	0
[ inaudible ]	0
...	0
... With respect, we went back and looked at this...	0
...	0
Yes.	0
"The rating from the Better Business Bureau was a ""D"" minus..."	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
...	0
[ inaudible ]	0
... that's the last publicly available rating in 2010, and it was the result of a number of complaints they had...	0
...	0
"But it was elevated to an ""A""..."	0
[ inaudible ]	0
... That's never been publicly available.	0
...	0
I can give it to you.	0
I can give it to you tomorrow..	0
... Let's just bring the viewers up to speed, let's just bring the viewers up to speed.	0
...	0
"It was elevated to an ""A""."	0
Let me just set the record, and then you guys can have at it.	0
There was Trump University, which was a business that you started, and it was marketed...	0
... Small business...	0
... to many people, and now there is a class-action of over 5,000 plaintiffs against you, Mr. Trump...	0
...	0
Right...	0
... And, it involves veterans, and it involves teachers, and it involves so-called little guys, working class, and lower- working class and middle class who say that they were fleeced, who say that it was as scam.	0
The class has been certified, and in that case you counter-sued the lead plaintiff alleging that you were being defamed.	0
That case was thrown out against her...	0
...	0
The lead plaintiff is now getting out of the case because it's so bad for her...	0
...	0
But, what happened was...	0
...	0
Excuse me, the lead plaintiff signed a letter saying how great it was, and it on tape saying how great it was.	0
OK, no, but — standby.	0
But, what happened in that case was you counter-sued her.	0
The court threw out your counter-suit, and made you pay almost $800,000 dollars in legal fees of hers, and you made the same argument about 98 percent of the people being happy with Trump University.	0
And, that woman in particular signing a survey saying she liked it while someone was standing over her shoulder...	0
... She's trying to get out of the case.	0
She's trying to get out of the case...	0
... And this is what — standby, this is what the Court of Appeals found.	0
They said that the plaintiffs against you are like the Madoff victims...	0
Oh, give me a break...	0
...This is what the Court of Appeals said.	0
Give me a break.	0
This is what the court of appeals said.	0
Give me a break.	0
They found that victims of con artists often sing the praises of their victimizers until they realize they have been fleeced.	0
You know what, let's see what happens in court.	0
This is a civil case.	0
Very easy to have settled.	0
Could settle it now.	0
Very easy to have settled.	0
Let's see what happens at the end of a couple years when this case is over, OK?	0
It has been going for five years.	0
Yes, it has been going for a long time.	0
Go ahead, Senator.	0
I spoke to one of the victims yesterday.	0
We'll win the case.	0
I spoke to one of the victims yesterday.	0
One, one of the victims.	0
No, there are several.	0
Obviously there are so many, I can't talk to them every day.	0
I spoke to one of them, he told me exactly what happened.	0
They signed up for this course because they believed Mr. Trump was this fantastic businessman, that Donald is going to teach them the tricks of the trade.	0
They signed up.	0
They paid $15,000 for this course.	0
They were asked for additional money for this course.	0
If they really wanted the real secrets of success, they had to pay even more money, and so they did.	0
And you know what they got in these courses?	0
Stuff you can pull off of Zillow.	0
When they finally realized what a scam it was, they asked for their money back.	0
And you refused to give them their money back.	0
Why don't you tonight...	0
I gave many people their money back.	0
Then why don't you tonight say you're going to give the money back to everybody who wants...	0
Let me just...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
OK.	0
Senator Rubio, let him answer.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Let him answer.	0
Go ahead, Mr. Trump.	0
We will see who's right at the end of a few years.	0
But all of the — almost all of the people, many, many people signed what's called the report card at the end, did you like the course, how did you like it.	0
Almost all of them said it was terrific, OK?	0
With letters, with this.	0
Some of them are on tape saying it was terrific.	0
Let's see what happens at the end of three years.	0
With respect, Mr. Trump, one-third of the plaintiffs in that case demanded refunds.	0
So it's not the case that 98 percent were...	0
I gave some refunds to people because if they asked for the refunds in a certain period of time, and we gave refunds to people.	0
OK.	0
But let's see what happens at the end of three years.	0
Let's see who's right.	0
Still a pending litigation.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
It's called pending litigation.	0
Megyn, this is why this is relevant to this election.	0
All right.	0
Senator Rubio then Senator Cruz.	0
Go ahead.	0
This is why, because he's trying to do to the American voter what he did to the people that signed up for this course.	0
He's making promises he has no intention of keeping.	0
And it won't just be $36,000 that they lose, it's our country that's at stake here.	0
The future of the United States and the most important election in a generation, and he's trying to con people into giving them their vote just like he conned these people into giving him their money.	0
Let me tell you the real con artist.	0
Excuse me.	0
Excuse me.	0
The real con artist is Senator Marco Rubio who was elected in Florida and who has the worst voting record in the United States Senate.	0
He doesn't go to vote.	0
He's absent.	0
He doesn't go.	0
Now, the people of Florida can't stand him.	0
He couldn't get elected dogcatcher.	0
The people of Florida — the people of Florida — and by the way, I know he's going to spend $25 million on ads.	0
Without that he wouldn't have a chance.	0
He's 20 points south.	0
The people in Florida wouldn't elect him dogcatcher.	0
He couldn't get any — he's right now 21 points down to me.	0
And, you know...	0
OK.	0
... again, there will be a lot of advertising.	0
It's the only thing that might save him.	0
But I doubt it.	0
Notice that's not an answer.	0
I'm coming to you next.	0
But go ahead.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
He scammed the people of Florida.	0
He scammed people.	0
He doesn't vote.	0
He doesn't show up for the U.S. Senate.	0
He doesn't vote.	0
He scammed the people.	0
He defrauded the people of Florida.	0
With respect, you've made that point.	0
Go ahead.	0
There's no — as you can see in his answer, it's always the same thing.	0
You defrauded the people of Florida, little Marco.	0
He has defrauding people out of things, and not just — and not just, by the way, on the issue of Trump University.	0
He had another development in Mexico that he had nothing to do with except his name on the building.	0
People put money into that building.	0
That was licensing.	0
They lost their money.	0
Yes, licensing, but you told them you owned the building.	0
So they gave him his money.	0
They lost their money.	0
Time and again...	0
All right.	0
Stand by.	0
I will come back to you.	0
Senator Cruz wants to weigh in.	0
You're coming back.	0
Go ahead.	0
Megyn, let me ask the voters at home, is this the debate you want playing out in the general election?	0
The stakes in this election are too high.	0
For seven years, millions of Americans, we've been struggling, wages have been stagnating, people are hurting, our constitutional rights are under assault.	0
And if we nominate Donald, we're going to spend the spring, the fall, and the summer with the Republican nominee facing a fraud trial...	0
Oh, stop it.	0
... with Hillary Clinton saying...	0
It's just a minor case.	0
It's a minor case.	0
... why did you give my campaign and my foundation $100,000?	0
It's a minor civil case.	0
And with Hillary Clinton...	0
Give me a break.	0
... pointing out that he supported her four times in her presidential race.	0
It's a minor civil case.	0
Donald, learn not to interrupt.	0
It's not complicated.	0
There are many, many civil cases.	0
Count to 10, Donald.	0
Count to 10.	0
Give me a break.	0
Count to 10.	0
The stakes are too high and if you are one of the 65 to 70 percent of Republicans who recognize that nominating Donald would be a disaster, then I ask you to come join us.	0
If you're supporting other candidates, come join us.	0
We welcome you to our team because we've demonstrated not once, not twice, not three times, but five separate times we have beat Donald.	0
And if you don't want him to be the nominee, then I ask you to stand with us as a broad coalition of people who believe in the Constitution, believe in freedom, and want to turn this country around.	0
Go ahead, Mr. Trump.	0
I don't believe these politicians.	0
All talk, no action.	0
I'm standing here listening to — I'm hearing him say about a percentage.	0
CNN, he gets 15.	0
That means 85 percent, based on what you're saying, of the people don't dig you, number one, number one.	0
Is that a correct statement?	0
How do you get — are you at 15 in the new CNN poll?	0
Do you believe in CNN?	0
I mean, I know we're with FOX.	0
But CNN spent — CNN...	0
All right, I'll respond...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
CNN spent a lot of money on a poll, just came out.	0
I'm at 49.	0
He's at 15.	0
He tells me about 65 percent of the people.	0
It's not 65 percent of the people.	0
If you go by that, 85 percent of the people.	0
Then he goes, we have five.	0
And — well, excuse me, I won 10.	0
I won 10 states.	0
If you listen to him, it's like — I won 10 states.	0
Everybody knows that on Super Tuesday Trump was the winner.	0
There wasn't one person that didn't say that.	0
Even the two people on your left and right said we did a great job.	0
So how does he take — how does he take five and say it's better than 10?	0
Go ahead, Senator.	0
I am by far the leader.	0
But if you listen to a politician, he'll try and convince you otherwise.	0
Senator Cruz, go.	0
All right, well, Donald lives by the polls every day.	0
He tweets about the polls.	0
No, I don't.	0
No, I don't.	0
He's told us to look to the CNN poll.	0
Well, that's a very good poll to look to, because that CNN poll showed that head to head Donald Trump loses to Hillary Clinton by 8 points.	0
He doesn't just lose close; he loses by 8 points.	0
That same poll he told you to look at shows me beating Hillary Clinton.	0
[ applause ]	0
We cannot mess this up.	0
And, by the way, the last four polls in a row, when you nominate a candidate who literally has been on every side of every issue, and in the course of this debate may be on two other sides before we're done, that's not how you win.	0
And the stakes are too high.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
All right.	0
I'm going to let Mr. Trump — I'm going to let — let me just...	0
According to your poll...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
I'm going to let you respond to that, Mr. Trump.	0
I'm going to then go to you, Governor.	0
You're up next.	0
...	0
I know, but your recent polls have me beating Hillary Clinton, and very, very easily.	0
OK. Do you want to weigh in?	0
All right, look, honestly, when I see people at these meetings, these town halls, where we take massive questions, and I get to spend time with them.	0
Last night, there was a woman that came to tell me about the loss of her 15-year-old son, who took his own life.	0
See, there's people in this country — and Ted's right — their wages haven't gone up for so long, they see the rich get richer, they believe, and they're not moving.	0
And they put their money in the bank, and they got no interest on their money.	0
They receive none.	0
And their sons or daughters are living in the basement because they can't get a good job after they rang up so much college debt.	0
What people are hungry for is, who can fix this?	0
People want to know who — what can you do to solve the problems in Washington, to make sure that we have stronger job growth and better wages?	0
But you know what else they're yearning for?	0
They want to believe that they have the power to fix things where they live, and they want the power back, so they can begin to do things in their community.	0
Now, listen, this has been going on for a long time here.	0
And I appreciate the discussion back and forth.	0
But there are a lot of people out there yearning for somebody who's going to bring America back, both at the leadership level and in the neighborhood, where we can begin to reignite the spirit of the United States of America.	0
And let's stop fighting.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor, thank you.	0
Gentlemen, thank you.	0
Much more to come live from the Fox Theater, including where the candidates stand on the social issues facing the country.	0
The Republican presidential debate continues in a moment.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back, everybody, to the Fox News Republican presidential debate.	0
We want to get right back to the questions.	0
[ applause ]	0
We are here in Detroit.	0
The top issues in Michigan, according to Facebook, are displayed in a word cloud you're taking a look at.	0
The second biggest issue is clean water.	0
That, of course, is directly tied with the situation in Flint.	0
Senator Rubio, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have both been to Flint.	0
They are both running ads in this state focusing on that, focusing on supporting Flint and fixing the problems, showing images of people in Flint thankful that they're there.	0
Without getting into the political blame game here, where are the national Republicans' plans on infrastructure and solving problems like this?	0
If you talk to people in this state, they are really concerned about Flint on both sides of the aisle.	0
So why haven't GOP candidates done more or talked more about this?	0
Well, I know I've talked about it, and others in our campaign have talked about it, and other candidates have talked about it, as well.	0
What happened in Flint was a terrible thing.	0
It was systemic breakdown at every level of government, at both the federal and partially the — both the state and partially at the federal level, as well.	0
"And by the way, the politicizing of it I think is unfair, because I don't think that someone woke up one morning and said, ""Let's figure out how to poison the water system to hurt someone."""	0
[ applause ]	0
But accountability is important.	0
I will say, I give the governor credit.	0
He took responsibility for what happened.	0
And he's talked about people being held accountable...	0
[ applause ]	0
...and the need for change, with Governor Snyder.	0
But here's the point.	0
This should not be a partisan issue.	0
"The way the Democrats have tried to turn this into a partisan issue, that somehow Republicans woke up in the morning and decided, ""Oh, it's a good idea to poison some kids with lead."""	0
It's absurd.	0
It's outrageous.	0
It isn't true.	0
[ applause ]	0
All of us are outraged by what happened.	0
And we should work together to solve it.	0
And there is a proper role for the government to play at the federal level, in helping local communities to respond to a catastrophe of this kind, not just to deal with the people that have been impacted by it, but to ensure that something like this never happens again.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0

Governor Kasich, the city of Detroit has long suffered with urban blight, broken street lights, dilapidated and vacant houses, and so on.	0
In 2013, Detroit actually declared bankruptcy, which helped, but the schools here remain a big problem.	0
They're $3.5 billion in debt and are some of the most troubled and poorly testing in the country.	0
The kids too often go to classrooms that are unsafe, falling apart, infested with rodents and insects.	0
Experts say the schools could go bankrupt by next month.	0
Question to you.	0
If the federal government bailed out the auto industry here in Detroit, should it also bail out the Detroit schools?	0
Well, look, first of all, I think the mayor now is controlling the schools.	0
"This is not much different than what happened in Cleveland, Ohio, where the African-American Democrat mayor, the union, and business leaders came to see me and said, ""Would you help us to pass legislation to really create a CEO environment so that we can take control of the schools?"""	0
We even invested in a buyout plan, where we bought out the teachers who had been there a long time, because there were so many young teachers who had been laid off who were so enthusiastic to get back in the schools.	0
It worked beautifully.	0
Cleveland's coming back.	0
The Cleveland schools are coming back because of a major overhaul.	0
It's the same thing that has to happen in all of our urban schools.	0
And, frankly, look, if I were president, I'd take 104 federal programs, bundle them into four buckets, and send it to the states, because fixing schools rests at the state and the local level, and particularly at the school board level.	0
[ applause ]	0
Now, I also believe — I also believe that you need to introduce vocational education in those schools.	0
You need mentoring in those schools.	0
And you need to have a situation where people can have an alternative forum to get a degree.	0
And you need school choice, both vouchers and charter schools.	0
All of those things can come together to help, Megyn.	0
But here's the bottom line.	0
And I'll go quickly.	0
We as adults have to fight in our neighborhoods, in our communities, for our children's education.	0
Put the politics aside, and everyone in this room can play a role in lifting their schools and lifting the students who are in those schools, because too much politics gets in the middle of it, and where we focus as adults, and put children first, we see tremendous results.	0
And the people of this town are going to rise.	0
And they need to be involved.	0
Thank you.	0
[ applause ]	0
For — for half a century, as you all know, Detroit was the symbol of America's industrial might: 300,000 manufacturing jobs in this city.	0
At last count, there are now fewer than 30,000 manufacturing jobs here, and the unemployment rate in this city is 11 percent, twice the national average.	0
Senator Cruz, I know that you have general plans for tax reform, but what specifically would you do to bring manufacturing jobs back to America and train residents of cities like Detroit to do those jobs?	0
Well, Chris, thank you for that question.	0
Let me start by observing that Detroit is a great city with a magnificent legacy that has been utterly decimated by 60 years of failed left-wing policy.	0
[ applause ]	0
You know, Henry Ford revolutionized automobile manufacturing and brought automobiles to the middle class.	0
During World War II, Detroit provided — funded the arsenals of democracy to help us win World War II.	0
In — in the 1960s, Detroit was the Silicon Valley of America.	0
It had a population of 2 million people, had the highest per capita income in the country.	0
And then, for 50 years, left-wing Democrats have pursued destructive tax policies, weak crime policies, and have driven the citizens out.	0
[ applause ]	0
This city now has just 700,000 citizens.	0
There are vacant homes, one after the other after the other.	0
Crime has been rampant, and it is an outrage.	0
And let me say to folks in the media: That is a story that the media ought to be telling over and over again, the destruction of left-wing policies and the millions who have hurt because of it.	0
[ applause ]	0
Well, I was going to say, I'll give you 30 seconds to try to answer my question.	0
What specifically would you do to bring manufacturing jobs back to Detroit and to train the residents here to do those jobs?	0
The way you bring manufacturing back to America is, number one, you lift the regulations.	0
As president, I will repeal Obamacare, the biggest job-killer in America.	0
I will pull back the federal regulators, the EPA and all the regulators that are killing small businesses and manufacturing.	0
And my tax plan, which is a very, very detailed plan on the website, tedcruz.org, is what's called border adjustable.	0
We get rid of all the taxes.	0
We get rid of the corporate income tax and the death tax and the Obamacare taxes and the payroll tax.	0
And we replace it with a 16 percent business flat tax that is border adjustable, which means all exports are entirely tax-free and all imports pay the 16 percent business flat tax.	0
That's a 32 percent differential.	0
What that will do, Chris, is bring millions of manufacturing jobs back to this country, bring the steel industry back to this country, create an environment where when we compete on a fair and level playing field, American ingenuity can beat anyone.	0
But right now, the federal government isn't giving us a level playing field.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
[ applause ]	0
Gentlemen, the next series of questions will be on social issues.	0
Governor Kasich, the last debate, you were asked a question about religious liberty, in a hypothetical situation where a same-sex couple approaches a cupcake maker to do their wedding.	0
Here's what you said.	0
[ begin video clip ]	0
If you're in the business of selling things, if you're not going to sell to somebody you don't agree with, today I'm not going to sell to somebody who's gay, then tomorrow maybe I won't sell to somebody who's divorced.	0
[ end video clip ]	0
Governor, some faith leaders got nervous about that answer.	0
Do gay marriage dissenters have rights?	0
Well, look, first of all, I try to be a man of faith every day as best as I can, and I try to focus in my faith on the dos and I think the don'ts will take care of themselves once I get the dos right, which is humility, and loving my enemy, and caring for my neighbor.	0
But secondly, look, you're in the commerce business, you want to sell somebody a cupcake, great.	0
OK?	0
But now if they ask you to participate in something you really don't like, that's a whole 'nother issue, OK?	0
Another issue.	0
Here's what I'd like to see happen.	0
The Supreme Court ruled, I don't agree with the ruling.	0
I'm of favor of marriage between — you know, traditional marriage, a man and a woman.	0
What I hope was going to happen after the Supreme Court ruling is things would settle down.	0
If you go to a photographer to take pictures at your wedding, and he says, I'd rather not do it, find another photographer, don't sue them in court.	0
You know what, the problem is in our country — in our country, we need to learn to respect each other and be a little bit more tolerant for one another.	0
And at the end of the day, don't go to court.	0
Can't we have common sense in America?	0
That's the way it used to be.	0
"And there was a book written called ""The Death of Common Sense."""	0
We need to bring it back.	0
But at the end of the day, if somebody is being pressured to participate in something that is against their deeply-held religious beliefs, then we're going to have to think about dealing with the law.	0
But you know what, I'd rather people figure this out without having to put another law on the books and have more arguments in this country.	0
Why don't we come together as a country, respect one another, love one another and lift this country?	0
I think that's what people want.	0
So thanks for asking.	0
Senator Cruz, the U.S. Supreme Court obviously declared same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states, a decision you have criticized.	0
Given the current status of the law, do you believe a gay couple should be able to adopt?	0
Well, listen, adoption is decided at the state level and I am a believer in the 10th Amendment in the Constitution, I would leave the question of marriage to the states, I would leave the question of adoption to the states.	0
That's the way it has been for two centuries of our nation's history until five unelected judges in an illegitimate and wrong decision decided to seize the authority over marriage and wrongfully tear down the marriage laws of all 50 states.	0
Now, interconnected to this is the question of religious liberty.	0
And at the last debate, one of my colleagues on this stage said on the question of religious liberty and Supreme Court nominees that he'd be willing to compromise and negotiate.	0
I can tell you, for me, there are areas that we should compromise on.	0
Marginal tax rates, we can reach a middle ground on.	0
But when it comes to core principles and convictions, when it comes to the Constitution and Bill of Rights, I can tell the men and women at home I will never compromise away your religious liberty.	0
And for me, Bret, religious liberty has been a lifelong passion.	0
I've spent two decades defending religious liberty, including defending the Ten Commandments before the U.S. Supreme Court and winning.	0
Defending the Pledge of Allegiance before the Supreme Court and winning.	0
And defending the Mojave Desert Veterans Memorial, a lone white Latin cross that was erected to honor the men and women who gave their lives in World War I. I represented 3 million veterans for free defending that memorial and we won 5-4 before the Supreme Court.	0
Senator, thank you.	0
Senator Cruz definitely avoided saying your name, Mr. Trump, but I think he was referring to you and your religious liberty answer.	0
Would you like to respond?	0
I have nothing to say.	0
I mean, generally speaking, agree with what he said.	0
I would have certainly have rather left it to the states.	0
I was always in favor — I was very surprised when they came up with that decision.	0
I would have certainly — I would have preferred had it been left to the states and I think most people would have preferred that.	0
Senator Rubio, the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative icon, obviously, pointed out, in the United States versus Heller, that like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited.	0
Just like the First Amendment doesn't allow you to go into a theater and yell fire, he said the Second Amendment leaves room to regulate guns.	0
So do you agree with Justice Scalia?	0
And if so, what limits would you draw around the Second Amendment?	0
As few as possible.	0
The Second Amendment, as I've said before, is not a suggestion.	0
It is the constitutional right of every American to protect themselves and their families.	0
It is a right that — it is the Second Amendment for a reason.	0
It is right after the defense of the freedom of speech for a reason, for clearly the founders of our nation understood and the framers of the Constitution understood that you cannot have life and you cannot have liberty and cannot pursue happiness if you are not safe.	0
And the Second Amendment — when people talk about gun laws, what they need to realize is, criminals don't follow gun laws.	0
They're criminals.	0
By definition, they ignore the law.	0
[ applause ]	0
But the gun rights of Americans, if you are talking to a law- abiding citizen and a gun-owner like myself, if you pass a law, I will follow whatever the law is.	0
A criminal will not do it.	0
They will continue to pursue these guns on the black market, where they then go out and commit crimes and they steal guns from each other.	0
Gun laws are not effective.	0
They simply do not provide for safety.	0
But they do, however, ensure that law-abiding people don't have access to weapons to protect themselves and guns to protect themselves, but criminals always will be well armed.	0
They don't care about the law; they don't follow the law.	0
We will protect the Second Amendment when I'm president of the United States.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump, you were once a supporter of an assault weapons ban.	0
So do you think there should be any restrictions on the Second Amendment?	0
No, I'm a big defender of the Second Amendment.	0
And if you look at what's happened, whether it's in California, where you had the 14 people killed, whether it's in Paris — which, by the way, has the toughest gun laws in the world and 130 people killed.	0
Many, many people in the hospital gravely injured.	0
They will be dying.	0
Many people will be dying in addition.	0
If we had guns, or if they had guns on the other side of the room, with the bullets going in the opposite direction, you would not have had 130 people killed.	0
That I can tell you right now.	0
[ applause ]	0
So I'm a very, very big supporter of the Second Amendment.	0
"But in 2000, you wrote in your book, ""I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons."""	0
I don't support it anymore.	0
I do not support the ban on assault.	0
[ audience booing ]	0
Senator Cruz?	0
Any limits to the Second Amendment?	0
Well, listen, unlike Donald, I would not support banning firearms.	0
In that instance, Bill Clinton banned many of the most popular firearms in America.	0
And by the way, the study showed that ban did nothing to reduce violent crime.	0
It just took away the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.	0
[ applause ]	0
"And let me point out, you know, it is easy for political candidates to have rhetoric and say, ""I support the Second Amendment."""	0
But you cannot say that and at the same time say what Donald just said, which is that on the question of Supreme Court nominees he wants to compromise and reach a middle ground with Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer.	0
That's what he said in the last debate.	0
I — I did not say that.	0
I did not say that.	0
And any justice that Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer sign off on...	0
I did not say that.	0
And I would point out, Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer are both Democrats that Mr. Trump has written checks to repeatedly.	0
Any justice that those two sign off on is going to be a left-wing judicial activist who will undermine religious liberty, and we are one vote away from the Heller decision being overturned, which would effectively erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights.	0
If you care about the Second Amendment, then you need to ask who on this stage do you know will appoint principled constitutionalists to the court and not cut a deal with your Second Amendment rights?	0
Mr. Trump...	0
So we're listening to the all-talk, no-action politician, and he was the primary supporter of John Roberts, who gave us Obamacare.	0
That's flat-out wrong.	0
No, it's not.	0
You take a look.	0
He was the primary supporter.	0
He pushed John Roberts, and pushed him, and pushed him, and Bush ultimately appointed him.	0
He got appointed.	0
And when it came his time to raise his hand and kill Obamacare, not once, but twice, he let us down, and he did the wrong thing.	0
This is the man that was the primary supporter.	0
And you can read law journal, you can read whatever you want to read — I've read plenty of it.	0
There was no stronger supporter of John Roberts than him.	0
And it was a very, very big mistake.	0
Quickly, Senator Cruz.	0
You know, Donald has a tenuous relationship with the truth.	0
[ laughter ]	0
I wrote one op-ed supporting President Bush's nomination after he made it.	0
I would not have made that nomination.	0
But let me point out...	0
Not what you say in the op-ed.	0
... if Donald actually cared about...	0
That is not what you said in the op-ed.	0
But, Donald, please, I know it's hard not to interrupt.	0
But try.	0
Yeah, I know it is.	0
But it's not what you said in the op-ed.	0
Breathe, breathe, breathe.	0
Lyin' Ted.	0
You can do it.	0
You can breathe.	0
I know it's hard.	0
I know it's hard.	0
But just...	0
When they're done with the yoga, can I answer a question?	0
You cannot.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Unbelievable.	0
I really hope that we don't — we don't see yoga on this stage.	0
Well, he's very flexible, so you never know.	0
[ applause ]	0
But you cannot, in fact, care about conservative Supreme Court justices and support Jimmy Carter for president.	0
You cannot care about conservative Supreme Court justices and support John Kerry for president, as Donald did.	0
You cannot care about conservative Supreme Court justices and support Harry Reid for Senate majority leader.	0
And you cannot care about conservative Supreme Court justices and write four checks to Hillary Clinton for her to be president if you care at all about the Second Amendment or religious liberty or anything else.	0
Gentlemen, gentlemen, we're going to move on.	0
Thank you very much.	0
We want to talk about some more policy questions coming up.	0
And coming up, the candidates tackle foreign policy.	0
But first, during the commercial break, join us for a Facebook live on the Fox News Facebook page and tell us what you think about tonight's debate in the comments section.	0
Stay with us.	0
More to come.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back, everybody.	0
We're going it get right back to the questions.	0
And gentlemen, we're going to focus for a bit now on foreign policy.	0
Senator Rubio, you like to take a shot at Mr. Trump on the campaign trail saying that negotiating a hotel deal in a foreign country is not foreign policy.	0
The other day you even compared him to Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, as lunatics trying to get a hold of nuclear weapons.	0
Please tell Mr. Trump why he's unprepared to be commander-in- chief.	0
Well, first of all, I think, as we've seen throughout this campaign, Donald has not shown a seriousness about the issues of foreign policy.	0
He just simply hasn't.	0
Whether it was the structure of our military, even today he was asked a question about the issue of commanders not following his lead on killing the family of terrorists.	0
And his answer basically was, if I tell them to do it, they're going to do it.	0
Now that's just not true.	0
Foreign policy is not only consequential, I think much of our future now depends on it.	0
You know, I see a lot of young people at my events around the country.	0
I feel great when they come.	0
And I always them that despite the hardships of the moment, I honestly believe that today's Millennials have a chance to be the greatest generation we've had in 100 years.	0
I really do.	0
Because the world today has hundreds of millions of people that can afford to be their clients, their customers, their partners, people they collaborate with.	0
But that won't happen if the world is dangerous and it's unstable.	0
And that will require strong American leadership.	0
The next president of the United States is going to have eight years of a mess of a foreign policy to clean up.	0
That's why it can't be Hillary Clinton.	0
And quite frankly, that's why it can't be someone who simply has not shown the intellectual curiosity or the interest in learning about these very complicated issues.	0
And Donald simply hasn't.	0
Mr. Trump, your response.	0
Well, let me just say this.	0
I've gotten to know Marco over a period of time, believe me, he is not a leader.	0
Believe me.	0
But that doesn't answer the question.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
He didn't interrupt you.	0
Let him talk.	0
He didn't answer — he's not a leader.	0
And, frankly, when I say they'll do as I tell them, they'll do as I tell them.	0
And that's very — it's very simple.	0
It's very simple.	0
We are in a very dangerous place.	0
We have a depleted military.	0
Totally depleted.	0
We have — by the way, our vets are treated horribly.	0
We're going to take care of our vets.	0
We're going to start taking care of our vets, properly, like we should.	0
[ applause ]	0
But we're going to build up our military, and we're going to get the equipment we want, not the equipment that's sold to us by somebody that gave him and him and not the governor campaign contributions.	0
OK?	0
We're going to get the equipment that the generals and the soldiers want.	0
I will prove to be a great leader.	0
And, you know, it's very interesting, we talk about the polls.	0
Every single poll when it comes to ISIS and the military and the border say, by far, Trump is the best.	0
Mr. Trump, your time is up.	0
Yeah, I just want to — a couple points.	0
Once again, he was pressed on a policy issue to show his understanding of the foreign policy, and his reaction was just to attack somebody else with a name.	0
Here's the bottom line.	0
And I'm going to repeat it again.	0
The world today is as complicated and as complex as it has been certainly in a very — certainly in the lifetime of anybody here today.	0
You indeed do have a lunatic in North Korea with nuclear weapons.	0
You indeed do have the Chinese government taking over the most important shipping lane in the world.	0
And Vladimir Putin, who you've expressed admiration for, Donald...	0
Wrong.	0
Wrong.	0
You've expressed admiration for him.	0
Wrong.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Donald, you said he's a strong leader.	0
Wrong.	0
He is now dividing Europe up...	0
He said very good things about me, and I said...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
All right, I'm going to finish my statement here.	0
Yeah, finish.	0
And he's also sowing instability in the Middle East.	0
You have Iran who's going to get $100 billion of sanctions relief.	0
You have radical jihadists spreading all over the world.	0
This is a time for seriousness on these issues.	0
You have yet to answer a single serious question about any of this.	0
Will you give us a detailed answer about foreign policy any time you're asked on it?	0
Let me just tell you, first of all, I've been hearing this man so long talking about Putin.	0
Putin said about me — I didn't say about Putin — Putin said very nice things about me.	0
And I say very nicely, wouldn't it be nice if actually we could get along with Russia, we could get along with foreign countries, instead of spending trillions and trillions of dollars?	0
You're talking about Flint, Michigan.	0
You're talking about places — we need to rebuild the infrastructure of our country.	0
Wouldn't it be nice if we got along with the world, and maybe Russia could help us in our quest to get rid of ISIS, et cetera, et cetera?	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Gentlemen, you both have had a chance to talk.	0
You both have had a chance to talk a couple of times.	0
I'd like to move on to Senator Cruz.	0
Senator, we have some breaking news tonight.	0
North Korea's dictator, Kim Jong-un, has ordered that country's nuclear weapons to be made ready at a moment's notice.	0
Yes.	0
Yes.	0
And this comes just hours after the U.N. Security Council announced that — approved the toughest sanctions in two decades against that country.	0
Assume you're President Cruz tonight.	0
What do you do?	0
Well, you're right, the news is very disturbing that Kim Jong-un has put their nuclear weapons on ready state.	0
I'm glad that we're sending another carrier group to the South China Sea.	0
I'm glad that Congress passed sanctions on North Korea.	0
But this is all the result of the failures of the Clinton administration two decades ago that negotiated a deal with North Korea lifting the sanctions, allowing billions of dollars to flow in, and they used that money to develop nuclear weapons in the first place.	0
What we — now we're in a much harder position.	0
When you have a lunatic with nuclear weapons, to some extent, it constrains your options.	0
We need to be moving the carrier — carrier group to the South China Seas.	0
We — we need to be putting in place missile defense, such as the THAAD missile defense system in South Korea.	0
We need to be pursuing space-based missile defense.	0
One of the advantages of space-based missile defense is that if you have a missile launch in North Korea or you have a missile launch in Iran, a space-based missile defense can take out one or two or three missiles before it can cross over and do damage.	0
And we also need to be putting pressure on China, because North Korea is effectively a — a client state of China.	0
All of that will happen with a strong commander-in-chief that is devoted to keeping this country safe.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Governor Kasich, I want to move back to the debate that we heard earlier about Vladimir Putin.	0
In December, after Vladimir Putin had some nice thing to say about Donald Trump, calling him bright and talented, your campaign ran a video suggesting that Trump might name the Russian president as his running mate.	0
Here's a clip.	0
I'll have to see this.	0
[ begin video clip ]	0
"If elected, Trump promised that the dictatorial duo would, quote, ""make tyranny great again."""	0
I think I'd get along very well with Vladimir Putin.	0
I just think so.	0
[	0
end video clip ]	0
[ laughter ]	0
That was your campaign video, sir.	0
That was a pretty good one.	0
Well, OK.	0
No, I...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
If I may — sir, if I may ask my question...	0
Of course.	0
I think you were kidding.	0
But it was your video and the serious question is, because the suggestion is, do you think that Donald Trump is naive about the threat that Vladimir Putin represents?	0
I'm not biting.	0
Let me take you around the world, OK?	0
Let me — look, I'm going to take you very quickly.	0
In Russia, we need to tell them we're going to arm the Ukrainians with defensive lethal weapons.	0
And we're going to tell Putin if you attack anybody in Eastern Europe in NATO, you attack Finland and Sweden, which is not in NATO, consider it an attack on us.	0
And he will understand that.	0
Secondly, I would tell the Chinese you don't own the South China Sea.	0
Stop hacking us.	0
And we're going to beef up our cyber command.	0
And we're going to be in a position to be able to take out your systems if you continue to do this.	0
Now let's move over into the Middle East.	0
The Egyptians, they know they're on their last legs there because of the attack from ISIS.	0
The Jordanians are — really have been our friends.	0
They know that they are at risk.	0
So do the Saudis.	0
So do the Gulf states.	0
They are our allies, really, or have similar aims, we need to bring them closer to us.	0
Turkey a critical avenue to the Middle East.	0
We have to bring them towards the West, and not towards the East.	0
Governor...	0
And we have a joint, good human intelligence.	0
That is called a semi-trip around the world.	0
And if you gave me more time, I'd finish the trip.	0
Governor, thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
Coming up, a final question and closing statements.	0
And take a look at this.	0
The volume of conversation on Facebook surrounding the remaining candidates over the last month.	0
Whether that conversation is good or bad, Donald Trump clearly dominates the field.	0
We'll be back with more of the Republican presidential debate live from Detroit.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate.	0
Let's get back at it.	0
Gentlemen, this is the last question of the night.	0
It has been a long time since our first debate, seven months ago in Cleveland.	0
A lot has transpired since then, obviously, including an RNC pledge that all of you signed agreeing to support the party's nominee and not to launch an independent run.	0
Tonight, in 30 seconds, can you definitively say you will support the Republican nominee, even if that nominee is Donald J. Trump?	0
Senator Rubio, yes or no?	0
I'll support the Republican nominee.	0
Mr. Trump?	0
Yes or no?	0
I'll support Donald if he's the Republican nominee, and let me tell you why.	0
Because the Democrats have two people left in the race.	0
One of them is a socialist.	0
America doesn't want to be a socialist country.	0
If you want to be a socialist country, then move to a socialist country.	0
The other one is under FBI investigation.	0
And not only is she under FBI investigation, she lied to the families of the victims of Benghazi, and anyone who lies to the families of victims who lost their lives in the service of our country can never be the commander- in-chief of the United States.	0
Senator...	0
We must defeat Hillary Clinton.	0
Senator Cruz, yes or no, you will support Donald Trump is he's the nominee?	0
Yes, because I gave my word that I would.	0
And what I have endeavored to do every day in the Senate is do what I said I would do.	0
You know, just on Tuesday, we saw an overwhelming victory in the state of Texas where I won Texas by 17 percent.	0
And I will say it was a powerful affirmation that the people who know me best, the people who I campaigned, who made promises that if you elect me, I'll lead the fight against Obamacare, I'll lead the fight against amnesty, I'll lead the fight against our debt, and I will fight for the Bill of Rights and your rights every day, that the people of Texas said you have kept your word, and that's what I'll do as president.	0
Governor Kasich, yes or no, would you support Donald Trump as the Republican nominee?	0
Yeah.	0
But — and I kind of think that, before it's all said and done, I'll be the nominee.	0
But let me also say...	0
[ applause ]	0
But let me also say, remember...	0
But your answer is yes?	0
But I'm the little engine that can.	0
And, yeah, look, when you're in the arena, and we're in the arena.	0
And the people out here watching — we're in the arena, we're traveling, we're working, we spend time away from our family, when you're in the arena, you enter a special circle.	0
And you want to respect the people that you're in the arena with.	0
So if he ends up as the nominee — sometimes, he makes it a little bit hard — but, you know, I will support whoever is the Republican nominee for president.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump, I'm going to ask you a version of the same question.	0
As we saw today with Mitt Romney, the #NeverTrump movement is gaining steam.	0
Some people are talking about contributing millions of dollars to try to stop you.	0
Again today, you raised the possibility that you might run as an independent if you feel you're treated unfairly by the Republican Party.	0
So I'm going to phrase the question that the other three people on this stage just got.	0
Can you definitively say tonight that you will definitely support the Republican nominee for president, even if it's not you?	0
Even if it's not me?	0
[ laughter ]	0
Let me just start off by saying...	0
Thirty seconds, sir.	0
... OK — that I'm very, very proud of — millions and millions of people have come to the Republican Party over the last little while.	0
They've come to the Republican Party.	0
And by the way, the Democrats are losing people.	0
This is a trend that's taking place.	0
It's the biggest thing happening in politics, and I'm very proud to be a part of it.	0
And I'm going to give them some credit, too, even though they don't deserve it.	0
But the answer is: Yes, I will.	0
Yes, you will support the nominee of the party?	0
Yes, I will.	0
Yes.	0
I will.	0
Candidates, it's now time for your closing statements.	0
Governor Kasich, we'll start with you.	0
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I love being here in Michigan, and I want to say to all of you here that I have a record of being able to solve some of the biggest problems.	0
It's not just talk, and it's not theory.	0
I did it in Washington by helping people get into a healthier economic situation.	0
I've done it in Ohio.	0
And as we've made progress in Ohio, we've left no one behind.	0
We've not left behind the mentally ill, the drug addicted, the working poor, the developmental disabled, and we have raised our minority community.	0
And as president of the United States, I will go back to Washington, I will take the formulas that I used, and I will — I will fix the problems in Washington, and you'll work with me as I send you power to fix your — your communities, your neighborhoods, your state, and together, we'll restore the spirit of America.	0
And I know you want that.	0
Thank you.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Rubio, 30 seconds, closing statement.	0
Well, I know this has been an unusual election cycle, as it continues, and there's a lot of problems in America, and people are truly hurting.	0
But this election is not just about confronting our problems; it's also about embracing our opportunities.	0
I believe the 21st century holds the potential to be the greatest era in the history of the United States, if we get this election right and if we act now.	0
If we do, if we do what needs to be done, we can leave our children as the freest and most prosperous Americans that have ever lived, and the 21st century can be the greatest era in the amazing story of America.	0
So I ask everyone to vote for me and join our effort at marcorubio.com.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Cruz, your closing statement?	0
I want to talk to every soldier and sailor and airman and Marine.	0
I want to talk to every mom and dad and sister and brother and son and daughter of someone fighting for this country.	0
For seven years, you've had a commander-in-chief that doesn't believe in you, that sends you into combat with rules of engagement that tie your arms behind your back.	0
That is wrong.	0
It is immoral.	0
And in January 2017, it will end.	0
I want to also talk to all the police officers and firefighters and first responders who have been left behind with this president.	0
Starting in January 2017, I will have your back.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump, your closing statement.	0
Thank you.	0
I am going to bring jobs back to the United States like nobody else can.	0
We're going to fix our very depleted military.	0
We're going to take care of our vets.	0
We're going to strengthen our borders.	0
And you're going to be very, very proud of this country in just a few years if I'm elected president.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, sir.	0
And that will do it for the 11th Republican primary debate of the 2016 presidential race.	0
But the night is not over yet.	0
Not by a long shot.	0
"A special edition of ""The O'Reilly Factor"" is next."	0
And remember, Fox News has the race for the White House covered, all the way to the conventions and onto the general election.	0
Our thanks to Detroit and the crowd here.	0
Thank you again for joining us.	0
Have a great evening.	0
Wow, thank you so much.	0
Hello, West Virginia.	0
What a place.	0
You know, we only won West Virginia by 42 points last time.	0
42 points.	0
You know what that is?	0
That's like -- did anyone ever hear of 42 points -- and we're going to better this time, OK?	0
But I'm thrilled to be back in this great state.	0
I love this state with thousands of hard working American patriots.	0
And what job numbers we had today.	0
Did you hear?	0
Did you hear?	0
We're going to that.	0
They all say speak about the economy.	0
Speak about the economy.	0
Well, we have the greatest economy in the history of our country... but sometimes it's not as exciting to talk about the economy, right?	0
Because we have a lot of other things to talk about.	0
Also, very important, the economy I unbelievable.	0
You know it better than anybody because your state under our great Governor Big Jim Justice wherever he may be.	0
Where is he?	0
Where's big Jim?	0
He's around here someplace.	0
One thing you can't miss him.	0
There he is.	0
You can't miss him.	0
He's got to be 6'11 and he's up there in the weight, but I won't get into it.	0
He's the greatest.	0
But I'm going to introduce him in a second.	0
But we're here to celebrate our amazing achievements together, to make America's incredible comeback continuing and we will.	0
Right now we're moving full speed ahead like nobody thought was possible.	0
They did not think it was possible.	0
They did not think it.	0
In just four days -- so important.	0
Because you have a great candidate.	0
You have a couple of great candidates.	0
Carol is a great candidate also.	0
You know that.	0
Carol Miller.	0
In just four days the people of West Virginia are going to send Carol Miller to the House and Patrick Morrisey to the Senate so we making America great again.	0
This election will decide whether we build on the extraordinary prosperity that we've unleashed.	0
Nobody can believe what's happened.	0
Or whether we let the radical Democrats take control of Congress and take a giant wrecking ball to our economy and to our future.	0
America now has the best economy in the history of our country, and we want to keep it that way.	0
In last month alone we added -- this just came out a few hours ago -- 250,000 jobs.	0
That's in the month of October, by the way.	0
That's for one month.	0
And nearly half a million Americans returned to the workforce.	0
We've created 4.5 million new jobs since the election, a number that was unthinkable.	0
If I would have said that during the campaign, oh they would have given me a hard time.	0
They would have said Pinocchio, you know, they do the whole thing.	0
Oh boy.	0
And we've lifted 4.3 million Americans off of food stamps.	0
The unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in over 50 years.	0
More Americans are working today -- think of this -- than ever before.	0
More American today, right now, this hour, are working than ever before in the history of our country.	0
How good is that?	0
How do you lose that debate?	0
When we're debating a lefty, how do you lose the debate when they're looking at you and say well, we're going to look at jobs.	0
But more Americans in the history of our country.	0
I mean that to me is -- here's another one.	0
African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans unemployment have all reached the lowest levels in the history of our country.	0
How do you lose that in a debate?	0
How do you lose that in a debate?	0
It's always nice.	0
You know, when you go into a debate it is nice to have the facts on your side.	0
It's going to be very tough to beat.	0
Wages are rising and you know it's -- it's been incredible.	0
And it just got announced they're going at the fastest pace in much more than a decade and wages went up.	0
First time in a long time.	0
They haven't gone up.	0
People were making more money 19 years ago.	0
I used to talk about it during the campaign.	0
Where people had single jobs and they were making more money than they had with two and three jobs today.	0
And now for the first time wages are going up, and they're going up nicely, and people have a choice of lots of different jobs.	0
And right here in West Virginia jobless claims reached the lowest level in the history of your state.	0
Is that good?	0
No wonder I won by 42 points.	0
No wonder.	0
But then it was just talk.	0
Remember?	0
When I came, I was campaigning.	0
What did you know?	0
"I mean, it was another, ""Can you believe politicians?"""	0
I'm a politician.	0
I guess.	0
I have to say.	0
Am I a politician?	0
But I said things.	0
And we overperformed, let's put it that way.	0
We overperformed.	0
And West Virginia's very happy, and that coal is coming back and our miners are working again, folks.	0
They're working again.	0
After years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country.	0
And as you know very well, because you look at your wallet, Republicans passed a massive tax cut for working families, and we will soon follow it up with another 10 percent tax cut for the middle class.	0
We've ended the war on beautiful, clean coal and we're putting our coal miners back to work.	0
That you know better than anybody.	0
Remember when my opponent in the last race went to another state about four weeks before she got to West Virginia?	0
And she was bragging, how she was going to put the coal miners out of work?	0
Remember that?	0
Remember that?	0
"And I said, ""You know?"	0
"I don't think this is going to play well in four weeks."""	0
She was in a non-coal state, talking about how she was going to put the coal business out of business.	0
That didn't work.	0
It's doing great.	0
And countries are buying our coal, and Asia now, you see what's happening?	0
Asia's buying massive amounts.	0
And you're back in business, folks.	0
You're back in business.	0
You wouldn't have been in business for another 12 months.	0
You were going to be out of business in 12 months.	0
You couldn't have -- you couldn't have sustained it.	0
I'm telling you, the timing was perfect.	0
Don't ever wait that long.	0
You were ready.	0
You were ready to go over the cliff.	0
That wasn't good.	0
But you're back in business.	0
Your miners are back.	0
And last year, our coal export skyrocketed by 65 percent.	0
Pretty amazing.	0
Under Republican leadership, America is booming.	0
America is thriving.	0
And America is winning.	0
Winning like never before, because we are finally putting America first.	0
It's been a long time.	0
But if Chuck Schumer -- cryin' Chuck -- and Nancy Pelosi... and the legendary Maxine Waters... take power, they will try to erase our gains and eradicate our progress.	0
That's what's going to happen.	0
They're going to work hard, and we will be fighting.	0
Oh, it will be -- it will be ridiculous, frankly.	0
It'll be bad for our country.	0
The Democrats -- and it could happen.	0
Could happen.	0
We're doing very well, and we're doing really well in the Senate.	0
But it could happen.	0
And you know what you do?	0
My whole life.	0
You know what I say?	0
Don't worry about it, I'll just figure it out.	0
Does that make sense?	0
I'll just figure it out.	0
The Democrats want to raise your taxes, restore job-killing regulations, shut down your coal mines -- and, by the way, they will shut down your coal mines.	0
You know that.	0
That's one thing I can guarantee.	0
We can talk about taxes, and I'll be here, veto, veto, veto.	0
But they ultimately want to raise your taxes very substantially.	0
But I can tell you, they will shut down your coal mines.	0
They want to take away your good health care, and essentially use socialism to turn America into Venezuela and Democrats want to totally open the borders.	1
They have the caravans, let them in.	0
Do you want to let them in?	0
Does anybody want to let them in?	0
I don't get it.	0
Think of it -- you campaign on open borders and higher taxes.	0
How the hell do you win that -- how do you win?	0
You're right.	0
Thank you, and we started the wall and built 1.6 billion and we have another 1.6 billion and then get another 1.6 billion.	1
I want to build it all at one time, but wait till -- wait till you see -- go home and see tonight what our great military is doing on the border.	1
Wait till you see.	0
Go home and enjoy it.	0
So the Democrats want to invite caravan after caravan and I don't know if you know -- you see the big caravan coming in?	1
Three more are forming and you know what we give to these countries?	0
Hundreds of millions of dollars to Honduras and to El Salvador, right?	0
We have -- to others we give hundreds of millions of dollars.	0
Do you know what they to give?	0
Nothing -- nothing.	0
They give us nothing.	0
They give us nothing.	0
That's going to be stopping, that's going to be stopping.	0
But caravan after caravan is forming unvetted, illegal aliens trying to flood into our country on your dollar, over whelming your schools, depleting your resources, and endangering your community.	1
Homeland Security has just confirmed that members of the lawless caravan, the one you've been watching, come from 20 different countries and influet among them criminals and gang members convicted of crimes ranging from armed robbery to sexual assault.	0
And I don't know if you saw the one -- they interviewed him yesterday and he was asking for pardon.	0
Didn't speak English and the nice young -- I guess reporter was saying oh, (inaudible) and what was it for?	0
And essentially it was for murder who wants -- and he's in the caravan.	0
This is what we have -- and you look -- you look at him, you look like nice, no, no murder, right?	0
You saw that, good I hope you saw that.	0
And then they gave me a hard time because I put it up on Twitter and they gave me a hard time.	0
They said you shouldn't be doing that, that's not nice.	0
And I say, all I'm doing is just telling the trust, what can I say.	0
Republicans want strong borders, no drugs, no gangs, and no caravans.	0
The choice in this election could not be more simple, a Republican Congress means more jobs and less crime.	0
A Democrat Congress means more crime and less jobs.	0
That's pretty good, that's nice and simple, doesn't get simpler than that.	0
So this Tuesday you have to go out -- I know in West Virginia you tend to vote on Tuesday more so than I guess you could do the early thing, but everyone here likes to go out -- me too.	0
There's something nice about its called Election Day.	0
We're all old fashioned.	0
That's why we get along.	0
That's why we get along, but you have to go out on Tuesday and vote.	0
And I'll tell you, Patrick's going to be fantastic.	0
And you know what, he'll always vote for us.	0
Not for me, for us.	0
He'll always -- he's not going to be voting with Schumer or Pelosi and open borders and all the things that they want.	0
And we're honored to be joined by a friend of mine who I just mentioned before because he is one great gentlemen.	0
You know, he's a very, very successful man before he did this and he did it, and he made a mistake.	0
He ran as a Democrat.	0
And he didn't like it, and now he's a happy man and the Republican Party loves him.	0
Big Jim Justice, your governor.	0
Where is Jim?	0
Thank you, Jim.	0
Big Jim, you're doing a great job -- stay there, Jim.	0
Just relax.	0
Just relax.	0
Just relax, but I'll tell you what, are you enjoying being governor, Jim?	0
The people love you.	0
65 percent up, coal exports, 65 and he works on it hard.	0
Thank you, Jim for being here.	0
Thanks for your support.	0
We love -- we love our governor.	0
Thank you, Jim.	0
And another great friend of mine, somebody that has always been there, just always been there.	0
And she is a fighter.	0
She is very strong, tough but a great woman.	0
He says Melania, that's true also.	0
That's true, because surely I could say Melania too.	0
Because she's been great.	0
Great first lady, I will say that.	0
And if you think it's easy being a first lady and married to me, it's not that easy.	0
She's fantastic.	0
But Senator Shelley Moore Capito, she was -- where is Shelley?	0
Thanks, Shelley.	0
Great job.	0
Really a fantastic job, I appreciate it.	0
Always there for us, always wanting to vote for West Virginia.	0
Also joining us is Tim Armstead, who is running as you know for Supreme Court.	0
A man who is highly respected and I just want to put a little word out, he's going for that extension.	0
You know what an extension is, I guess you do a good job, you're supposed to be extended.	0
And he has done so, Tim, wherever you may be -- where's Tim?	0
Good luck, Tim.	0
Good luck, Tim.	0
Thank you.	0
OK?	0
And Jim specifically said you mind doing that, he's a good man, right?	0
He is a good man.	0
Thank you, good luck.	0
Do you have any opposition -- any strong opposition?	0
It's not strong, it's opposition but not strong.	0
Nobody's going to beat you, Tim.	0
Not after this anyway.	0
Thank you, Tim.	0
But I'm especially proud to introduce the next person who has really become (inaudible).	0
And he's just -- he is a bundle of energy.	0
He doesn't stop.	0
You know, he's tied right now.	0
They're tied in the polls, it's very close.	0
It's very close.	0
And I have to say, I like Joe.	0
The problem is I'm just not going to get Joe's vote.	0
I'm just not going to get it.	0
I like him; he's a friend of mine.	0
I'm just not going to get his vote.	0
Even with Justice Kavanaugh, you know, I called Joe.	0
"I said, ""Joe, do me a favor."	0
"I'd like you to vote."""	0
"He said, ""well, I may."	0
"I may."""	0
But no, but you got to vote before I win, not after we have the vote because it was a real question because nobody has ever been treated worse that Judge Brett Kavanaugh at the time now Justice Kavanaugh.	0
Nobody, nobody.	0
Get got blindsided like nobody ever got blindsided.	0
What happened to him is disgraceful and what the Democrats did and the way they played that way a disgrace, right?	0
A disgrace.	0
"And Joe said, ""I'll think about it."	0
"I'll think about it."""	0
"I said, ""Joe, I don't want you to vote after we get the votes,"" because I didn't know we were going to have the votes without any Democrats."	0
"We didn't get one Democratic vote, so I said, ""Joe, I need the vote like today."""	0
This was a few days before the vote.	0
Well, let me think about it.	0
Let me think about it.	0
I want to wait to do it.	0
OK, because there's nobody smoother than Joe, you understand.	0
There's nobody smoother than Joe.	0
And, no.	0
He's much smoother than Schumer actually.	0
Crying Chuck, right, right?	0
When he wants something, he cries.	0
But I've never seen him cry before, then he cried.	0
"But Joe said, ""all right, let me think about it."	0
"Let me think about it."""	0
And then it came time to vote, and as you know we got the vote.	0
And when that final vote was just coming out, Joe waited about one-tenth of one second.	0
Now it means that Justice Kavanaugh was going to be Justice Kavanaugh, right?	0
We had all the votes, so we didn't need Joe's vote.	0
And he pressed that button.	0
I think it was about one-eighth of one second after we had the final vote from Susan Collins, who did us a good job, good job.	0
She did a good job.	0
Really did.	0
"And it was really a tough period of time, but Joe -- I said, ""Joe, that doesn't count."""	0
It doesn't count because if we would have needed the vote it was not going to happen.	0
Does that make any sense?	0
Do you guys understand that?	0
"I said, ""Joe, do it before we have the vote."	0
I think we've got the vote.	0
"Do it before we have the vote."""	0
"And he said, ""let me think."	0
"Let me think."""	0
"And then when I spoke to him later he tried to say, ""but I was watching for that one-eighth of a second."	0
"I was watching."""	0
But he didn't do it.	0
He didn't do it.	0
And I'll tell you what.	0
Patrick Morrisey, I built up your coal business and it's going to get a lot better by the way.	0
A lot.	0
As much as you're doing and as good as you're doing, if you look at what's happening, if you look at other countries wanting our coal -- and I'll tell you, which buys a lot of coal from West Virginia.	0
Do you know that?	0
Vietnam -- I was with the Prime Minister and the president.	0
You know, when you're with -- well, like when you're the President of the United States -I went to Vietnam, I went to various places in Asia -- but where you're the president here, you're not greeted by a president.	0
You're greeted by a president and the Prime Minister.	0
They have both.	0
And they said they buy their coal now, because of me, from West Virginia.	0
Well, that's good.	0
But I -- something I didn't know -- I learned a lot since then.	0
That was six months ago -- they said it is -- they've used coal for a long time.	0
They said it's the finest coal in the world.	0
It's the finest coal in the world.	0
They have a lot of options, but they said it's the finest coal.	0
"I said, ""good, if I'm never like around the people, which I expect to be a lot, I will explain that."""	0
But you -- do you understand?	0
Do the miners know what I'm saying what I say that?	0
The finest -- see, somebody like me coming from 5th Avenue.	0
What the hell do I know about that?	0
All I know is I want to put my miners back to work.	0
And I know it works.	0
And I know -- and I know for national security reasons -- another reason -- coal is something we have to have.	0
We have to have.	0
But they said it's the finest coal in the world.	0
I thought that was great.	0
Might as well tell you.	0
Now I've told you and I don't feel guilty any longer.	0
But I just want to introduce your next United States senator from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey.	0
Patrick, come on up.	0
Wow.	0
Isn't this president making West Virginia great again?	0
Thank you, Mr. President, for coming back again.	0
I have to tell you, last night I had a debate with Senator Joe Manchin.	0
And you know what he said?	0
He attacked -- he attacked me for supporting President Trump.	0
Well I will never apologize for defending President Trump, nor will I kneel to alter of Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer or Nancy Pelosi.	0
I ask for your vote today.	0
President Trump needs a staunch ally in the U.S. Senate.	0
I will be that ally.	0
But I need your vote.	0
I need your help.	0
Go online.	0
patrickmorrisey.com, volunteer, donate, help me defeat the Manchin Schumer ATM machine.	0
Mr. President, thank you for everything you've done for West Virginia.	0
You've been huge in our state and I look forward to winning and working with this president.	0
Thank you and god bless.	0
What a good job that was.	0
So I said how's Patrick Morrisey doing to some of my friends, two people that live here, they -- I said how's he doing.	0
They said he is the Energizer bunny.	0
He is all over the state.	0
You know, sometimes you'll ask that question about candidates -- I won't mention names -- and how're they doing -- oh, they're lazy, they're not working.	0
They're not working.	0
Well they couldn't say that about me in 2016 because (inaudible).	0
Even these people say he's got a lot of energy.	0
This man has a lot of energy.	0
And just finally on Joe, I have to say that he was all for Hillary Clinton.	0
He was for Hillary Clinton.	0
She was against coal, she was against the miners, she got no support in this state, and yet Joe was totally in her camp. So that sort of -- that sort of tells you -- you know, Patrick -- as your attorney general, Patrick --	0
[Audience chants Lock her up]	0
That's up to Patrick and he won't do that.	0
Because he's just focused on one thing, becoming your next United States senator.	0
That's what he's doing.	0
But Patrick's been tough on crime and a fierce defender of the rule of law.	0
And as your senator, he'll always be the tireless champion for the great people of this great state.	0
He loves this state.	0
And your vote on election day -- thank you very much.	0
He's not my type, but I like him anyway, folks.	0
He's a rough looking guy.	0
But you're going to decide.	0
And -- and everybody's watching West Virginia.	0
Because you know, this was a race -- when it started I won by a lot.	0
And -- and a lot of people said that this was not one that was going to happen.	0
This was a while ago, and then Patrick came along and did unbelievably in the primary.	0
He has won statewide a number of times so he's been -- he's been through it but he's won statewide.	0
He knows your state as well as anybody I guess and a lot of people said well, I don't know.	0
It's almost -- lets sort of focus on other states, which were also doing very well I have to say.	0
And then all the sudden we see polls and it's tied -- it's in one case he's up a little bit, another case he's down a little bit but I mean its right there.	0
Let's assume it's sided.	0
It's going to be whoever gets the people going to the polls on Tuesday.	0
The whole country is watching the great state of West Virginia.	0
It's going to be a very exciting moment.	0
They asked me -- the fake news media asks me recently, like a couple of days it will say, what race are you watching?	0
Oh I'm watching Florida, I'm watching all of the red, but I said watch West Virginia.	0
It's going to be very inter -- and they said what?	0
I said watch West Virginia, the great place.	0
So you're going to decide, maybe, which party controls the United States Senate.	0
It's a very powerful love and a vote for Joe is a vote for Schumer.	0
It's a vote for a majority leader who will be not good and we don't want to put anti coal -- these are anti coal people.	0
We are -- they are anti coal people and they vote anti coal and frankly, that's what you're getting and if that's what you end up with it's your vote, not mine.	0
Remember that, remember that.	0
Joe will never be with us in terms of the vote, he'll be with us in a lot of ways.	0
We'll go to dinner with him, we'll take him out, we like him but he's never going to vote for it so I just want you to remember that, ok?	0
Ok, let's get on with it.	0
Let's get on with it, let's get on with it.	0
Patrick, I think if he ever voted against us I'll come back here, I'll say we're going to impeach him -- impeach, we will impeach Patrick.	0
He'll never do it.	0
He loves the people too much.	0
He loves your industry too much.	0
He understands the state too well.	0
It's not going to happen.	0
So if you don't want the Democrat mob like you saw in the Senate, vote for Patrick.	0
Just vote for him.	0
Finally, we're thrilled to be joined by the next member of Congress, a person who you really do like a lot I have to say, and she's doing well and I thought I'd just call her up for a second.	0
Third district in West Virginia, Carol Miller, she's done a fantastic job, Carol.	0
It is terrific to be up here sharing a stage with our great President.	0
West Virginia loves President Trump.	0
President Trump, thank you for all of the support you have given my campaign.	0
I can't wait to be Congress to work with you.	0
You can always count on me to put America first, fight for coal, grow our economy, protect Social Security and Medicare, embrace our veterans, and strengthen our borders.	0
Mr. President, thank you so much for your commitment to West Virginia.	0
God bless you and God bless our country.	0
Thank you, Carol.	0
Be careful.	0
[Audience chats USA]	0
So just to tell you that Carol is great on jobs, she loves our coal miners.	0
You know that.	0
She'll always support our vets.	0
She's very strong on our vets.	0
We love our vets.	0
Our military and our law enforcement.	0
And Carol's opponent is a radical left winger named Richard Ojeda.	0
If you don't want to be saying the words Speaker Pelosi for the next two years, who will end your coal business, then you better vote for Carol Miller.	0
Thank you, Carol.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, Carol.	0
She's doing great.	0
If Democrats gain power, they'll also be planning a takeover of American healthcare and that would be socialism, what they want to do.	0
The Democrat plan would obliterate Medicare and eliminate Medicare Advantage for more than 121,000 West Virginia seniors who depend on it.	0
Republicans will protect Medicare for our great seniors who earned it and by the way, who paid for it.	0
Right?	0
You paid for it.	0
And Republicans will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.	0
We're all doing that.	0
I listened to President Obama speak today.	0
He had a very small crowd.	0
I have to be honest with you.	0
They don't tell you that.	0
You know?	0
They don't tell you that.	0
We had -- in Houston we had the biggest thing you've ever seen and they were saying Donald Trump spoke today in front of a few thousand people.	0
Few thousand?	0
We had over 100,000 people that wanted to come.	0
We had 22,000 people in the arena.	0
We had thousands and thousands of people outside of the arena.	0
Donald Trump spoke today in front of a crowd of a few thousand people.	0
Can you believe it?	0
It's called the fake news, folks.	0
But I head President Obama speak today.	0
I had to listen -- I was in the plane; I had nothing else to do.	0
I heard him talk about telling the truth.	0
He was talking about you have to tell the truth.	0
And yet 28 times he said you can keep your doctor if you like your doctor.	0
You can keep your plan if you like your plan.	0
They were all lies.	0
Over and over again you heard that.	0
Just used it to pass a terrible healthcare plan that we are decimating strike by strike.	0
You saw what happened to the individual mandate, the most unpopular part.	0
And we actually had Obamacare killed except for one Republican vote and any Democrat -- one Democrat and we would have had it obliterated and you would have had great healthcare.	0
But we're doing a lot to make it a lot better until we do get rid of it.	0
Then I heard him talk about the freedom of the press.	0
We have to maintain the press.	0
We have to love those people.	0
Love.	0
Except that nobody was worse to the President Obama.	0
Nobody.	0
In fact, he even used, as I remember, the Justice Department to go after reporters.	0
Remember?	0
Remember?	0
When he's talking about how I should be nice to the fake news.	0
No thank you.	0
And let's not forget President Obama's false promises about our trade deals.	0
Just one.	0
His administration promised that with South Korea we would create in a trade deal 70,000 jobs.	0
But instead of that, it killed over 100,000 jobs in our country.	0
It was a horrible deal, which by the way, I have totally renegotiated and made it a good deal.	0
Lie after lie, broken promise after broken promise, that's what he did.	0
Unlike President Obama, we live by a different moto.	0
It's called promises made, promises kept.	0
And we've done more than we ever said we would.	0
We said we were going to do things and we've done a lot more and they will be the first to tell you tell.	0
Democrats' plan -- that's right, the magic wand, right?	0
Remember, he said you need a magic wand to produce manufacturing jobs.	0
Well, we just hit almost 600,000.	0
Democrats' plan to destroy healthcare, also includes raiding Medicare to fund benefits for illegal immigrants.	0
I'm sure you don't mind that.	0
As we speak, Democrats are openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to violate our laws and to over run our borders.	0
They want to sign illegal aliens up for free healthcare, free welfare, free education and the right to vote.	0
Otherwise, they don't get much.	0
Illegal immigration cost American tax payers more than $100 billion every single year, more than 20 times the entire state budget of the sate of West Virginia.	0
We need to use our precious resources to help low income Americans who respect our laws, not caravans who break in to our country and break our laws.	0
We don't want that.	0
We don't want that, I'm sorry.	0
Now, we don't mind if they come in, but they have to come in legally.	0
Democrat immigration policies not only drain our treasury, but they threaten our communities.	0
Nearly 100 percent of heroin in the United States enters though the southern border, along with roughly 90 percent of cocaine, the majority of meth and a substantial portion of the ultra lethal fentanyl killing a youth drug, fentanyl -- the worst.	1
These drugs kill more than 70,000 Americans every single year.	0
Last year alone, our brave ICE officers who they want to get rid of by the way, these are tough, great, strong patriots.	0
We need strength, arrested more than 127,000.	0
Think of that, 127,000-- Aliens- With criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 48,000 assaults, 12,000 sex crimes and 1,800 homicides.	0
They want to get rid of them, let's get rid of ICE.	0
What are these people thinking?	0
That's why you have to have Patrick Morrisey and Carol.	0
You have to vote them in on Tuesday.	0
You have to do it.	0
Yet Democrats want to abolish ICE, they want to turn America in to a giant sanctuary for criminal aliens, drug dealers and MS-13 killers.	0
And by the way, we remove thousands over the last little bit less than two years that I've been here.	0
Thousands and thousands of MS-13 gang members have been thrown the hell out of the country.	0
A blue wave equals a crime wave -- you don't hear too much about the blue wave anymore though, do you?	0
Remember a couple of months -- oh, the blue wave, oh the blue wave.	0
Now they don't talk -- you know, I'm not saying they don't squeak it by, maybe because they got of races and I can't go everywhere.	0
Can't go everywhere.	0
But now they're talking about (inaudible).	0
I mean, you know let's see what happens.	0
Going t be an interesting day at the office.	0
You remember that election two years ago?	0
There were a lot of really happy people that night, but there were some that were slightly -- not too happy.	0
Cry, baby, cry.	0
A red wave equals jobs and safety.	0
Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens.	0
And Republicans will always stand with the heroes of ICE, border patrol and our great law enforcement.	0
You have great law enforcement right here... in West Virginia.	0
I look at those people -- I'm looking at your law enforcement right there.	0
I feel very safe.	0
Thank you, fellas.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, fellas.	0
And, yes, the wall is happening.	0
It should happen immediately.	0
It's moving beautifully.	0
The design is beautiful, and it's happening.	0
And some communities in California, of all places, down to miss San Diego, we're just about finishing it up.	0
But they're demanding the wall.	0
They want the wall.	0
"I said, ""Let's not give it to them because then they'll put pressure on their government to build it,"" right?"	0
"Now once we build it for them, they'll say, ""We shouldn't have a wall."""	0
But they already have their wall.	0
That's the way it works, folks.	0
Border security is also a woman's issue.	0
You know, they keep talking about women.	0
Trump with women.	0
Remember the last election?	0
Well, Donald Trump won't do very well with women.	0
I did great with women.	0
Look at the (inaudible).	0
I did great.	0
Right?	0
I did great with women.	0
"In fact, at the end, when I won, they -- they said, ""You know, a statistic we got wrong, women really came out for Trump."""	0
"I said, ""Thank you."	0
"Thank you."""	0
Same thing now.	0
Because women want safe neighborhoods for their families, right?	0
They want great schools, health care for their children.	0
They want to keep drug dealers and predators and traffickers -- how about the traffickers?	0
These are human traffickers.	0
These are the worst scum in the world.	0
They want them out of our country.	0
And we do that.	0
The Democrats don't do that.	0
They want the open borders.	0
Fly right in, folks.	0
Come on in.	0
We don't care who the hell you are, come on in.	0
Think of it, 300 people.	0
You know, we're getting a lot of heat because, I was saying, there were some bad people in that caravan.	0
Right?	0
So we checked, 300 people.	0
I read them out to you.	0
That is one more reason why women all across the nation are going to show up and vote Republican on Tuesday.	0
They want security.	0
They want safety.	0
They don't want to have these people coming in.	0
They don't want to have -- some of these people are just horrible people.	0
You have to see the crimes they've committed.	0
This election is about security, and it's about prosperity.	0
For years, you watched as we let foreign countries plunder our wealth and shutter our factories and steal our jobs.	0
And you watched helplessly.	0
We don't watch helplessly any more.	0
Those days are over.	0
We've added half a million manufacturing jobs -- soon to be 600,000 -- since the election, including 32,000 in just the last month.	0
These were jobs that the previous administration said would never happen.	0
And these are great jobs.	0
These are among our greatest jobs.	0
Manufacturing jobs.	0
And thanks to our tariffs that we put on steel that was coming in, and they were dumping it all over the place and destroying our steel companies and our aluminum industry.	0
Roaring back.	0
Steel industry is roaring back.	0
And for the miners, by the way, in Minnesota and other places, we're grabbing that iron ore and they're making steel.	0
And the hottest industry -- one of the hottest industries now, look at what's happened to steel.	0
Steel, like coal, it was going off the cliff.	0
You weren't going to have a steel industry in this country and we need it.	0
Certain industries you need, you need steel.	0
You don't have steel -- you need it for defense.	0
What are we going to go incase we're -- hopefully we'll never have a problem, ok.	0
I made the military -- it'll be stronger than it ever was before ever and that's why you won't have a problem.	0
You know, if you don't want to have a problem, make your military much stronger than anybody else ever thought possible, but we need steel.	0
How about this?	0
We don't have any -- so see our steel bills were finished.	0
We were going down -- you guys understand that, but we were going down.	0
Now it's so hot, but you need steel.	0
There are certain industries you have to have -- you need defense.	0
You don't have it -- you have purpose, what are we gonna do?	0
We have a conflict and we call China?	0
We need more steel.	0
Please, please, could we have some more steel?	0
It's ridiculous.	0
Our steel industry is roaring back and we're putting billions of dollars in our treasury because we're charging 25 percent tax on those people that dump their steel.	0
They dump is all over the place in order to destroy our steel industry and the miner are coming back, in this case, since the iron ore and it's coming out and it's gonna -- it's a beautiful thing to see.	0
I mean we've rebuilt -- we really started that about eight months ago, really heavy started it.	0
I wanted to get my feet a little bit wet as President, right.	0
We started it about eight months ago.	0
It's incredible.	0
The head of U.S. Steel called up, he said I've never said anything like it -- what you've been able to do in such a short period of time.	0
They're building seven new plants, they're expanding plants.	0
Nucor -- Nucor, a big steel company is building brand new plants $750 million, $900 million brand new plants.	0
It's incredible.	0
They haven't been built in years.	0
Last month, I announced that we're replacing the horrible NAFTA deal, one of the worst -- stupidest deals ever made with an incredible brand new U.S. Mexico Canada agreement.	0
We've taken the toughest ever action to crack down on China's abusive trade practices and we're doing very nicely.	0
We'll probably make a deal.	0
They want to make a deal.	0
America is being respected again.	0
We're respected as a country again.	0
We were not respected for a long time.	0
We were laughed at just like these stupid immigration laws.	0
The whole world looks at it, they laugh, they said what is this all about?	0
A person comes into our country -- another country throws them out.	0
Hey, get out.	0
You're not supposed to be here, you have to go through a process.	0
You know what we do?	0
We take them -- we can't do anything -- we bring them through a court proceeding.	0
We take a person who walks onto our property we have a big deal -- a court case.	0
They have lawyers, we have lawyers and what happens is then they go away and is supposed to come back for the trial.	0
Could be two years, three years later and they disappear into the country never to be seen again.	0
There's no trial, very few people come back -- almost none.	0
This is the procedure.	0
This is the law.	0
This is crazy.	0
And the Democrats don't want to change it because they know its chaos and a disaster and they think that's good, but I think it's good for us because I think they overplayed their hand.	0
And how these caravans were formed, you'll have to figure that out.	0
But they overplayed their hand too, assuming they had something to do with it but it was very well organized, amazingly, in Honduras and the different places very well.	0
And you know they came up and I'll tell you people are really energized.	0
They're energized about that, they're energized about the way justice, as you know Kavanaugh.	0
Just as Kavanaugh was treated, they're energized when they saw the way he was -- Brett Kavanaugh -- when they saw the way he was treated, they're energized about a lot of things.	0
They want to see us be a great, respected country.	0
And that's what's happening.	0
We have taken bold action to reduce the price of prescription drugs to help critically ill patients get life saving treatments.	0
We passed something that they've been trying to pass for many, many years.	0
It's called right to try where you can try stuff.	0
That isn't out yet, but it's looking promising.	0
That's such an important thing.	0
They've been trying to pass that for decades.	0
I got it done.	0
After years of surging premiums, the cost of healthcare is finally coming down.	0
We're getting the cost of healthcare down.	0
And last month, I proudly signed the largest bill to fight the opioid epidemic.	0
It's the largest bill in American history.	0
We passed Veterans Choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor.	0
And the landmark VA accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreat our veterans will be held accountable.	0
You are fired.	0
Get out.	0
We secured $700 billion and $716 billion to fully rebuild the United States military.	0
And we gave our great warriors, I know you have some of them right here.	0
And I know they don't care about this, they couldn't care less, they don't mind; maybe we'll take it back.	0
We gave them the largest pay raise they've had in more than a decade.	1
OK?	0
Our military.	0
They deserve it.	0
And my direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth ranch of the American armed forces, the Space force.	0
I was (inaudible) the United States from the horrible one sided Iran nuclear deal.	0
And just today, we riposted all sanctions that were lifted under that horrible deal.	0
Just today.	0
We now have in place the toughest ever sanctions on a corrupt regime in Iran.	0
We've recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem.	0
Many, many presidents said they were going to do that, they never got it done.	0
I got it done.	0
I even got it built.	0
I already built the embassy.	0
$1 billion under budget, right?	0
One billion.	0
One billion under budget.	0
It was supposed to go as $1.1 billion, we go tit done for less than $500,000.	0
That's not bad, that's -- it's a long story, I won't bother telling you this.	0
But it's pretty amazing.	0
And there are many things like that.	0
Together, we have made extraordinary progress.	0
And we're just getting started.	0
But the democrats want to turn back the clock and put America in reverse and give power back to corrupt, selfish ruling class people.	0
And they want to take the power back for themselves.	0
But we are not going backwards, we're going forwards.	0
I need your vote for a republican house.	0
I need your vote for a republican senate.	0
So we can continue this incredible movement, the greatest political movement in the history of our country.	0
And I say it all the time.	0
And they can challenge it.	0
Greatest movement in the history of our country.	0
You know, Bernie Sanders had a reasonably good movement.	0
But Hilary clipped him.	0
Yes, don't look in that one, he got clipped.	0
But we would've beaten him easy.	0
He would've been easier.	0
Crazy Bernie.	0
We will keep on cutting your taxes, reducing your regulations and raising your incomes.	0
We will protect Medicare and your social security.	0
Remember what I said during the debates?	0
Everyone was talking about cutting the social security and all -- I said we're not touching your social security.	0
We haven't touched it in a long time now.	0
We will defend your right to free speech, religious liberty and we will continue to confirm judges who will interpret the Constitution as written.	0
We will fully secure the border, we will pass case law, we stop sanctuary cities, we will stop catch and release, and visa lottery, and chain migration, and we will keep the criminals, drug dealers, and terrorists the hell out of our country.	0
We will lift millions of our citizens from Welfare to work.	0
Dependents to independents and poverty to prosperity, that's what's going to happen.	0
For years you watched as your leaders apologized for America.	0
Now you have a President who is standing up for American.	0
We're standing up for your values, we're standing up for West Virginia, and we are proudly standing up for our national anthem.	0
To continue our incredible momentum, I need you to get your family, get your friends, get your neighbors, get your coworkers and go out and vote Republican for all of them and our two stars right here.	0
On Tuesday, I need the people of West Virginia to send a message to crying Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, and the radical Democrats by voting for Carol Miller and Patrick Morrisey.	0
Loyal citizens like you help build this country and together we are taking back our country, returning power to you -- the American people like we said we were going to do.	0
This great state was built by some of the toughest men and strongest woman ever to walk the face of the earth.	0
These proud West Virginia patriots braved the wilderness and defied the dangers to build a life and a home with their own two hands.	0
They didn't have a lot of money, they didn't have a lot of luxury but they all had one thing in common.	0
They love their families, they love their country, and they loved their God, right?	0
They loved their God.	0
They loved their God is right.	0
These courageous American's did not shed their blood, sweat and tears, so that we could sit at home will others try to erase their legacy, tear down our history, and destroy our proud American heritage.	0
For the sake of our freedom and for the sake our children we are going to work, we are going to fight, and we are going to win, win, win.	0
We will not bend.	0
We will not break.	0
We will never give in.	0
We will never give up.	0
We will never back down.	0
We will never surrender, and we will always fight on to victory, always, always.	0
Because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue.	0
We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God and together we will make America wealthy again.	0
Make America strong again.	0
Make American safe again and we will make America great again.	0
Thank you very much, West Virginia.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Wow, that is so beautiful.	0
Thank you.	0
What a great song, too, by the way.	0
Do we like that song?	0
I think so.	0
I think so.	0
I'd like to use it all the time, but it only seems to work well in West Virginia, right?	0
So I am thrilled to be back with all of my friends in the great state of West Virginia.	0
Thank you.	0
This was a big victory.	0
We won by 42 points.	0
That's pretty big, right?	0
Forty-two points over a Democrat, right, over a Democrat.	0
They didn't do too well.	0
And the people of West Virginia, they're loyal, they're hard-working, they're true American patriots.	0
Remember that.	0
They are great people.	0
They're my friends.	0
"[Audience member calls ""We Love You""]"	0
Thank you very much.	0
I love you too -- guy.	0
It's a guy, but I love you, too.	0
You're proud of our country, you're proud of our history.	0
And unlike the NFL, you always honor and cherish our great American flag.	0
It was just announced by ESPN that rather than defending our anthem, our beautiful, beautiful national anthem, and defending our flag, they've decided that they just won't broadcast when they play.	0
We don't like that.	0
So while the players are kneeling, some of them, not all of them at all, you're all proudly standing for our national anthem.	0
Thank you.	0
The ESPN thing was terrible, just came out.	0
Under our administration, America is winning again and America is being respected again all over the world.	0
It's America First.	0
This is the greatest economy that we've had in our history, the best.	0
Our steel mills are back.	0
They're roaring back.	0
We're making steel again.	0
United States Steel announced a massive infusion of cash.	1
They're opening up seven different plants.	1
Other steel companies all over the country, they're opening up plants.	0
People said steel will never be back.	0
Steel is back.	0
It's one of the hottest industries in our country because of what we've done with our tariffs.	0
They were dumping steel all over our country.	0
They were destroying our business.	0
They're not dumping so much anymore.	0
And if they do, they're paying a lot.	0
Our military will soon be stronger than it's ever been before.	0
We're taking care of our amazing veterans.	0
And I know this doesn't matter to you, but we are putting our great coal miners back to work.	0
Great people, great people, brave people, I don't know how the hell you do that.	0
I'll tell you.	0
You guys have a lot of courage but we love clean, beautiful, West Virginia coal.	0
We love it, right?	0
And you know that's indestructible stuff.	0
In times of war, in times of conflict, you can blow up those windmills.	0
They fall down real quick.	0
You can blow up those pipelines.	0
They go like this and you're not going to fix them too fast.	0
You can do a lot of things to those solar panels.	0
But you know what?	0
You can't hurt coal.	0
You can do whatever you want to coal, very important.	0
And we are working now on a military plan that's got to be something very special.	0
So I'm honored tonight to have a friend of mine.	0
He was a Democrat.	0
And I don't want to say because of me, let's say it's because of policy, he decided to become a Republican and he's a great Republican.	0
And I want to bring him up if I could.	0
Can I bring up your governor?	0
He is the largest, most beautiful man.	0
Governor Big Jim Justice.	0
OK.	0
I deputized you, did I not?	0
The other thing I know, you as West Virginians are appreciative people.	0
Now just think, we know what this great man right beside me has done for us.	0
Now let me say this: it's time for us to show that appreciation and deliver back.	0
We have to re-elect our House members and we cannot, whatever we do, to God above, we cannot put Ojeda on this man.	0
But it goes further than that.	0
Patrick Morrisey is a little behind right now.	0
He needs you.	0
He needs all of you.	0
He needs you to go out and be warriors and deputies for him.	0
He can win this, and this man needs him.	0
So I would say God bless this great man.	0
God bless this great country, and thank you for having me.	0
He's a big man.	0
He's all man, 6 foot 11.	0
I won't talk about the weight.	0
I don't know.	0
I don't know what the weight is.	0
I won't go there, but he is a big man and he's a great man.	0
He's a wonderful friend of mine.	0
That is really nice what he just said about the man that you want to be your next senator.	0
That's really nice.	0
Thank you very much, Jim.	0
Also, we have your senator, who's a special friend of mine.	0
She's been so helpful to me and so helpful to you, she loves your state, Shelley Moore Capito.	0
Congressman David McKinley, Alex Mooney, and Evan Jenkins.	0
And Evan, you put up one hell of a fight.	0
Thank you, Evan.	0
Boy, you are something; and your state GOP chairwoman, Melody Potter.	0
Melody?	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, Melody.	0
Also with us is a tremendous senator, somebody that's helped us do our agenda, which is Make America Great Again pretty much, and we have a lot of different names.	0
And you see Promises Made, Promises Kept.	0
They're copying it now, the Democrats.	0
They're copying it now Promises Made, Promises Kept.	0
They're copying it, but what are you going to do?	0
But this is a man that really -- he makes a promise that it's 100% good.	0
He's tremendous and done so much.	0
He's from a place called Colorado, and he's helping to lead our campaign to elect more Senate Republicans like the man we're going to elect in West Virginia, Cory Gardner.	0
Thank you, Cory.	0
Thank you, Cory, great job, doing a great job.	0
Thank you.	0
Then we're thrilled to be joined by the next House members from West Virginia's third congressional district, a woman that works very hard for you, Carol Miller.	0
Carol?	0
Thanks, Carol.	0
Finally, it's my great honor to introduce the person that we are here to support tonight, a tremendous gentleman.	0
I got to know him during the campaign.	0
He has got an energy.	0
It took me a little while to figure it out.	0
I have to be honest.	0
And once I got to see what was happening -- and Evan would be the first to tell you too -- he was so tough, he was so smart, he didn't stop.	0
He does not stop, and he's going to fight for you like nobody's ever fought for the people of West Virginia, your next senator, Patrick Morrisey.	0
Patrick, come up here.	0
Come up here, Patrick.	0
Come up here, Patrick.	0
Joe does have to go.	0
Let me just be clear.	0
Hey guys, I want to start out by thanking the president for coming back to wild and wonderful West Virginia for the sixth time.	0
Thank you.	0
Hey, how about this guy?	0
West Virginia's never seen anything like this.	0
We love you, Mr. President.	0
And I'll tell you this: we know that President Trump is making America great again.	0
But even more importantly, President Trump is making West Virginia great again.	0
Look, tonight, we're joined by some of the Mountain State's finest coal miners.	0
Can you stand up?A round of applause for our hard-working coal miners.	0
Donald Trump and I are fighting every day for our coal miners and the hard-working men and women of our state.	0
He's trying to get the man off your back, and I'm working every day to help him do it.	0
"[Audience member calls ""You're the man, Trump.""]"	0
Amen.	0
But I'll tell you what, one of the best ways I can help President Trump is to have you send me to the U.S. Senate, where I'll be a big ally of this president.	0
West Virginia needs to send a conservative fighter to the U.S.	0
Senate to help drain that swamp. Now ...	0
[Crowd Chants Drain the Swamp]	0
It's pretty good.	0
Now let me tell you a little bit.	0
I have an opponent in this race.	0
His name is Dishonest Liberal Joe Manchin.	0
And let me be clear, Liberal Joe is no supporter of this president.	0
Manchin strongly supported and voted for Hillary Clinton after -- right?	0
All right, hang on, hang on -- after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work.	0
Yes, that's pretty bad.	0
Manchin even called Hillary warm, compassionate, engaging, tough.	0
Can you actually believe that?	0
Let – Joe's got to go.	0
Joe has to go.	0
Liberal Joe no longer has West Virginia values.	0
Let's go through the record.	0
Manchin was for Obama.	0
Manchin was for Hillary.	0
Manchin is for radical gun control, Planned Parenthood.	0
He shills for EpiPen, and he opposed the Trump tax cuts.	0
Let me be clear -- pretty bad, right?	0
Remember, this is West Virginia.	0
We benefit as much or more than anyone from the Trump tax cuts.	0
Joe Manchin no longer has West Virginia values, period.	0
When I get to the U.S. Senate, I'm going to be a strong ally of President Trump.	0
I'm going to be the conservative fighter that you can rely on.	0
We're going to stand up for coal and our energy resources and we're going to tackle this opiate epidemic more aggressively than anyone.	0
It's my honor to be here tonight and be on the same stage with the president.	0
Mr. President, thank you for your leadership, your work, and for standing up for West Virginia.	0
Thank you, man.	0
Thank you.	0
Amen.	0
Together, we're all going help this guy make sure not only that we make West Virginia great again, we continue to make West Virginia great again.	0
Best way to do that?	0
Liberal Joe's got to go.	0
Guys, Joe's got to go.	0
And now I will turn this back over to the big man who you're here to see.	0
Amen, brother.	0
He's got energy.	0
He's got a lot of talent and he loves this place.	0
He loves the people and he's going to be fighting for you.	0
He doesn't sleep.	0
He's out campaigning.	0
I said how many days are you campaigning?	0
Because I said the last 60 days of my campaign every single day, we'd go out every single day as many stops as you could make humanly.	0
Humanly, he can't get tired.	0
He's got that same thing.	0
He's not going to get tired.	0
He's every single day and he's got a very special spark.	0
You see it and you know him.	0
Look, you know him.	0
He's done a hell of a job as your AG.	0
And you got to get him with us.	0
You got to get him with us.	0
He's going to bring it back home for the people of West Virginia.	0
So this November, voters in West Virginia will face a very simple choice.	0
A vote for Patrick Morrisey is truly a vote to make America great again.	0
He's going to vote.	0
And I like Joe, but Joe doesn't vote.	0
He just doesn't vote for us.	0
It's a vote for Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, their new leader Maxine Waters.	0
But between Waters and Pelosi, you have two people that are in charge of Congress.	0
They're not in favor of West Virginia.	0
They don't know that West Virginia exists.	0
They don't like coal.	0
They don't like energy.	0
[Audience calls We don't like her]	0
And they don't like her.	0
So when you cast your ballot for Congress in November, you aren't just voting for a candidate.	0
You're voting for which party controls the House and which party controls the Senate, so all these Congress people.	0
And I'll tell you, we have to get there.	0
We really have to get there.	0
So I'm going to be going out as many days as I can and I'm allowed to.	0
I have sort of a lid with all the Secret Service and all the fantastic people, but it sort of holds you back.	0
Maybe sometimes I'll just make a few trips without them.	0
We'll do them quietly.	0
But we're going to be out a lot.	0
We're going to a lot of different states, and I'm coming back here before the election.	0
And it's a very close election.	0
A lot of people don't realize there's a 6-point spread.	0
Six points could be ended by this evening.	0
He could be up by 12.	0
You've seen what's been happening.	0
We've had a good record of endorsements.	0
In Georgia, a man who was down 10.	0
I endorsed him a short while before the election -- good man, for governor -- and he won 70 to 30.	0
So I guess he picked up 45 or 50 points.	0
In Ohio recently there was -- he was up and then he went down a little bit.	0
We went there, and he won.	0
You know that, Balderson, good man, Congressman Balderson now, he won.	0
We won eight out of nine special elections.	0
Nobody talks about it.	0
They don't talk about it.	0
Eight out of nine special elections, and they don't want to talk about it.	0
And my record – and look, I don't want to brag about it, but man, do I have a good record of endorsement.	0
In Florida, we have a great candidate, his name is Ron DeSantis.	0
And he called me and asked whether or not I could endorse him, and I said let me check it out.	0
And he was a 3.	0
This was a few months ago.	0
He was a 3, and I gave him a nice shot and a nice little tweak, bing-bing, and he went from 3 to like 20-something.	0
And then I gave him my full and total endorsement, and he's now leading by, like, 19 points.	0
And that election is next week, leading in the primary.	0
He's a good man.	0
And so many others.	0
Staten Island, the Congressman Dan Donovan, he was down before the election.	0
We endorsed him.	0
I think he won by 24 points.	0
So if we can do just -- all my life, I've heard endorsements don't mean anything.	0
They said if you get an endorsement from Ronald Reagan -- we like Ronald Reagan -- it was a wonderful thing to have but it didn't move the needle.	0
And if you get an endorsement from a lot of people, it never really -- is that a correct statement?	0
If you look, Cory, Shelley, if you get an endorsement, it was nice to have, but it didn't mean anything.	0
These endorsements -- and I'm not saying it from my standpoint.	0
They're going 20, 30, 40, 50 points.	0
Fifty points, it's crazy.	0
And then you watch the news, will this endorsement mean anything?	0
Let me tell you, it's going to mean a lot.	0
And I mean a lot.	0
And I don't care, I just wanna, we have to get senators in.	0
We've got really no majority.	0
We have -- if you really look at it, probably we could say 49-49, 51-49.	0
We have some people that aren't able to vote.	0
We have some people that are a little unreliable.	0
They don't exactly like what I've done to their career.	0
They don't love what I've done, and that's OK. And I don't like what they've done either.	0
But we need to elect five, six, or even seven more senators and I think we can do it.	0
I think we can do it, and we have to start with Patrick Morrisey.	0
He's going to be fantastic.	0
If you vote for Joe Manchin or any other Democrat in November, you're voting for the party that wants to really destroy the coal industry.	0
Patrick said it.	0
Joe endorsed Hillary 100%, and he got along with her even better after she came out with a statement that she wants to destroy coal and coal companies.	0
That's a bad thing.	0
The Democrats want to turn America into one big fat sanctuary city for criminal aliens.	0
And honestly, they're more protective of aliens -- the criminal aliens than they are of the people.	0
They want to take away your Second Amendment.	0
You see what's going on.	0
I don't think you want your Second Amendment played with.	0
They want to take over American health care and abuse our courts to rewrite our constitution.	0
And how do you like the judges that I've been appointing?	0
Justice Kavanaugh, Justice Gorsuch, Supreme Court?	0
There's no worse nightmare for West Virginia this November than Chuck Schumer running the Senate and Nancy Pelosi with Maxine Waters running the House.	0
And that is why you must vote Republican.	0
You gotta get out of the vote.	0
They keep talking about a blue wave.	0
I don't see it.	0
We have the greatest economy we've ever had.	0
Joe Manchin always voted for Obama, and he voted to keep the disaster known as Obamacare.	0
And I will tell you it is being chipped away.	0
We had it beaten, but one man, I'm sure nobody knows who I'm talking about, voted no, shockingly.	0
To -- really surprising to a lot of people because he campaigned on repeal and replace -- but we've really knocked it out, including the individual mandate.	0
We got rid of the most unpopular part of Obamacare, where you have the privilege of paying a fortune for not having to pay a fortune for really bad health care.	0
OK, that's not too good.	0
We got rid of it.	0
A lot of people are very happy about that.	0
That came along with the biggest tax cuts in our history.	0
And Joe Manchin voted no on the tax cuts.	0
The last time I was here, I saw signs along the highway, Joe, you voted no on tax cuts and Joe, you voted no for our president.	0
You voted no.	0
And he's going to vote no.	0
I'm not knocking him, but Schumer's the boss and he may give us a vote on Justice Kavanaugh.	0
He should.	0
Everybody should.	0
I mean, here's a guy -- is this Central Casting?	0
This is what we want.	0
This is a great, brilliant man.	0
But Joe's just not voting with us.	0
He's voting against your tax cuts.	0
He voted against repeal and replace.	0
He votes against the things that we want, and he votes against the people of West Virginia.	0
You can't do that.	0
Joe opposed the wall and he opposed the travel ban.	0
And by the way, the wall right now, that wall is coming along.	1
We're over $3 billion.	0
It's moving along very nicely, very nicely.	0
And if you think it's easy with these people, it's not easy.	0
It's not easy.	0
We're getting the wall built.	0
It's going up and we're getting it built.	1
And we have a big number in right now.	0
[Crowd chants Build That Wall]	0
So Shelley and Cory you hear that, right?	0
Yes.	0
Yes.	0
So we have $3.2 billion.	0
We're looking for $5 billion this year, and all of a sudden it's going to be finished and it's going to be very, very effective.	0
You heard about it today with the illegal alien coming in very sadly from Mexico.	0
And you saw what happened to that incredible, beautiful young woman.	0
Should have never happened.	0
Illegally in our country.	0
We've had a huge impact, but the laws are so bad.	0
The immigration laws are such a disgrace.	0
We're getting them changed, but we have to get more Republicans, we have to get.	0
This election is bigger than any one race.	0
It's about whether we want to continue the amazing progress we've made for America or whether we want to surrender that progress to the forces of extremism and obstruction.	0
Their little phrase that they like, resist, that's all they're good at.	0
They have no policy.	0
They're not good politicians, but they're good at sticking together and resisting.	0
I have almost 400 people that haven't been approved by their slow-walking.	1
Do you know what's slow-walking?	0
They're slow-walking them.	0
We have almost 400 people in our administration, people that gave up their careers that have been waiting over a year to get approved and they're being slow-walked by the Democrats.	0
It's never happened that way in the history of our country and it is a disgrace.	0
It's a disgrace.	0
The Democrat Party is held hostage by the so-called resistance, left-wing haters and angry mobs.	0
They're trying to tear down our institutions, disrespect our flag, demean our law enforcement, denigrate our history, and disparage our great country.	0
And we're not going to let it happen.	0
New York's Democrat Governor Andrew Cuomo even declared that America was never great.	0
Oh, I see, OK. Tell that to our great soldiers at World War I, World War II, Korean War, so many others.	0
Tell them to the folks that sent a rocket up to the moon and our great astronauts.	0
Tell them to all of the great medical research we've done in this country and he says America was never great.	0
I would imagine that's career-threatening, right?	0
I would imagine.	0
How do you get away with that one?	0
Did you hear?	0
He was speaking to a room loaded up with socialists and probably others, probably others.	0
No not communists, but there could have been a couple of them, too.	0
And he made the statement that America was never great and they would go, did you hear?	0
They go, whoa,whoa.	0
They couldn't even believe it.	0
Now that's job-threatening.	0
His comments are an insult to the generations of brave Americans whose blood and sweat and tears built our magnificent country.	0
So this November, you can either vote for the party that says America was never great -- that's going to be their theme now America was never great.	0
Hey, let's do that.	0
They copied mine, Promises Made, Promises Kept.	0
"Let's give them a new theme, ""America Was Never Great."""	0
That's the Democrats' new theme.	0
Can we do that?	0
Yes.	0
We'll retheme their party.	0
Or you can vote proudly for everything that we stand for.	0
We're the greatest country in the world and we are now the greatest economy that we have ever had.	0
We're the greatest economy in the world.	0
[Crowd chants USA]	0
We've gone up $10 trillion in value since my election.	0
We've gone up $10 trillion, think of it, since the election.	0
Was that a great election?	0
Boy.	0
"Remember I was here just before the election and I brought a couple of guys into a room and I said, ""Fellas, supposing we teach you a new skill, supposing we teach you like how to make little widgets or gidgets or gadgets."""	0
These are big, strong coal miners.	0
"They said, ""Sir, we want to dig coal."""	0
"I said, ""I agree with you."""	0
I agree, right?	0
Remember that?	0
Their grandfathers did it.	0
Their fathers did it.	0
That's incredible and it's really happening.	0
We are back.	0
The coal industry is back.	0
So when I came here originally, West Virginia, frankly, was down and out.	0
It was not doing exactly well, one of the last.	0
Do you know that a few months ago, it hit where West Virginia on a per capita basis is one of the most successful GDP states in our union?	0
So we went from being down and out.	0
You're one of the most successful in the union, very close to the top.	0
That is some big change.	0
"And I've had so many people, I was backstage and people are coming up to me, ""Mr. President, thank you, sir, for saving our nation,"" because you understand what that means."	0
We couldn't do anything.	0
Had the other side won, they would have poured on more regulations, raised your taxes.	0
They would have done things that were so bad.	0
You had a very low GDP.	0
It was 1.2%, 1.2%.	0
It was going down.	0
It was going to be a negative.	0
Last quarter, we just hit, as you all know, 4.1%.	0
Nobody thought that was possible.	0
"If -- I always said, if I would have ever said that shortly after winning we're going to hit 4.1%, those people back there would have said, ""This guy, no good, fake news, fake news."""	0
How fake are they?	0
Fake news and the Russian witch hunt?	0
We got a whole big combination.	0
Where is the collusion?	0
You know, they're still looking for collusion.	0
Where is the collusion?	0
Find some collusion.	0
We want to find the collusion.	0
At the beating heart of this election is border security.	0
We have to have that, right?	0
We have to have it.	0
Iowa officials and so many other countries have been reporting numbers where they're having a lot of problems with people coming in.	0
People are coming in, but we're getting them out.	0
We have MS-13 on the run.	0
They poured in here with Obama.	0
We have them on the run because we love the men and women of ICE.	0
A blue wave in November means open borders, which means massive crime.	0
A red wave means safety and strength.	0
That's what it is.	0
The new platform of the Democrat Party is to abolish ICE.	0
A vote for any Democrat in November is a vote to eliminate immigration enforcement, throw open our borders, and set loose vicious predators and violent criminals.	0
They'll be all over our communities.	0
They will be preying on our communities.	0
Yet while many Democrats are calling to abolish ICE, today our brave ICE officers successfully carried out a 14-year-old deportation order against a Nazi criminal who is living in New York, the last known Nazi officer living in the United States.	0
They've been trying to get him out for decades.	0
President Obama tried.	0
They all tried.	0
We got him out, gone.He's gone.	0
He's back in Germany.	0
ICE officers are heroes who uphold our laws and they really do.	0
They uphold our laws and they defend our communities like nobody you've ever seen.	0
And yes, they're tough, they're strong, they're smart, they have great heart, but they go into these communities loaded up with the kind of criminals you don't want to be dealing with.	0
They walk in like it's another day in the office.	0
They're tougher.	0
They're stronger.	0
It's what these other people fear.	0
And by the way, our ICE folks and our border patrol folks, they have no fear.	0
The job they do is incredible.	0
And by the way, while we're at it, law enforcement, these are great, great people and they're doing an incredible job, right?	0
Every single day, ICE is tracking down gang members, drug dealers, predators, and killers, and we're either throwing them in jail or throwing them the hell out of our country.	0
If you want to save ICE, if you want to protect our border and our border patrol, if you want to stop this craziness of sanctuary cities, where criminals are protected -- take a look at Chicago, how about the mayor of Chicago?	0
It's like a war zone.	0
It's a great city.	0
It's like a war zone.	0
This is what those policies do.	0
Last week, 62 people were shot.	0
Twelve died.	0
This is like our country.	0
There's no reason for this.	0
The Republican Party stands proudly with our courageous ICE officers and border patrol agents.	0
And by the way, you know who wants the wall more than any of us?	0
ICE and border patrol because they know that's going to be a big, big factor in stopping the drugs from coming in, the human traffickers, which is worse all over the world than at any time in the history of our world, human traffickers.	0
Who would believe, and it's because of the internet.	0
This election is about security and this election is also about jobs.	0
Wwe have produced.	0
We have produced.	0
Thanks to Republicans, our economy is booming like it has never boomed before.	0
We've created another number that nobody would have believed if I said it during the campaign: 4 million new jobs since the election.	0
Nobody would have believed it.	0
Almost 3.9 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps, think of that.	0
They don't need them because they have a job.	0
They're eating better now.	0
They don't need food stamps, almost 4 million, think of it.	0
Last year in West Virginia, per capita income grew 40% faster than the national average, 40% congratulations.	0
Congratulations.	0
I told you last time I was here, you weren't so happy like you are now.	0
We've added over 400,000 new manufacturing jobs nationwide.	0
That number is soon going to exceed 600,000 and our opponent said there's no such thing as manufacturing jobs anymore, right?	0
"And I'd say, ""Oh I see we're not going to make things any more."""	0
Think of it, we'll be close to 600,000 very soon.	0
We have companies pouring into our country.	0
They're coming back.	0
These are companies that left.	0
They're coming back to Michigan.	0
They're coming back to West Virginia.	0
They're coming back to Pennsylvania and Ohio.	0
They're coming to Florida.	0
They're coming back, not just opening.	0
They're coming back.	0
They left and now they're coming back because they want to be where the action is and the action is in the United States of America.	0
"So the economic growth, as I said, when it hit 4.1%, everybody was like, ""That's amazing,"" except me, because it's going to go much higher than that."	0
When I finish these trade deals -- and the tariffs are very important -- these companies come in and I say to the European Union, very nice people, I say Jean-Claude, we'd like to negotiate a new trade agreement with the European Union.	0
We lost $151 billion over the last number of years per year.	0
Does anyone know what a $151 billion per year is?	0
"And he very respectfully said, ""Mr. President, but we are very happy with the deal."""	0
"I said, ""I'd be happy if I were you too."	0
"I'd be very happy."""	0
I said a second time, a third time, and a fourth time, but they were happy with the deal but we weren't happy because they have barriers up and because they have tariffs, all the things we don't have.	0
You want to build a car and send it to Europe, how many Chevrolets are there in the middle of Berlin?	0
Not too many, maybe one?	0
I doubt it.	0
I don't think you could find the one.	0
"So there are barriers so I said, ""Come on, let's go."""	0
"And then he said, ""No."""	0
"I said, ""Listen."""	0
And I said this to numerous countries, I mean, in all fairness, I don't want to single out anybody, but I said it.	0
Listen, here's what we're going to – it's all about the cars.	0
It's all about the cars, tremendously big industry.	0
We're going to put a 25% tax on every car that comes from the European Union into the United States and that'll take our loss and trade deficit of $151 billion and it'll give us a surplus of $151 billion.	0
That's a fairly dramatic swing and that'll take one little signature, Donald J.	0
Trump.	0
"And I got a call, ""Mr. President, when can we meet?"	0
"We'd like to see you."""	0
And they came, and very respectfully, we're working on a deal.	0
But this is happening all over.	0
Wth China, I have great respect for President Xi, great respect, tremendous respect for China.	0
But they have taken advantage of our country for decades.	0
We have rebuilt China.	0
We have rebuilt China.	0
I used to talk about this.	0
I didn't press it initially because I wanted them to help us with North Korea and they have, and they have, and we're doing well with North Korea.	0
These guys, it's been what three months since I left?	0
"These guys say, ""What's happening with North Korea?"""	0
Hey folks, they've been doing this stuff for 75 years.	0
Three months.	0
What happened?	0
I can tell you and I got along very well with Kim Jong-un.	0
Really well.	0
Good chemistry.	0
Obama was unable to do anything with North Korea and he considered it like -- just read the papers.	0
You'll see what he considered it.	0
So I've been three months.	0
I have a very good relationship with Chairman Kim.	0
We'll see what happens.	0
Who knows?	0
Can I be honest?	0
Who knows?	0
But I haven't taken off the sanctions.	0
We have massive sanctions, but I want to take them off quickly.	0
But they've gotta get rid of the nukes.	0
They've gotta get rid of the nukes.	0
Gotta get rid of them.	0
But who knows what's going to happen?	0
I mean, maybe it'll work out, but I think we've done a good job in a short period of time.	0
You remember it started off extremely hostile.	0
"Remember they said, ""He's going to get us into a war."""	0
They thought my rhetoric was too strong.	0
You remember.	0
I won't say it because I don't want to insult Chairman Kim, but you remember, you remember.	0
Elton John, I don't want to insult-- so I'm not going to mention it.	0
"But the fake news back there said, ""He is going to get us into a war."	0
He's crazy.	0
This guy is crazy.	0
"Our president is crazy."" And then I went to meet the leaders"	0
[ph]	0
and the folks that run NATO, all the leaders of NATO and they weren't paying their bills.	0
They were delinquent.	0
In real estate -- I love real estate -- when somebody doesn't pay their rent, you say – Shelley, you say their delinquent.	0
You gotta pay your rent.	0
And I met him last year and Stoltenberg, secretary general, great guy of NATO.	0
He's my single biggest fan, bigger than any fan I have in the room.	0
You know why?	0
Because nobody was paying their bills.	0
He was in charge of NATO.	0
He couldn't get any money.	0
But last year, I went a year ago, I said you're not paying your bills.	0
You gotta pay your bills.	0
He picked up $44 billion.	0
He told that to the press, they didn't report it.	0
Forty-four billion.	0
And then I just left recently and we're going to pick up at least another close to $100 billion extra.	0
"I said to him, ""You gotta pay your bills."""	0
The United States is paying close to 90% of the cost of protecting Europe, and I think that's wonderful.	1
"I said to Europe -- I said, ""Folks, NATO's better for you than it is for us."	0
"Believe me."""	0
And what happened is they asked a question.	0
They have small countries, big countries, all of these countries were – we're supposed to protect them?	0
"I said, ""Look, it's very simple."	0
You gotta pay up.	0
"You gotta pay your bill."""	0
"And somebody said, ""Sir,"" there's the president of a country calling me sir."	0
That shows respect.	0
"I say, ""Yes, Mr."	0
"President?"""	0
"He said, ""Would you leave us if we don't pay our bills?"""	0
"Now they hated my answer I said, ""Yes, I would have to consider it."	0
"You gotta pay your bill."""	0
They hated the answer.	0
"But if I said, ""No, I won't leave you."	0
You don't have to pay your bills.	0
I won't leave.	0
I promise, will always protect you.	0
You will always be protected.	0
"Don't pay your bills."""	0
Then they're never going to pay their bills.	0
"So I said, ""Yes, I will leave you if you don't pay your bills"" and you could see those checkbooks coming out for billions of dollars."	0
They pay their bills.	0
And I think we'll pick up over the next short while over $100 billion.	0
"And then they said the fake news, they said, ""President Trump treated the NATO nation leaders"" -- in brackets, I put brackets, who have been ripping us off -- treated the NATO leaders with tremendous contempt and disrespect."	0
"And I said, ""No no, no."	0
"They disrespected our country because they weren't paying."""	0
Now they're paying.	0
How about if we got into a conflict because a country was attacked and now we're in World War 3 and we're protecting a country that was attacked and didn't pay its bills?	0
I'd feel so stupid.	0
We're protecting a country that wasn't paying its bills.	0
So I got them to pay $100 billion.	0
It's gonna be much more than that, but tremendous amounts of money, tremendous.	0
They gotta pay up, they're paying up.	0
And then they made the statement that I showed great disrespect.	0
But actually, I have a great relationship with all of those people, 28 people, all of them.	0
We have a great relationship because now they respect us.	0
They respect our country again.	0
They didn't respect our country.	0
They didn't respect our country.	0
They respect us again, and you see it with China.	0
China was walking its way down.	0
I don't want them to go down, but they're down close to 30% in three months.	0
I don't want that.	0
I want them to do well.	0
I want to be their friend.	0
But we had to do things that we had to do.	0
When I came, we were heading in a certain direction that was going to allow China to be bigger than us in a very short period of time.	0
That's not going to happen anymore.	0
Not going to happen anymore.	0
Good luck to them.	0
The long winding road, you know, the long winding road, and I have tremendous respect for China.	0
I mean, the energy, the genius, it's incredible what they've done.	0
And hopefully we're going to have a great relationship, but we can't do it.	0
It's got to be a two-way street.	0
We have only one-way streets, not only China, with everybody.	0
It's a one-way street, our enemies, our friends, our allies.	0
I mean, our allies treat us worse than our enemies.	0
Believe it.	0
So it's all changing.	0
And when we get those trade deals done properly -- and you know what bothers me?	0
"I have people coming to me some people in Congress, ""Sir, can you get this deal done immediately?"""	0
"I say, ""It doesn't work that way."	0
I don't want to go too fast.	0
The deal is not going to be any good if we do that.	0
"We gotta take time, it's got to gestate, right?"""	0
The word gestate, it's like when you're cooking the chicken, time, time, turkey for Thanksgiving.	0
My mother would say, oh eight hours.	0
"I said, ""Eight hours?"""	0
She made the greatest turkey I've ever had, takes time, takes time.	0
"So when they run and they say, ""Oh, can you do NATO right now?"	0
"Could we sign it next week?"""	0
"I said, ""Wait a minute."	0
Look, I like Mexico.	0
I like the new leader.	0
"I think he's going to be terrific, little different than us."""	0
I think I'm doing better with him than with the capitalist.	0
But he knows that Mexico needs the United States.	0
They need the United States.	0
Canada charges us close to 300% tariffs for dairy products going into Canada, which is essentially saying we don't want your dairy products -- this is a wall.	1
They have a wall in a different way.	0
It's called an economic wall.	0
I don't want that.	0
"I'd said, ""Justin, I mean, I don't want to have too much fun with you, Justin."	0
"You can't do that."""	0
Justin Trudeau, nice guy, but they've taken advantage of us for so many years that we have to take our time.	0
But with that being said, we're doing very well.	0
We're on our way with a good deal, a fair deal.	0
I don't want a good deal, I want a fair deal for both of us, fair with Mexico.	0
And you've heard me say it.	0
As an example, when China makes a car, they sell it into the United States.	0
There's 2 1/2 percent tariff, of which they don't pay.	0
So they paid nothing.	0
Other than that, it's a wonderful deal.	0
When we make a car, we sell it into China, and there's a 25% tariff.	1
And that's just the beginning, here's others.	0
A man was driving down a street in China and he looked over and it was a Chevrolet, like Camaro, does that make sense?	0
Is it a Camaro?	0
I think it costs $39,000 or $40,000.	0
He's in China.	0
"He's in Beijing and he shouts across -- they're stopped -- he then shouts across, ""Tell me, how much did that car cost in China?"""	0
"Guy looks, ""$119,000."""	0
Now you understand that, right?	0
It's all taxes and taxes and taxes.	0
We can't do that anymore.	0
Can't do it.	0
We are a country with unbelievable potential.	0
We are a country that has been ripped off by everybody, and we're not going to be ripped off anymore.	0
And if it takes me a little angst to tell senators and congressmen and all of the people that really do have your heart in the hands, in many cases -- sometimes I wonder where they're coming from with these suggestions -- but it's going to have to take that little period of time.	0
With that being said, we're moving so fast, nobody could even believe it.	0
And every country wants to make a deal because we're like the big fat piggybank that everybody wants to rob, and we're not going to let them rob us anymore.	0
Is that OK, West Virginia?	0
We're not going to let them rob us anymore.	0
Every day we're keeping our promises.	0
We're canceling Obama's illegal anti-coal destroying regulations, the so-called Clean Power Plan.	0
Doesn't that sound nice?	0
Clean power.	0
You know, when I ended the Paris accord, what's a more beautiful name than the Paris accord?	0
Let's call it the West Virginia accord -- maybe I would have signed it.	0
But when I entered it, that was going to cost us hundreds of billions of dollars, hundreds of billions.	0
And other countries, as an example, China didn't kick in until many years in the future.	0
We kicked in immediately.	0
Russia went back many years, which was not a clean time in terms of the environment because you know what?	0
We all agree, we want a clean environment.	0
We want a strong, beautiful, clean environment.	0
I want clean air.	0
I want crystal clean water, and we've got it.	0
We've got the cleanest country in the planet right now.	0
There's nobody cleaner than us and it's getting better and better.	0
But I'm getting rid of some of these ridiculous rules and regulations, which are killing our companies, our states, and our jobs.	0
Just today, we announced our new affordable clean energy proposal that will help our coal-fired power plants and save consumers, you, me, everybody, billions and billions of dollars.	0
We've eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations, and Republicans have passed the biggest tax cuts and reform.	0
The reform is very important.	0
But you know what I've said, I don't want to talk about reform because nobody knows what it means.	0
That could be a tax increase.	0
"I said, ""How come it's been Ronald Reagan since you got the last big tax cut?"""	0
"And they looked at me and said, ""We don't know."""	0
And a lot of the great senators and the congressmen came up to see me and they had the 2018 tax reform.	0
"I said, ""What the hell does that mean?"	0
"Are you going to raise taxes?"""	0
Then I found out this is what they've done for 40 years, tax reform.	0
"I said, ""Nobody knows what it means."""	0
And we do have reform in there, great reform.	0
"But they said nobody knows -- I said, ""Nobody knows what it means."	0
Here it is.	0
"I want to put it down, tax cuts."""	0
"They said, ""What would be your favorite name Mr."	0
"President?"""	0
"I said, ""The tax cut, cut, cut, cut bill."""	0
And we almost did it.	0
We almost did it but in all fairness in this case congressmen, a couple of them thought it was a little bit tacky.	0
So we call it the Tax Cut and Jobs Bill.	0
But you know what?	0
We have done great reform.	0
But it's the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, and you people are benefiting by it.	0
You're benefiting.	0
And companies are benefiting, and those companies are the ones that are providing all of the jobs.	0
We're setting records on jobs.	0
We're protecting, also so important for West Virginia and a lot of states, we are protecting again religious liberty and we're also standing up to social media censorship.	0
That's the new thing.	0
That's the new thing.	0
I'd rather have fake news like CNN.	0
I would rather have fake news – it's true -- than have anybody, including liberals, socialists, anything, than have anybody stopped and censored.	0
You gotta live -- we gotta live with it.	0
We gotta get used to it.	0
We're going to live with fake news.	0
There's too many sources.Every one of us is sort of like a newspaper.	0
You have Twitter, you have whatever you have, Facebook, but everyone, you can't have censorship.	0
"You can't pick one person and say, ""Well, we don't like what he's been saying."	0
"He's out."""	0
So we'll live with fake news.	0
I mean, I hate to say it, but we have no choice because that's by far the better alternative.	0
We can't have people saying censorship because you know what?	0
It can turn it around.	0
It can be them next.	0
It can be them next.	0
We believe in the right of Americans to speak their minds.	0
We repeal the core of Obamacare.	0
I told you, individual mandate -- because we want to give critically ill patients.	0
We have to give them access.	0
We have to give health care to people.	0
We want the right to try.	0
Do you know what the right to try is?	0
They've been trying to get this for 40 years.	0
They couldn't get it.	0
A person is terminally ill, they're terminally ill.	0
They're really sick.	0
And I know people, if they have money, they travel all over the world to try and find a cure.	0
If they don't have money, they die.	0
They die.	0
We have the greatest scientists in the world, that's why China and so many other people, they're trying to -- countries they're trying to steal our technology.	0
We can't let them happen.	0
But we have so many people that want to be able to give -- it's like hope, right to try.	0
I love the name.	0
It's a right to try.	0
They never had it before.	0
So a person is terminally ill and we have a great new drug, but it's going to take another two, three years to have it approved.	0
OK, maybe longer.	0
But the tests are really looking good.	0
And this person is very sick.	0
And this person is going to be dead in 90 days and we couldn't get that drug for that person no matter who you were.	0
"And I said, ""Wait a minute what's the story with this?"""	0
Now, there were a lot of complications because the insurance companies had problems, the medical companies had – everybody.	0
A lot of people didn't want them in the stats, horrible things.	0
"But I said, ""Well, what's going on?"	0
We're going to take the right to try and we went through with the help of Cory, with the help of your great, wonderful -- you are a coal lover, aren't you, huh, Shelley?	0
But with the help of Shelley, soon to be with the help of Patrick Patrick, Patrick, oh, he's going to get a lot of things.He's going to get it.	0
We got it approved.	0
So now if we have a great drug that hasn't been approved and somebody has a certain illness they're going to be able to be -- to try.	0
And you know what?	0
Some of the drugs we have in the pipeline are amazing.	0
It's going to work for a lot of people and it's going to give them hope.	0
It's going to give them hope, big deal.	0
We've just secured $6 billion to fight the opioid epidemic.	0
And I know in West Virginia, that's a big deal, right?	0
That's a big deal.We confirmed a record number of Circuit Court judges, it's a record and it's going bigger and bigger.	0
We have a lot of them in the line if Schumer would ever get them approved.	0
He's not exactly thrilled about approving them, that I can tell you.	0
We confirmed the great deal Gorsuch to the Supreme Court of the United States.	0
And as I just said, Justice Kavanagh is doing great.	0
Looks like I had a very tough Central Casting.	0
How do you vote against him?	0
But the Democrats may find a way.	0
We've secured a record $700 billion for our military this year and $716 billion for next year, billion with a b.	0
Our military will be stronger and bigger and better and more sophisticated than it's ever been, ever.	0
And hopefully we'll never have to use it.	0
You don't get a lot of good fighters out here.	0
I see some of them.	0
I know some of them.	0
And the one thing about a fighter or a nation or whatever you want, the stronger your military, the better chance you have of never having to use it.	0
We don't want to use it.	0
We don't want to use it.	0
And all of that equipment is being built right here in the U.S.A. We make the greatest fighter jets in the world.We make the greatest ships in the world.	0
We make the greatest missiles and rockets.	0
Nobody does it like us.	0
And in my direction, The Pentagon is working hard to create the sixth branch of the American Armed Forces, the space force.That's very exciting.	0
We need it.	0
That's the new frontier, and I'm not just talking about sending rockets to the Moon.	0
I'm talking about militarily.That's where it's at.	0
Thanks to the leadership of U.N.	0
Ambassador Nikki Haley.	0
We've reduced the United Nations spending by $1.3 billion saving U.S. taxpayers $350 million.	0
Just came out, but nobody wants to ride it.	0
"We just passed the landmark VA accountability law.That's where people that don't treat our vets properly, we look at them and we say, ""You're fired."	0
"Get the hell out."""	0
45 years they have been trying to pass it.	0
45 years they've tried the pass it.	0
We also passed veterans choice so that if our veterans can't get the care they need, they have the right to see a private doctor.	0
They don't have to wait in line for three weeks, four weeks, eight weeks, two months.	0
I withdrew the United States from the horrible Iran nuclear deal.	0
And this month, we reimposed tough sanctions on Iran's nuclear program and on Iran.	0
I also recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.	0
And I understand now what happened because every president – many, many presidents.	0
"They said, ""We're going to do it."	0
We're going to move our embassy to Jerusalem.	0
"It's going to be the capital of Israel, and we're going to do it."""	0
We're going do it, and then they don't do it.	0
[Inaudible]	0
Politicians, they don't do it.	0
So I said, I'm going do it during the campaign.I said it right here in West Virginia.	0
And I now understand why many, many presidents before me said they were going to do it and didn't do it because I was inundated with calls from foreign leaders, every country.	0
Don't do it.	0
Don't do it.	0
Don't do it.	0
Please don't do it, don't do it.	0
And so actually, what I did, I was about five days off.I stopped taking calls.	0
"I said, ""I'll call you back next week,"" because I knew what they were going to ask me."	0
It's much easier if it was, oopsie, I didn't know you're always calling for that reason.	0
So I approved it, and it should have been done years ago.	0
And if there's ever going to be peace, remember I said it, with the Palestinians, it was a good thing to have done because we took it off the table.	0
Because every time they were peace talks, they never got past Jerusalem becoming the capital.	0
So I said, let's take it off the table.	0
And you know what, in the negotiation, Israel will have to pay a higher price because they want a very big thing, but I took it off the table.	0
They could never get by.You understand that Cory.	0
You both understand that.	0
Shelley?	0
They could never get past the fact of Jerusalem becoming the capital.	0
Now it's off the table.	0
There's nothing to negotiate.	0
But they'll get something very good because it's their turn next.	0
Let's see what happens.	0
It's very – I've always heard that's the toughest deal of all deals that's called peace between Israel and the Palestinians.	0
They say that's the toughest of all deals.	0
Let's see what happens.	0
Instead of apologize, that's -- what we're doing is we're winning.	0
Instead of apologizing from that, we're standing up for America and we're standing up for the heroes who defend our country, but to continue this incredible success, we must elect more Republicans.We must elect Patrick Morrisey.	0
We need him.	0
We need Patrick.	0
So get your friends, your neighbors, your co-workers, your family members, get the people that love our country and get out to vote.	0
We need his vote so badly.	0
We need his energy.	0
You're going to see this guy has energy.	0
Loyal citizens like you helped to build this country.	0
Together we're taking back our country, returning power to where it belongs, to the American people.	0
From Morgantown to Madison to Charleston, this great state was settled by tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women who tamed the wilderness to build a better life for themselves and for their incredible American families.	0
They didn't have a lot of money.	0
They didn't have a lot of luxury, but they had grit and they had faith and they loved each other.	0
And I'll tell you what, they were smart.	0
They are smart.	0
We're the smart ones, remember.	0
I say it all the time.You hear the elite.	0
They're not elite, we're elite.	0
You're smarter than they are, you have more money than they are, you have better jobs than they do, you'rethe elite.	0
So let them have the word elite.	0
You're the super elite.That's what it is.	0
I always hate -- I always hate when they say, well the elite decided not to go to something I'm doing, right, the elite.	0
"I said, ""Well, I have a lot more money than they do."	0
I have a much better education than they have.I'm smarter than they are.	0
I have many much more beautiful homes than they do.	0
I have a better apartment at the top of Fifth Avenue.	0
Why the hell are they the elite?	0
Tell me.	0
Because you are the elite.	0
Just remember that.	0
You are the elite.	0
They're not the elite.	0
That's just a name.	0
Aren't you insulted when they say the elite?	0
To me, I'm insulted, always insulted.	0
They're the elite, they're not the elite.	0
Your people and the people that preceded you in West Virginia were the Carpenters and the coal miners, the ministers, the metal workers, the farmers, the factory workers, but they all had one thing in common.	0
They love their families, they love their country, and they love their God.	0
We stand on the shoulders of generations of American patriots who knew how to fight and they knew how to win.	0
We're winning again.	0
We're winning again.	0
Just like them we're going to keep on fighting and we're going to keep on winning and we're going to win for our nation, our children, our families and we're going to win for our continued freedom.	0
I joke that I'll have Patrick Morriseycoming to me soon.	0
"He'll be your senator and he'll say, ""Mr. President, the people of West Virginia can't stand winning so much."	0
"They haven't won in decades and now you're winning with coal, you're winning with everything."""	0
"He's going say – Patrick, he's going to say, ""Mr. President, please they don't want to win so much."	0
They can't stand it.	0
Please you're winning too much for West Virginia.	0
"Please stop winning."""	0
"And I'm going to say, ""Patrick."	0
I'm sorry.	0
I don't care what the hell the people of West Virginia want.	0
"We're going to keep on winning anyway, because I believe that's what they want."""	0
Right?	0
That's what they want because the people of West Virginia never give up.	0
They never given and they never back down because we are Americans and our hearts bleed red, white and blue.	0
We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.	0
And together we will make America wealthy again.	0
That's happening.	0
That's happening a lot faster than the fake news ever said it could happen.	0
We will make America strong again.	0
We will make America safe again and we will make America great again.	0
Thank you, West Virginia.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, Mike.	0
Good morning.	0
Hello, Ivanka.	0
I know you know a few of the people in this room.	0
I do.	0
I do.	0
All the killers from New York -- I'm looking at all those competitive -- those great, great talents, great builders.	0
I have to give you a heads-up that Ivanka chaired one of the sessions before this -- tough act to follow.	0
Oh, she's tough.	0
Very tough.	0
Vice President Pence listed some of the amazing accomplishments that have taken place since your election and your 75 days in office.	0
The stock market has had almost unprecedented sustained growth, unprecedented confidence from our manufacturing sector and other business sectors, leading to massive private sector investment in job growth.	0
You have gotten rid of regulations that were unnecessary and were job-stifling.	0
You have strengthened our borders and strengthened our military.	0
You've nominated a great -- superb Supreme Court justice, amongst many other things.	0
How does all that feel?	0
And we're getting unbelievable credit for what we've done, other than the mainstream media, which just gives us no credit whatsoever.	0
But we are getting tremendous credit.	0
And if you look at the real estate industry, the mining industry, the farming industry -- if you look at any of the major industries you see what's going.	0
In fact, even today I was very happy as I read this morning early that our trade deficit with others has gone down very considerably in the last short period of time.	0
It's having a big impact.	0
And, as you know, I'm meeting with the President of China on Thursday and Friday in Palm Beach, Florida, and I think we're going to have a very interesting talk.	0
We're having -- have a lot of respect for him.	0
I've spoken to him numerous times.	0
But we have to do better, because our deficit with China, as you know, $504 billion.	0
That's a year.	0
That's enough for a lifetime.	0
Even Steve would say that.	0
But that's a year.	0
So we're going to have a great meeting, I'm sure we're going to have a fantastic meeting.	0
And we're going to talk about a lot of things, including, of course, North Korea, a problem.	0
And that's really a humanity problem.	0
So we're going to be talking about that also.	0
You have made it a driving force in this administration to bring in the best minds we can from the private sector, to listen intently to them and to take decisive action.	0
How important is that, and how important is it to reform government to bridge the gap between the private and public sectors?	0
Well, I did, I brought you, I brought Gary Cohn, I brought a lot of very great people -- my friend, Steve, is helping us out.	0
We have a superstar committee of 22 people.	0
And every time somebody calls me I say, Steve, put them on -- no, we want to keep it at this level.	0
The heads of the biggest companies, they all want to be on our committee, right, Stephen?	0
But Steve likes to keep it very small.	0
But they will go off and they'll disappear and we'll put others on.	0
But we've had some great meetings and we've all learned a lot.	0
One thing that did come up, and it came up yesterday, was Gary Cohn -- where's Gary?	0
Is he here?	0
Could you bring that chart, please?	0
Do you mind?	0
Let me see that chart.	0
So this was just something -- this is sort of incredible.	0
That's so beautiful.	0
Yeah, no, you're not quite -- this is to build a highway in the United States -- now, this was just done yesterday.	0
I saw it for the first time.	0
I said, I'm speaking to some of my friends who are builders, really great builders, and they've gone through the process -- we've all gone through it in New York -- we call it the zoning process in New York.	0
But you start up here and this is anywhere from a 10 to 20-year process.	0
You have -- is it 17 agencies.	0
You have hundreds and hundreds of permits.	0
Many of them are statutory, where you can't even apply for the second permit until six months go by.	0
So this is to build a highway.	0
This is a simple highway.	0
And these are the agencies -- so it's 17 agencies.	0
How many different steps is it?	0
Sixteen different approvals.	0
Sixteen.	0
Twenty-nine different statutes.	0
Five different executive orders that all apply to this process.	0
This is indicative, so this is not a specific project, but this is the type of process that a government -- this is a state government -- would have to go through to permit a highway federally.	0
This is just federal, not state regulations.	0
So it can take anywhere from 10 -- if you're really good, 10 years to 20 years.	0
And then they vote, and you lose.	0
They don't want it.	0
[Laughter]	0
And it costs sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars just to go through the process.	0
Thank you very much.	0
That was a great job you did.	0
Be careful, don't fall.	0
I don't want to have you fall.	0
You'll be a big story in the paper if you go down.	0
[Laughter]	0
So I just saw that yesterday.	0
Gary Cohn walked in and he showed it to me, and -- for no reason.	0
I said, you have to do me a favor.	0
But a lot of you, you're such pros, some of the best pros in the world sitting in this room, you understand it.	0
It's a process.	0
Now, I've always liked it because it gave people that could go through that process an advantage, like Jerry, but it gave us an advantage if you could get through the process.	0
But getting a building approved in New York is a horrible, horrible thing.	0
And that's nothing compared to when you get into the highways and the dams -- they don't even talk about dams anymore.	0
Hydropower is a great, great, form of power -- we don't even talk about it, because to get the environmental permits are virtually impossible.	0
It's one of the best things you can do -- hydro.	0
But we don't talk about it anymore.	0
So we've come to a halt.	0
We have a tremendous person that we put in charge of EPA, Scott Pruitt, who is an environmental person.	0
He wants clean air, he wants clean water, but he doesn't thing it takes you 26 years to get a permit to build a building and to have jobs, at which time those companies are usually gone, out of business, et cetera.	0
So we're really speeding up the process.	0
We're going to try and take that process from a minimum of 10 years down to one year.	0
I said can't we make it four months?	0
Can't we do it in four months?	0
And there is a certain logic to that, but we'll be satisfied with the year -- but it won't be any more than a year.	0
So we have to build roads.	0
We have to build highways.	0
We're talking about a very major infrastructure bill of a trillion dollars -- perhaps even more.	0
And when we have to do -- our jobs -- I mean, if we say, we're giving to New York City hundreds of millions of dollars to build a road someplace, it doesn't help if they can't start because it's going to take seven and a half years to get the permits.	0
Even to redo a road takes years to get the permits.	0
You know, you have a road that's there and you want to redo it, and you have to get new permits for the kind of asphalt you're using, the kind of concrete you may want to use.	0
And if we're going to give all of this money -- you know, there was very large infrastructure bill that was approved during the Obama administration -- a trillion dollars -- nobody ever saw anything being built.	1
I mean, to this day, I haven't heard of anything that's been built.	0
They used most of that money -- it went, and they used it on social programs.	1
And we want this to be on infrastructure.	0
I'm working with Steve Roth and with Richard LeFrak -- two friends of mine that are very good builders.	0
They're great builders.	0
And they know to get things done.	0
They know how to cut red tape.	0
We're going to give them the advantage of having what we have.	0
I see Elaine is here, so important, who is doing an incredible job, by the way -- Secretary of Transportation.	0
And Elaine will be working.	0
But we're going to set up a committee headed by Steve and Richard, and we're going to cut a lot of red tape.	0
But we don't want to send a billion dollars to New York and find out, five years later, the money was never spent, because we're going to be very strong that it has to be spent on shovels, not on other programs.	0
And in the last case, a lot of it was spent on other programs.	0
But we're going to say, if you don't spend the money -- if you don't start -- if you have a job that you can't start within 90 days, we're not going to give you the money for it.	0
Because it doesn't help -- doesn't help us.	0
And we're going to be very strong on that.	0
They have to be able to start within 90 days.	0
Mr. President, we have some of the great business leaders in the country here.	0
If okay with you, they have a few questions, if that's --	0
Sure.	0
Great.	0
Hello, Jerry.	0
[Laughter]	0
Hi, Mr. President.	0
[Laughter]	0
He didn't have to say his name.	0
He was ready to say his name -- we know.	0
Jerry Speyer, everybody.	0
Mr. President, you're doing a great job, and we're all really grateful to you for the sacrifices you're making.	0
Hope you heard that.	0
That sounds much better.	0
I think from New York's point of view we send a lot of money into the economy.	0
As a number of people have said, it's over a trillion dollars.	0
We're worried we're going to have a problem with Congress.	0
With the deductions, right?	0
Well, that, too.	0
That, too.	0
But we're worried about various programs that help the city.	0
The city is doing fine right now -- even the Yankees are doing fine.	0
But what we're really concerned about is the future.	0
Do you have any advice for us?	0
Look, I love New York.	0
And in some ways we're all lucky that I'm from New York,, because New York has unique problems.	0
So does Los Angeles, so does Chicago.	0
There are places that have unique problems.	0
One of the problems that you have is debt and deductibility.	0
That's a big one, because a lot of the states that don't have debt or have very little debt -- like in the case of Mike Pence, where he did such a good job in Indiana, and it's a AAA-rated bond, one of the strongest in the country, and deductibility is not that big of a deal because they don't have that much to deduct.	0
And over here, in New York, when you look at what's going on with us, we don't know in terms of the municipality and in terms of the state, we don't know if it can even make it if you don't have that.	0
Are people going to buy?	0
So it's a very big problem.	0
And the problem I have is that there are many places throughout the country that are in the exact opposite position.	0
And they consider that a gift to the state and a gift to the people.	0
And we know New York does things that a lot of people don't read about.	0
You look at what -- the money they contribute to our economy, to our country, and people don't know about that.	0
They don't maybe want to know about that.	0
So you do have -- I call it a tale of two cities.	0
You have different interests.	0
But I am watching over everybody, Jerry.	0
You're in good hands, okay?	0
You're in good hands, believe me.	0
You can tell the people of New York.	0
Even though I didn't win New York State.	0
I should have won New York State, but I didn't.	0
[Applause, Laughter]	0
Mr. President, Cathy Engelbert with Deloitte.	0
I want to return to a conversation we just had with Ivanka, Dina and Wilbur on jobs, the workforce of the future.	0
And so as we think about that and we think about our skillsets, in New York City alone our high school -- public high school graduation rate is at 70 percent, but the readiness of our students for college and careers is only 37 -- it's assessed at 37 percent.	0
So as we look at the pace of change, we look at the digital transformation we all see in business and the marketplace, and we look at the skills that -- this disconnect between what employers need and what our students coming into our workforces are prepared to deliver.	0
It would be great to get your thoughts on the priorities of the administration around education, around, again, what I like to call not the future of work but the work of the future.	0
Because the future of work sounds a little ominous, but the work of the future actually sounds pretty visionary.	0
So if you could give us those priorities --	0
Okay, so before you sit, so you're giving me numbers from New York.	0
You're a proud New Yorker, but you're giving me numbers -- why is it doing so badly?	0
Tell me.	0
Why are the numbers so horrific in terms of education?	0
And what happens when somebody goes through school and then they can't read after -- they graduate from high school and they can barely read.	0
So what's the answer?	0
Yes.	0
So, first, I would say that as we look at New York, New York has made enormous progress in a decade.	0
By the way, that 70 percent was 50 percent, so a 40 percent increase.	0
So we're making enormous progress in making an impact on --	0
See how quickly she's changing?	0
See that?	0
[Laughter]	0
Making enormous progress, but we're not done.	0
We have a lot of work to do.	0
And I think -- we talked earlier about public/private partnerships, apprenticeship models, which -- we have a beautiful apprenticeship model that works and brings them our next generation of leaders.	0
So I do think there's a lot we can do through relooking at funding programs.	0
We talked earlier about consolidating the many programs that are out there.	0
We're all trying to make our individual impact and we can make a huge impact together.	0
Sure.	0
I know you work very hard on it and you have made progress.	0
Charter schools are another thing that people are talking about a lot, and some of the charter schools in New York have been amazing.	0
They've done incredibly well.	0
People can't get in.	0
I mean, you can't get in.	0
I don't call it an experiment anymore, it's far beyond an experiment.	0
If you look at so many elements of education, and it's so sad to see what's coming -- what's happening in the country.	0
Even the numbers, as good -- you say we're doing better, but the numbers in New York, the numbers in Chicago are very rough.	0
The numbers in Los Angeles, the cities, it's a very rough situation.	0
Common Core -- I mean, we have to bring education more local.	0
We can't be managing education from Washington.	0
When I go out to Iowa, when I go out to the different states and I talk, they want to run their school programs locally, and they'll do a much better job than somebody -- and look, these are some very good people in Washington, but you also have bureaucrats that make a lot of money and don't really care that much about what they're doing or about the community that they have never seen and they'll never meet, and they never will see.	0
And I like the fact of getting rid of -- Common Core to me is -- we have to end it.	0
We have to bring education local.	0
To me, I've always said it, I've been saying it during the campaign.	0
And we're doing it.	0
Betsy DeVos is -- she's doing a terrific job, highly respected, tremendous track record.	0
But she's got one of the toughest jobs of any of our secretaries, to me.	0
She's got one of the toughest jobs.	0
There's some pretty tough jobs out there, but she's got one of the toughest jobs.	0
We're going to spend a lot of money and a lot of expertise.	0
We're going to have great talent having to do with education, because there's nothing more important than education.	0
And we've got to get those numbers in New York better, and I think they will be better.	0
"And a lot of people -- a lot of the greatest people I know in New York, they're totally involved, including Ivanka and Jared, they're so much involved, and it's so important to them, the word ""education."""	0
And it's happening, and I see it happening in New York very much.	0
But it's happening elsewhere, too.	0
I think we're going to have a great four years.	0
Mr. President, I know you have --	0
Prior to running again.	0
-- a pressing issue to deal with.	0
Steve and Mike I think just wanted to thank you for attending today, and maybe make a final comment on behalf of --	0
Well, thanks a lot for being here.	0
And thanks for everybody for being here.	0
It's been a really interesting day, and you've had everybody of importance at the event.	0
I think it's terrific in terms of the stuff you're trying to do to modernize the government, educate, and so forth.	0
And I think we have to keep a focus on that, because the outside world doesn't always get the message that that's really what's going on -- because you're doing profound things, taking on enormous embedded issues.	0
And I think with the kind of effort that can be marshaled, you can do amazing things.	0
And that's on behalf of Mike Corbat and myself who chaired the Partnership -- it's sort of trust, and gets rotated from person to person every two years.	0
I want to wish you really good luck with the Chinese.	0
That's an important thing, as we all know.	0
And I think there's a real opportunity to make progress with them.	0
And you should have a good time in Florida.	0
I hope the weather is good.	0
Yeah, the weather will be beautiful.	0
Thank you, Steve.	0
I just want to finish by saying that we are absolutely destroying these horrible regulations that have been placed on your heads over not eight years, over the last 20 and 25 years.	0
You have regulations that are horrendous.	0
Dodd-Frank is an example of what we're working on, and we're working on it right now.	0
We're going to be coming out with some very strong -- far beyond recommendations -- we're going to be doing things that are going to be very good for the banking industry so that the banks can loan money to people that need it.	0
I speak to people all the time.	0
"They used to borrow money from banks to open up -- there's one in Nevada -- to open up a pizza shop here, three shops -- he had a bank, and he said, you know -- at that time he called me ""Mr. Trump"" because I hadn't won yet -- but he said, ""Mr. Trump, I can't open up anything; I can't do anything."	0
The banks don't even -- I had a bank for 20 years; now they don't even take my phone call.	0
And I was always a very good customer.	0
"So I haven't been able to do what I do."""	0
They can't do it.	0
I mean, the banks got so restricted.	0
And I've always said -- and some people get insulted -- but, you know, it's not necessarily the man that's making a lot of money that's running the bank.	0
You look at the folks from government that are running all over the banks, they're running the banks.	0
And the people that are really the head people, they're petrified of the regulators.	0
They're petrified.	0
They can't move.	0
The regulators are running the banks.	0
So we're going to do a very major haircut on Dodd-Frank.	0
We want strong restrictions, we want strong regulation, but not regulation that makes it impossible for the banks to loan to people that are going to create jobs.	0
But we're doing -- that's just one example.	0
We're doing so many cuts on regulations.	0
And we have a book on regulations, and if you add them all up, it goes up to the ceiling three times over.	0
It's just one after another after another.	0
It's just like that chart.	0
I thought that chart was so descriptive.	0
And every industry is just like that chart, and that's to build a simple roadway or highway that's what you have to go through.	0
And we're going to be able to get rid of 90, 95 percent of that and still have the same kind of protection.	0
And we want safety and we want environmental -- we want environmental protection.	0
I've won awards on environmental protection.	0
I'm a big believer, believe it or not.	0
But we want that kind of protection.	0
We want clean air and we want clean water, but we shouldn't have to get the approvals from 16 different agencies for almost the same thing.	0
So we have a country with tremendous potential.	0
We have the greatest people on Earth, but we have to use that potential and we have to let those people do their thing.	0
And with that, I just want to thank you all.	0
I think you're going to see a very much different environment than you've been used to over the last, again, 20, 25 years.	0
We're going to unleash the country.	0
And I'm willing to take the heat, and that's okay.	0
I've been taking the heat my whole life.	0
But in the end, I know it's the right thing to do.	0
And we're going to create a lot of jobs.	0
We have 100 million people, if you look -- the real number is not 4.6 percent.	0
They told me I had 4.6 percent last month, I'm doing great.	0
I said, yeah, but what about the 100 million people.	0
A lot of those people came out and voted for me.	0
I call them the forgotten man, the forgotten woman.	0
But a lot of those people, a good percentage of them, would like to have jobs, and they don't.	0
One of the statistics that to me is just ridiculous -- so the 4.6 sounds good, but when you look for a job, you can't find it and you give up -- you are now considered statistically employed.	1
But I don't consider those people employed.	0
If you look at what's happened with Ford and with General Motors and with Fiat-Chrysler and so many other car companies, you see what they're doing back in Michigan and Ohio -- they were leaving.	0
They were going to Mexico and many other places.	0
They're now staying here.	0
Now, I did say -- Reed knows this very well, because you've seen me say it many times to the big auto companies at meetings -- it's okay, enjoy your new plant; please send me a picture, I'm sure it's going to be lovely.	0
But when you make your car or when you make your air conditioner, and you think you're going to fire all of our workers and open up a new place in another country, and you're going to come through what will be a very strong border, which is already -- you see what's happened; 61 percent down now in terms of illegal people coming in.	1
Way, way down in terms of drugs pouring into our country and poisoning our youth.	0
Way down.	0
General Kelly has done a great job.	0
But when you think you're going to sell that car or that air conditioner through our border, it's not going to happen.	0
You're going to have a tax.	0
And the tax may be 35 percent.	0
And you know what, every single major company that I've had that conversation with has said, you know, we've decided to stay in the United States.	0
It's amazing.	0
And you would have thought they would have said this, frankly, for years.	0
But nobody has ever said it.	0
And we've lost close to 70,000 factories over a relatively short period of time -- 70,000.	1
You wouldn't believe it's possible, Reed, to lose 70,000 factories -- 70,000.	1
You know, you look at a map of the United States -- how many factories can you lose?	0
We lost almost 70,000 factories.	1
And I will tell you, that's not happening, because now they're staying here and they're all expanding here.	0
Ford announced last week a massive expansion of three of its plants.	0
That was not going to happen, believe me, if I didn't win.	0
So, good luck, everybody.	0
Enjoy yourselves.	0
You're my friends.	0
You're amazing people.	0
And we're going to put you to work.	0
Thank you.	0
[Applause]	0
Good evening, everyone, from the Carrier Intrepid here in New York City.	0
In just a couple of short months, Americans are going to vote in a critical election.	0
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are vying not only to become president of the United States, but one of them will become the leader of the most potent military force the world has ever seen.	0
I’m standing in a place where I can actually see the site of the World Trade Center.	0
Fifteen years ago this week, the worst terror attack on American soil changed the world and launched this nation into years of war.	0
Tonight’s forum is a great opportunity for these nominees to talk about national security and the complex global issues that face our nation.	0
And they’ll get to tell you why they are ready for the role of commander-in-chief.	0
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)	0
It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba as an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States.	0
I have today ordered to Vietnam the Air Mobile Division.	0
Air and naval forces of the United States launched a series of strikes against the headquarters and military assets that support Moammar Gadhafi.	0
No president can easily commit our sons and daughters to war.	0
We can and will succeed because our mission is clear and our troops are strong.	0
I can hear you.	0
The rest of the world hears you.	0
And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.	0
I can report to the American people the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaida.	0
(END VIDEO CLIP)	0
The Commander-in-Chief Forum, live from the Carrier Intrepid in New York.	0
Here now is Matt Lauer.	0
Good evening, everyone.	0
The decisions a commander-in- chief makes can have a profound and lasting impact on all Americans, but none more so than the brave men and women who serve, fight, and die for our country.	0
What makes tonight’s forum unique, some of the questions will be asked by U.S. military veterans who are in our audience.	0
The presidential nominees will appear back-to-back tonight.	0
After a coin toss yesterday won by Mr. Trump, he chose to go second.	0
So that means we begin tonight with the Democratic nominee for president.	0
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Hillary Clinton.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Matt, how are you?	0
Good to see you.	0
Thank you.	0
Hi.	0
How are you?	0
Good to have you.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Nice to see you.	0
Good evening.	0
Thank you very much.	0
I’m happy you’re doing this.	0
Let me — thank you very much, I’m happy to be here.	0
Let me ask you something ahead of time that I’ll ask Mr. Trump in a half an hour.	0
To the best of your ability tonight, can we talk about your qualities and your qualifications to be commander-in-chief and not use this as an opportunity to attack Mr. Trump, all right?	0
And I’ll ask him the exact same thing.	0
I think that’s an exactly right way to proceed.	0
OK.	0
This is a very important decision for our country.	0
And each of us should be presenting our experience, our expertise, and our plans to protect and defend the United States and our allies around the world.	0
What is the most important characteristic that a commander-in-chief can possess?	0
Steadiness.	0
An absolute rock steadiness, and mixed with strength to be able to make the hard decisions.	0
Because I’ve had the unique experience of watching and working with several presidents.	0
And these are not easy decisions.	0
If they were, they wouldn’t get to the president in the first place.	0
And when you’re sitting in the Situation Room, as I have on numerous occasions, particularly with respect to determining whether to recommend the raid against bin Laden, what you want in a president, a commander-in-chief, is someone who listens, who evaluates what is being told to him or her, who is able to sort out the very difficult options being presented…	0
You’re talking about judgment.	0
… and then makes the decision.	0
Makes the decision, that’s right.	0
So judgment is a key.	0
Temperament and judgment, yes.	0
The word “judgment” has been used a lot around you, Secretary Clinton, over the last year-and-a-half, and in particular concerning your use of your personal e-mail and server to communicate while you were secretary of state.	0
You’ve said it’s a mistake.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
You said you made not the best choice.	0
You were communicating on highly sensitive topics.	0
Why wasn’t it more than a mistake?	0
Why wasn’t it disqualifying, if you want to be commander-in- chief?	0
Well, Matt, first of all, as I have said repeatedly, it was a mistake to have a personal account.	0
I would certainly not do it again.	0
I make no excuses for it.	0
It was something that should not have been done.	0
But the real question is the handling of classified material, which is I think what the implication of your question was.	0
And for all the viewers watching you tonight, I have a lot of experience dealing with classified material, starting when I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee going into the four years as secretary of state.	0
Classified material has a header which says “top secret,” “secret,” “confidential.” Nothing — and I will repeat this, and this is verified in the report by the Department of Justice — none of the e-mails sent or received by me had such a header.	1
Were some of the e-mails sent or received by you referring to our drone program, our covert drone program?	0
Yes, because — of course, there were no discussions of any of the covert actions in process being determined about whether or not to go forward.	0
But every part of our government had to deal with questions, and the secretary of state’s office was first and foremost.	0
So there are ways of talking about the drone program…	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
And you said you thought your communications on that were fairly routine?	0
Well, let me say, the FBI just released their report about their investigation, they discussed drone matters in the unclassified section of their report.	0
But Director Comey also said this after reviewing all the information.	0
He said there is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton’s position should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation.	0
Well, Matt, I just respectfully point to the hundreds of experienced foreign policy experts, diplomats, defense officials who were communicating information on the unclassified system because it was necessary to answer questions and to be able publicly to go as far as we could, which was not acknowledging the program.	0
But I would be in Pakistan, as I was on several occasions.	0
There might very well have been a strike.	0
I would be asked in a public setting, in an interview, about it.	0
It was known to have happened.	0
We had to have an answer that did not move into classified area.	0
And I think we handled that appropriately.	0
You mentioned you’re in Pakistan.	0
Some of the e-mails you sent and received happened while you were overseas.	0
And Director Comey also said that while they have no proof, we assessed that it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal e-mail accounts.	0
Matt, there is no evidence.	0
Of course anything is possible.	0
But what is factual is the State Department system was hacked.	0
Most of the government systems are way behind the curve.	0
We’ve had hacking repeatedly, even in the White House.	0
There is no evidence my system was hacked.	0
Let us bring in Hallie Jackson of NBC News who’s been covering this campaign.	0
She’s getting questions from our veterans.	0
Hallie, who are you with?	0
Hi, Matt.	0
I’m with Lieutenant Jon Lester (ph), who will stand with me here.	0
He began his military career by enlisting in the Air Force and then switched over to the Navy before he retired, where he flew P-3 Orions in Desert Storm and in Desert Shield.	0
He’s a Republican, and he has this question for you, Secretary Clinton.	0
Thank you.	0
Secretary Clinton, thank you very much for coming tonight.	0
As a naval flight officer, I held a top secret sensitive compartmentalized information clearance.	0
And that provided me access to materials and information highly sensitive to our warfighting capabilities.	0
Had I communicated this information not following prescribed protocols, I would have been prosecuted and imprisoned.	0
Secretary Clinton, how can you expect those such as myself who were and are entrusted with America’s most sensitive information to have any confidence in your leadership as president when you clearly corrupted our national security?	0
Well, I appreciate your concern and also your experience.	0
But let me try to make the distinctions that I think are important for me to answer your question.	0
First, as I said to Matt, you know and I know classified material is designated.	0
It is marked.	0
There is a header so that there is no dispute at all that what is being communicated to or from someone who has that access is marked classified.	0
And what we have here is the use of an unclassified system by hundreds of people in our government to send information that was not marked, there were no headers, there was no statement, top secret, secret, or confidential.	0
I communicated about classified material on a wholly separate system.	0
I took it very seriously.	0
When I traveled, I went into one of those little tents that I’m sure you’ve seen around the world because we didn’t want there to be any potential for someone to have embedded a camera to try to see whatever it is that I was seeing that was designated, marked, and headed as classified.	0
Let us…	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
So I did exactly what I should have done and I take it very seriously, always have, always will.	0
Sir, thank you.	0
Thank you very much for your question.	0
Secretary Clinton, let’s talk about your vote in favor of the war in Iraq.	0
You’ve since said it was a mistake.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
Obviously, it was not something you said you would do again.	0
I asked before for people to raise their hand if you served in Iraq.	0
Can you do it again?	0
How do you think these people feel when the person running to be their commander-in-chief says her vote to go to war in Iraq was a mistake?	0
Look, I think that the decision to go to war in Iraq was a mistake.	0
And I have said that my voting to give President Bush that authority was, from my perspective, my mistake.	0
I also believe that it is imperative that we learn from the mistakes, like after- action reports are supposed to do, and so we must learn what led us down that path so that it never happens again.	0
I think I’m in the best possible position to be able to understand that and prevent it.	0
But I will say this.	0
I’m asking to be judged on the totality of my record, what I’ve done for our veterans as first lady, as senator, what I’ve done for Gold Star Families, working with them to increase the death benefit from $12,000 to $100,000, working with Republicans, like Lindsey Graham, to get TRICARE for our National Guard members who didn’t have health care unless they were deployed, working to provide more support for the care of our veterans, those who are wounded, working with the Fisher family, now into the third generation of caring for our fallen heroes, working with John McCain to raise money for Brooke Medical Center’s Intrepid Center to take care of those who are coming back with profound injuries, working on TBI and PTSD and so much more, working with groups to end veteran suicide, like TAPS.	0
So, yes…	0
I’m going to get on to that subject in a second.	0
There was — there was a mistake.	0
Now, my opponent was for the war in Iraq.	0
He says he wasn’t.	0
You can go back and look at the record.	0
He supported it.	0
He told Howard Stern he supported it.	0
So he supported it before it happened, he supported it as it was happening, and he is on record as supporting it after it happened.	0
I have taken responsibility for my decision.	0
Let me go to another…	0
He refuses to take responsibility for his support.	0
That is a judgment issue.	0
Let me go to another question.	0
Hallie?	0
(OFF-MIKE) who served in the Air Force for nearly a decade, where she was an intelligence specialist, specializing in countering violent extremism.	0
Like you, Secretary Clinton, she’s a Democrat and she has this question for you.	0
Thank you.	0
Secretary Clinton, to your point, you have had an extensive record with military intervention.	0
How do you respond to progressives like myself who worry and have concerns that your hawkish foreign policy will continue?	0
And what is your plan to end wasteful war campaigns in which our peers, servicewomen and men, continue to be killed and wounded?	0
Well, I assume you’re talking about Iraq, because of my vote, and you probably are talking about Libya, because of the role that I played in the administration’s decision about whether to take on Gadhafi.	0
But before I get to that, let me say very clearly: I view force as a last resort, not a first choice.	0
I will do everything in my power to make sure that our men and women in the military are fully prepared for any challenge that they may have to face on our behalf.	0
But I will also be as careful as I can in making the most significant decisions any president and commander-in-chief can make about sending our men and women into harm’s way.	0
With respect to Libya, again, there’s no difference between my opponent and myself.	0
He’s on record extensively supporting intervention in Libya, when Gadhafi was threatening to massacre his population.	1
I put together a coalition that included NATO, included the Arab League, and we were able to save lives.	0
We did not lose a single American in that action.	0
And I think taking that action was the right decision.	0
Not taking it, and permitting there to be an ongoing civil war in Libya, would have been as dangerous and threatening as what we are now seeing in Syria.	0
I’m going to jump in.	0
Thank you very much for your question.	0
Let me ask you about the Iran nuclear deal.	0
It was signed under Secretary Kerry; it was begun under you.	0
You started those talks.	0
Right, I did.	0
You have said you expect the Iranians to cheat, you think they’ll buy time, and perhaps stay along their course to building a nuclear weapon.	0
If they cheat, Secretary Clinton, will you have any course of action other than a military course of action?	0
Would you enter into negotiations with again (ph)?	0
Would you go back to economic sanctions knowing they cheated and are then closer to a nuclear weapon?	0
Matt, look, let me put this in context, because this is one of the most important strategic questions we face.	0
When I became secretary of state, the Iranians were on a fast track to acquiring the material necessary to get a nuclear weapon.	0
That had happened the prior eight years.	0
They mastered the nuclear fuel cycle, they built covert facilities, they stocked them with centrifuges, and they were moving forward.	0
What was our decision?	0
Our decision was to try to put together an international coalition that included Russia and China to exert the kind of pressure through sanctions that the United States alone could not do.	0
Right, but you’ve said that you think they’re going to cheat…	0
Now, wait, let me — look, this is an important issue.	0
I know we’re on TV and we don’t have a lot of time.	0
I want to get to a lot of questions.	0
I will talk quickly.	0
But I want people to understand this.	0
So, yes, I put together the coalition.	0
We imposed the sanctions.	0
We got them to the negotiating table.	0
And after I left, we got the agreement.	0
That agreement put a lid on their nuclear weapons program and imposed intrusive inspections.	0
I have said we are going to enforce it to the letter.	0
Do you think they’re playing us?	0
On the nuclear issue, no.	0
I think we have enough insight into what they’re doing to be able to say we have to distrust but verify.	0
What I am focused on is all the other malicious activities of the Iranians — ballistic missiles, support for terrorists, being involved in Syria, Yemen, and other places, supporting Hezbollah, Hamas.	0
But here’s the difference, Matt.	0
I would rather as president be dealing with Iran on all of those issues without having to worry as much about their racing for a nuclear weapon.	0
So we have made the world safer; we just have to make sure it’s enforced.	0
Hallie?	0
I’m with Kenneth Anderson (ph).	0
He’s one of our undecided voters here.	0
He considers himself an independent.	0
He earned the rank of sergeant in the Marine Corps, where he was an Arabic translator during three tours in Iraq.	0
Kenneth, you have a question for Secretary Clinton.	0
Yes, Secretary Clinton, last October you said that surveys of veterans show that they’re overall satisfied with their treatment and that the problems with the V.A.	0
aren’t as widespread as they’re made out to be.	0
So do you think the problems with the V.A.	0
have been made to seem worse than they really are?	0
Look, I was outraged by the stories that came out about the V.A.	0
And I have been very clear about the necessity for doing whatever is required to move the V.A.	0
into the 21st century, to provide the kind of treatment options that our veterans today desperately need and deserve.	0
And that’s what I will do as president.	0
But I will not let the V.A.	0
be privatized.	0
And I do think there is an agenda out there, supported by my opponent, to do just that.	1
I think that would be very disastrous for our military veterans.	0
So I’m going to do everything I can — I’m going to have a meeting every week in the Oval Office.	0
We’re going to bring the V.A.	0
people, we’re going to bring the DOD people, because we’ve got to have a better fit between getting mustered out and getting into the V.A.	0
system, sometimes — and you probably know this, Sergeant — I’ve met so many vets who get mustered out, who leave the service, they can’t find their records from DOD, and those records never make it to the V.A.	0
They feel like they’re living in a funhouse.	0
They have to go over the same things over and over.	0
We’re living in a technological world.	0
You cannot tell me we can’t do a better job getting that information.	0
And so I’m going to focus on this.	0
I’m going to work with everybody.	0
I’m going to make them work together.	0
And I’m going to jump in.	0
And we’re going to fix the problems in the V.A.	0
Sergeant, thank you very much for your question.	0
Let’s talk about veterans and suicide.	0
Yes, let’s, please.	0
It’s an alarming, alarming story.	0
The population of veterans has a rate of suicide far above the general population.	1
Twenty — twenty suicides a day.	1
What are you going to do to stop it?	0
Well, this month is Suicide Prevention Awareness Month.	0
And I’ve spent a lot of time with family members, survivors, who’ve lost a loved one after he or she came home, sometimes suffering from PTSD or TBI or sexual assault, being handed bags of opioids, not being given an appropriate treatment to help that particular person, which is something, to go back to the sergeant’s question, we have to change.	0
So I rolled out my mental health agenda last week, and I have a whole section devoted to veterans’ mental health.	0
And we’ve got to remove the stigma.	0
We’ve got to help people currently serving not to feel that if they report their sense of unease, their depression, that somehow it’s going to be a mark against them.	0
We have to do more about addiction, not only drugs, but also alcohol.	0
So I have put forth a really robust agenda, working with a lot of the VSOs and other groups, like TAPS, who have been thinking about this and trying to figure out what we’re going to do to help our veterans re-enter civilian life and live full, productive lives.	0
Hallie?	0
I’m with Ernie Young.	0
Come on up here with me, a former Army captain, who led troops during tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan.	0
He’s an independent voter.	0
And you have a question for the secretary.	0
Secretary Clinton, as an Army veteran, a commander-in- chief’s to empathize with servicemembers and their families is important to me.	0
The ability to truly understand implications and consequences of your decisions, actions, or inactions.	0
How will you determine when and where to deploy troops directly into harm’s way, especially to combat ISIS?	0
As briefly as you can.	0
We have to defeat ISIS.	0
That is my highest counterterrorism goal.	0
And we’ve got to do it with air power.	0
We’ve got to do it with much more support for the Arabs and the Kurds who will fight on the ground against ISIS.	0
We have to squeeze them by continuing to support the Iraqi military.	0
They’ve taken back Ramadi, Fallujah.	0
They’ve got to hold them.	0
They’ve got to now get into Mosul.	0
We’re going to work to make sure that they have the support — they have special forces, as you know, they have enablers, they have surveillance, intelligence, reconnaissance help.	0
They are not going to get ground troops.	0
We are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again.	0
And we’re not putting ground troops into Syria.	0
We’re going to defeat ISIS without committing American ground troops.	0
So those are the kinds of decisions we have to make on a case-by-case basis.	0
And, remember, when I became secretary of state, we had 200,000 troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan.	0
And I’m very grateful that we have brought home the vast majority of those.	0
We have a residual force, as you know, in Afghanistan.	0
We have built up several thousands of the folks that I’ve talked about who are assisting in the fight against ISIS.	0
But it is in our national security interest to defeat ISIS.	0
And I intend to make that happen.	0
Thank you very much for your question.	0
And as part of it, we’re going after Baghdadi, the leader, because it will help us focus our attention, just like going after bin Laden helped us focus our attention…	0
Secretary…	0
… in the fight against Al Qaida in the Afghanistan- Pakistan theater.	0
Secretary Clinton, I am fast running out of time.	0
I want to get to one of the concerns just about everybody in this country, and that is terror attacks on our soil.	0
Right.	0
Either directed by ISIS or inspired by ISIS.	0
Would your message as the next president of the United States or potential next president be to Americans that we simply are living in the reality that those attacks will happen?	0
And can you guarantee people that after four years of a Clinton presidency, they will be safer on the streets of San Bernardino or Boston than they are today?	0
Well, Matt, I’m going to do everything in my power to make sure that that’s the result.	0
I’m not going to, you know, promise something that I think most thinking Americans know is going to be a huge challenge, and here’s why.	0
We’ve got to have an intelligence surge.	0
We’ve got to get a lot more cooperation out of Europe, out of the Middle East.	0
We have to do a better job of not only collecting and analyzing the intelligence we do have, but distributing it much more quickly down the ladder to state and local law enforcement.	0
We also have to do a better job combating ISIS online, where they recruit, where they radicalize.	0
And I don’t think we’re doing as much as we can.	0
We need to work with Silicon Valley.	0
We need to work with our experts in our government.	0
We have got to disrupt, we have got to take them on in the arena of ideas that, unfortunately, pollute and capture the minds of vulnerable people.	0
So we need to wage this war against ISIS from the air, on the ground, and online, in cyberspace.	0
And here at home, for goodness’s sakes, we have to finally pass a law prohibiting people on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in the United States of America.	0
So we’ve got work to do.	0
I know we can do that work.	0
I’m meeting with a group of terror experts, counterterrorism experts.	0
But I want to just say one additional thing.	0
I’ve got 30 seconds left.	0
Matt Olsen, the former director of the National Center on Counterterrorism, has a great article out today saying the last thing we need to do is to play into the hands of ISIS.	0
Going after American Muslims, defaming a Gold Star family, the family of Captain Khan, making it more difficult for us to have a coalition with Muslim majority nations…	0
And we tried to have an agreement…	0
… that is not going to help us to succeed in defeating ISIS and protecting our American homeland.	0
Secretary Hillary Clinton, thank you very much.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you all.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you so much.	0
Too short a time.	0
I know.	0
We’re going to take a break.	0
We’re going to have much more with her competitor, Donald Trump, right after this.	0
You’re watching NBC News special, the Commander-in-Chief Forum.	0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
We welcome you back now to this NBC News special, the Commander-in-Chief Forum.	0
Tonight we’re speaking with the two major party presidential nominees to find out where they stand on the critical issues.	0
Now, please welcome the Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Good to see you.	0
Thank you, Matt.	0
Thank you very much for joining us.	0
Thank you.	0
You heard me say to Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, and it didn’t completely work out toward the end there, as much as possible I’d like you to tell our veterans and our people at home why you are prepared for the role of commander-in-chief and try to keep the attacks to a minimum.	0
We’ve had a year of that and maybe 60 more days of it.	0
To a minimum, absolutely.	0
OK, perfect.	0
To a minimum.	0
I guess that’s a question of definition.	0
I guess.	0
Any time you interview a president, sitting or past president, they will tell you that the most daunting…	0
Was I supposed to answer this question?	0
No, no, no, I mean just keep the attacks to a minimum.	0
Any time you talk to a president, they’ll tell you the most daunting part of the job is the role of commander-in-chief.	0
Right.	0
What have you experienced in your personal life or your professional life that you believe prepares you to make the decisions that a commander-in-chief has to make?	0
Well, I’ve built a great company.	0
I’ve been all over the world.	0
I’ve dealt with foreign countries.	0
I’ve done very well, as an example, tremendously well dealing with China and dealing with so many of the countries that are just ripping this country.	0
They are just taking advantage of us like nobody’s ever seen before.	0
And I’ve had great experience dealing on an international basis.	0
I look today and I see Russian planes circling our planes.	0
They’re taunting us.	0
I see in Iran, I see the boats taunting our ships, our destroyers, and I think…	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
But what have you done in your life that prepares you to send men and women of the United States into harm’s way?	0
Well, I think the main thing is I have great judgment.	0
I have good judgment.	0
I know what’s going on.	0
I’ve called so many of the shots.	0
And I happened to hear Hillary Clinton say that I was not against the war in Iraq.	0
I was totally against the war in Iraq.	1
From a — you can look at Esquire magazine from ’04.	0
You can look at before that.	0
And I was against the war in Iraq because I said it’s going to totally destabilize the Middle East, which it has.	0
It has absolutely been a disastrous war, and by the way, perhaps almost as bad was the way Barack Obama got out.	0
That was a disaster.	0
People talk about you and commander-in-chief, and not just Secretary Clinton, but some of your Republican opponents in the primary season, and they wonder about your temperament.	0
They say, does Donald Trump have the temperament to be commander-in-chief?	0
You said something recently that I found interesting.	0
You admitted that sometimes in the heat of a debate or when you’re talking about a lot of issues you say things that you later regret.	0
So can we afford that with a commander-in-chief — to have a commander-in-chief who says things that he later regrets?	0
Well, when you say regret, yeah, sure, I regret.	0
But in the meantime, I beat 16 people and here I am.	0
So, you know, to a certain extent there is a regret.	0
I would have liked to have done it in a nicer manner.	0
But I had 16 very talented people that I had to go through.	0
And that was a lot of people.	0
But when you say…	0
That was a record, Matt.	0
That was a record in the history of Republican politics.	0
I was able to get more votes than anybody ever has gotten in the history of Republican politics.	1
But when you say inflammatory things… (CROSSTALK)	0
… in a presidential campaign, it’s different than saying them when you’re commander-in-chief.	0
If you say things you regret…	0
I agree with you.	0
… when you’re commander-in-chief, you can spark a conflict, you can destabilize a region, you can put American lives at risk.	0
Can we afford to take that risk with you?	0
Well, I think absolutely.	0
I think if you saw what happened in Mexico the other day, where I went there, I had great relationships, everything else.	0
I let them know where the United States stands.	0
I mean, we’ve been badly hurt by Mexico, both on the border and with taking all of our jobs or a big percentage of our jobs.	0
And if you look at what happened, look at the aftermath today where the people that arranged the trip in Mexico have been forced out of government.	0
That’s how well we did.	0
Back in August…	0
And that’s how well we’re going to have to do, Matt.	0
Back in August, when you admitted that you regret some of the things you said, you also said this.	0
“I can promise you this: I will always tell you the truth.”	0
It’s true.	0
So let me read some of the things you’ve said.	0
“I know more about ISIS than the generals do.	0
Believe me.” Was that the truth?	0
Well, the generals under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have not been successful.	0
ISIS…	0
Do you know more about ISIS than they do?	0
I think under the leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, the generals have been reduced to rubble.	0
They have been reduced to a point where it’s embarrassing for our country.	0
You have a force of 30,000 or so people.	0
Nobody really knows.	0
But probably 30,000 people.	0
And I can just see the great — as an example- General George Patton spinning in his grave as ISIS we can’t beat.	0
We had the greatest…	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Yeah, you’ve said if we had MacArthur today or if we had Patton today, we would not have ISIS, that the rise of these military commanders that we have today, they come up the chain of command, and by the time they get to the top, they’re too politically correct.	0
And we know that’s not a compliment coming from you.	0
Have you lost faith in the military commanders?	0
I have great faith in the military.	0
I have great faith in certain of the commanders, certainly.	0
But I have no faith in Hillary Clinton or the leadership.	0
You look at what’s happened.	0
And, you know, when she comes in and starts saying, oh, I would have done this, I would have — she’s been there for 30 years.	0
I mean, we need change, Matt.	0
We have to have it, and we have to have it fast.	0
Let’s go to Hallie Jackson in our crowd.	0
Hallie?	0
I’m with Phillip Clay (ph), who was a public affairs officer in the Marine Corps.	0
He spent a year in Anbar province in Iraq.	0
He left the military with the rank of captain, service that inspired him to write a book.	0
He’s a Democrat, and he has this question for you, Mr. Trump.	0
Mr. Trump, over the past 15 years, a lot of U.S. troops have bled and died securing towns and provinces from Iraq to Afghanistan, only to have insurgent groups like ISIS spring back the moment we leave.	0
Now, you’ve claimed to have a secret plan to defeat ISIS.	0
But you’re hardly the first politician to promise a quick victory and a speedy homecoming.	0
So assuming we do defeat ISIS, what next?	0
What is your plan for the region to ensure that a group like them doesn’t just come back?	0
Sure.	0
I mean, part of the problem that we’ve had is we go in, we defeat somebody, and then we don’t know what we’re doing after that.	0
We lose it, like as an example, you look at Iraq, what happened, how badly that was handled.	0
And then when President Obama took over, likewise, it was a disaster.	0
It was actually somewhat stable.	0
I don’t think could ever be very stable to where we should have never gone into in the first place.	0
But he came in.	0
He said when we go out — and he took everybody out.	0
And really, ISIS was formed.	1
This was a terrible decision.	0
And frankly, we never even got a shot.	0
And if you really look at the aftermath of Iraq, Iran is going to be taking over Iraq.	0
They’ve been doing it.	0
And it’s not a pretty picture.	0
The — and I think you know — because you’ve been watching me I think for a long time — I’ve always said, shouldn’t be there, but if we’re going to get out, take the oil.	0
If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn’t have ISIS, because ISIS formed with the power and the wealth of that oil.	0
How were we going to take the oil?	0
How were we going to do that?	0
Just we would leave a certain group behind and you would take various sections where they have the oil.	0
They have — people don’t know this about Iraq, but they have among the largest oil reserves in the world, in the entire world.	0
And we’re the only ones, we go in, we spend $3 trillion, we lose thousands and thousands of lives, and then, Matt, what happens is, we get nothing.	0
You know, it used to be to the victor belong the spoils.	0
Now, there was no victor there, believe me.	0
There was no victor.	0
But I always said: Take the oil.	0
One of the benefits we would have had if we took the oil is ISIS would not have been able to take oil and use that oil…	0
Let me stay on ISIS…	0
… to fuel themselves.	0
Let me stay on ISIS.	0
When we’ve met in the past and we’ve talked, you say things like I’m going to bomb the expletive out of them very quickly.	0
And when people like me press you for details like that gentleman just said on what your plan is, you very often say, I’m not going to give you the details because I want to be unpredictable.	0
Absolutely.	0
The word is unpredictable.	0
But yesterday, you actually told us a little bit about your plan in your speech.	0
You said this.	0
Quote, “We’re going to convene my top generals and they will have 30 days to submit a plan for soundly and quickly defeating ISIS.” So is the plan you’ve been hiding this whole time asking someone else for their plan?	0
No.	0
But when I do come up with a plan that I like and that perhaps agrees with mine, or maybe doesn’t — I may love what the generals come back with.	0
I will convene…	0
But you have your own plan?	0
I have a plan.	0
But I want to be — I don’t want to — look.	0
I have a very substantial chance of winning.	0
Make America great again.	0
We’re going to make America great again.	0
I have a substantial chance of winning.	0
If I win, I don’t want to broadcast to the enemy exactly what my plan is.	0
But you’re going to…	0
And let me tell you, if I like maybe a combination of my plan and the generals’ plan, or the generals’ plan, if I like their plan, Matt, I’m not going to call you up and say, “Matt, we have a great plan.” This is what Obama does.	0
“We’re going to leave Iraq on a certain day.”	0
But you’re going to convene a panel of generals, and you’ve already said you know more about ISIS than those generals do.	0
Well, they’ll probably be different generals, to be honest with you.	0
I mean, I’m looking at the generals, today, you probably saw, I have a piece of paper here, I could show it, 88 generals and admirals endorsed me today.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
It’s a numbers game.	0
Hillary Clinton claims more numbers.	0
Well, it’s not really — it’s not — yeah, numbers.	0
People that have been losing for us for a long period of time.	0
I mean, the fact is, we have had the worst and you could even say the dumbest foreign policy.	0
Our results are so bad.	0
We would have been better off had we never, ever spent $2 in that part of the world.	0
You recently — you recently received two intelligence briefings.	0
Yes, I did.	0
Did anything in that briefing, without going into specifics, shock or alarm you?	0
Yes.	0
Very much so.	0
Did you learn new things in that briefing?	0
First of all, I have great respect for the people that gave us the briefings.	0
We — they were terrific people.	0
They were experts on Iraq and Iran and different parts of — and Russia.	0
But, yes, there was one thing that shocked me.	0
And it just seems to me that what they said President Obama and Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, who is another total disaster, did exactly the opposite.	0
Did you learn anything in that briefing — again, not going into specifics — that makes you reconsider some of the things you say you can accomplish, like defeating ISIS quickly?	0
No, I didn’t learn anything from that standpoint.	0
What I did learn is that our leadership, Barack Obama, did not follow what our experts and our truly — when they call it intelligence, it’s there for a reason — what our experts said to do.	0
Hallie?	0
And I was very, very surprised.	0
In almost every instance.	0
And I could tell you.	0
I have pretty good with the body language.	0
I could tell they were not happy.	0
Our leaders did not follow what they were recommending.	0
Hallie?	0
I’m with former Army Captain Sue Fulton, who was a member of the First West Point class to include women.	0
She served as a signal corps officer in Germany.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
She’s a Democrat, and she has this question for you, Mr. Trump.	0
Mr. Trump.	0
Hi, thank you very much.	0
Thank you.	0
Do you believe that an undocumented person who serves — who wants to serve in the U.S. armed forces deserves to stay in this country legally?	0
I think that when you serve in the armed forces, that’s a very special situation, and I could see myself working that out, absolutely.	0
So she’s saying has already served in the armed forces or wants to serve, plans to serve?	0
Plans to serve.	0
Plans to serve in the armed forces.	0
As you know, under DACA, we already have people who are undocumented who are serving.	0
I think military is a very special thing.	0
If they plan on serving, if they get in, I would absolutely hold those people — now, we have to be very careful.	0
We have to vet very carefully.	0
Everybody would agree with that.	0
But the answer is, it would be a very special circumstance, yes.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you very much for your question.	0
Hallie, you have another one?	0
I do.	0
Alex Gronkowski (ph) was an Army staff sergeant assigned in special operations.	0
He was stationed at Fort Bragg and was deployed to Afghanistan and other places across the Middle East.	0
He has not decided who he will vote for yet in November.	0
And you have a question for Mr. Trump.	0
I do.	0
Mr. Trump, as you know, tensions between the United States and Russia have been at the highest level since the Cold War.	0
In your first 120 days of presidency, how would you de-escalate the tensions?	0
And more importantly, what steps would you take to bring Mr. Putin and the Russian government back to negotiating table?	0
I think I would have a very good relationship with many foreign leaders.	0
I think it’s very sad, when you look at Barack Obama, as an example, lands Air Force One in China, and they don’t want to put out stairs to get off the plane.	1
And he has to use the stairs that mechanics use to get up and down to fix the plane.	0
They wouldn’t give him stairs.	0
I think it’s very sad, when he lands in Saudi Arabia, and he lands in Cuba, and there aren’t high officials to even greet him.	0
This is the first time in the history — the storied history of Air Force One.	0
I think I would have a very, very good relationship with Putin.	0
And I think I would have a very, very good relationship with Russia.	0
As I said, take a look today.	0
Take a look at what happened with their fighter jets circling one of our aircraft in a very dangerous manner.	0
Somebody said less than 10 feet away.	0
This is hostility.	0
And I saw, just two or three days ago, they looked like they were not exactly getting along, but I looked at President Obama and Putin staring at each other.	0
These were not two people that were getting along.	0
And, you know, the beautiful part of getting along, Russia wants to defeat ISIS as badly as we do.	0
If we had a relationship with Russia, wouldn’t it be wonderful if we could work on it together and knock the hell out of ISIS?	0
Wouldn’t that be a wonderful thing?	0
Let me ask you about some of the things you’ve said about Vladimir Putin.	0
You said, I will tell you, in terms of leadership, he’s getting an A, our president is not doing so well.	0
And when referring to a comment that Putin made about you, I think he called you a brilliant leader, you said it’s always a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his country and beyond.	0
Well, he does have an 82 percent approval rating, according to the different pollsters, who, by the way, some of them are based right here.	1
Look, look…	0
He’s also a guy who annexed Crimea, invaded Ukraine, supports Assad in Syria, supports Iran, is trying to undermine our influence in key regions of the world, and according to our intelligence community, probably is the main suspect for the hacking of the DNC computers…	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Well, nobody knows that for a fact.	0
But do you want me to start naming some of the things that President Obama does at the same time?	0
But do you want to be complimented by that former KGB officer?	0
Well, I think when he calls me brilliant, I’ll take the compliment, OK?	1
The fact is, look, it’s not going to get him anywhere.	0
I’m a negotiator.	0
We’re going to take back our country.	0
You look at what’s happening to our country, you look at the depleted military.	0
You look at the fact that we’ve lost our jobs.	0
We’re losing our jobs like we’re a bunch of babies.	0
We’re going to take back our country, Matt.	0
The fact that he calls me brilliant or whatever he calls me is going to have zero impact.	0
But the fact that you say you can get along with him, do you think the day…	0
I think I’d be able to get along with him.	0
Do you think the day that you become president of the United States, he’s going to change his mind on some of these key issues?	0
Possibly.	0
It’s possible.	0
I don’t know, Matt.	0
It’s possible.	0
And it’s not going to have any impact.	0
If he says great things about me, I’m going to say great things about him.	0
I’ve already said, he is really very much of a leader.	0
I mean, you can say, oh, isn’t that a terrible thing — the man has very strong control over a country.	0
Now, it’s a very different system, and I don’t happen to like the system.	0
But certainly, in that system, he’s been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader.	0
We have a divided country.	0
We have a country where you have Hillary Clinton with her e-mails that nobody’s ever seen where she deletes 33,000 e-mails, and that’s after getting a subpoena from Congress.	0
If you do that in private business, you get thrown in jail.	0
Hallie?	0
Steve Korea (ph), here with me, was in the Army Reserves and spent 10 months in Iraq right at the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom.	0
He is a Republican and has this question for you.	0
Good evening, Mr. Trump.	0
Hi.	0
I like what you say about supporting veterans and how they’re important.	0
But I haven’t heard what the actual plans are to continue that support beyond words.	0
How do you translate those words to action after you take office?	0
Well, I love that question, because I’ve been very close to the vets.	0
You see the relationship I have with the vets just by looking at the polls.	0
In fact, today a poll came out.	0
And my relationship has been very good.	0
I have a very, very powerful plan that’s on my website that you possibly saw.	0
One of the big problems is the wait time.	0
Vets are waiting six days, seven days, eight days.	0
And by the way, Hillary Clinton six months ago said the vets are being treated essentially just fine, there’s no real problem, it’s over-exaggerated.	1
She did say that.	0
No, no, she went on after that and laid out a litany of problems within the V.A.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Look, I mean, she made up half of the things she said about me.	0
I’m telling you, this is — she said she was satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration.	0
Now, under my plan, if you’ve got to wait — and, by the way, people are dying on line.	0
They’re dying, waiting, waiting to get to see a doctor.	0
They’re waiting five days and six days.	0
Under a part of my plan, if they have that long wait, they walk outside, they go to the local doctor, they choose the doctor, they choose the hospital, whether it’s public or private, they get themselves better.	0
In many cases, it’s a minor procedure or a pill or just a prescription.	0
And they end up dying because they can’t get to see the doctor.	0
We will pay the bill.	0
They go outside, they get a doctor, they get a prescription, they do what they have to do, and we pay the bill.	0
That is something that I have been praised — and, by the way, I never said take the V.A.	0
— take the Veterans Administration private.	0
I wouldn’t do that.	0
Too much respect for our people.	0
I would never do that.	0
OK.	0
I heard it was said that I said that.	0
I would not do that.	0
But I do believe — I do believe, when you’re waiting in line for six, seven days, you should never be in a position like that.	0
You go out, you see the doctor, you get yourself taken care of.	0
Hallie, you’ve got another question.	0
I do.	0
Rachel Fredericks (ph), who specialized in aviations operations in the Marine Corps, serving stateside, she lost two friends to suicide.	0
And you now struggle yourself with PTSD.	0
She’s a Republican, but leaning towards you, still undecided a little bit.	0
Rachel, you have a question for Mr. Trump.	0
I do.	0
Mr. Trump, I wanted to ask what your plan will be to stop 20 veterans a day from killing themselves.	0
And actually it’s 22.	0
And it’s almost impossible to conceive that this is happening in our country, 20 to 22 people a day are killing themselves.	0
A lot of it is they’re killing themselves over the fact that they can’t — they’re under tremendous pain and they can’t see a doctor.	0
We’re going to speed up the process.	0
We’re going to create a great mental health division.	0
They need help.	0
They need help.	0
They need tremendous help.	0
And we’re doing nothing for them.	0
The V.A.	0
is really almost, you could say, a corrupt enterprise.	0
If you look at what’s going on, as an example, Matt, in Arizona, where they caught people stealing, and they can’t even do anything about it, they can’t even fire the people.	0
So we are going to make it efficient and good.	0
And if it’s not good, you’re going out to private hospitals, public hospitals, and doctors.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Hallie, one more?	0
Donald Day (ph) here, who served as a radio operator in the Marine Corps in the Vietnam era.	0
He had tours of duty in Southeast Asia and in Europe.	0
He’s also a Democrat and has this question for you.	0
Mr. Trump, I have a daughter who is interested in joining the service, but when she researched the military, she saw the stats on sexual assault and decided not to go.	0
I have a concern about the rape of women in our armed forces.	0
As president, what specifically would you do to support all victims of sexual assault in the military?	0
It’s a great question.	0
And it’s a massive problem.	0
The numbers are staggering, hard to believe, even.	0
But we’re going to have to run it very tight.	0
I at the same time want to keep the court system within the military.	0
I don’t think it should be outside of the military.	0
But we have to come down very, very hard on that.	0
And your daughter is absolutely right, it is a massive problem.	0
But we have to do something about that problem.	0
And the best thing we can do is set up a court system within the military.	0
Right now, the court system practically doesn’t exist.	0
It takes too long.	0
In 2013, on this subject, you tweeted this, quote, “26,000 unreported sexual assaults in the military, only 238 convictions.	0
What did these geniuses expect when they put men and women together?”	0
Well, it is — it is — it is a correct tweet.	0
There are many people that think that that’s absolutely correct.	0
And we need to have a…	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
So this should have been expected?	0
And does that mean the only way to fix it is to take women out of the military?	0
Well, it’s happening, right?	0
And, by the way, since then, it’s gotten worse.	0
No, not to take them out, but something has to be happen.	0
Right now, part of the problem is nobody gets prosecuted.	0
You have reported and — the gentleman can tell you, you have the report of rape and nobody gets prosecuted.	0
There are no consequence.	0
When you have somebody that does something so evil, so bad as that, there has to be consequence for that person.	0
You have to go after that person.	0
Right now, nobody’s doing anything.	0
Look at the small number of results.	0
I mean, that’s part of the problem.	0
So many of the issues that we’ve talked about with you, Mr. Trump, tonight, and Secretary Clinton, are so complex that even career military people and career diplomats and politicians have trouble getting their arms around them.	0
Right.	0
You’ve had a very different background, in business.	0
So nobody would expect you to have taken over the last 20 years really deep dives into some of these issues.	0
But I’m curious about what you’re doing now.	0
What kind of research are you doing now?	0
What kind of homework are you doing?	0
What kind of things are you reading as you prepare for the day in two months where you might be elected the next president of the United States?	0
Sure.	0
Well, in the front row, you have four generals.	0
You have admirals.	0
We have people all throughout the audience that I’m dealing with.	0
Right here is a list that was just printed today of 88 admirals and generals that I meet with and I talk to.	0
How much time are you spending on this?	0
I’m also — a lot.	0
A lot.	0
And I’m doing a lot of different things.	0
Don’t forget, we’re running a big campaign.	0
We’re doing very well.	0
I’m also, you know, and I’m very much giving it to my children and my executives to run, I’m also partially running a business.	0
I’m campaigning, I’m running a business.	0
I’ve got a lot of hats right now.	0
But we’re doing very well.	0
But in the meantime, I am studying.	0
And I’m meeting constantly — you see — you see General Flynn and you see some of the folks that we have, and they’re scattered throughout the audience.	0
So we have admirals, we have generals, we have colonels.	0
We have a lot of people that I respect.	0
And I think I’ve learned a lot.	0
But I think, also, I certainly — I really feel I have a common sense on the various issues that you’re talking about, Matt.	0
You said in the speech today, you said history shows that when America is not prepared is when the danger is the greatest.	0
And we’re not prepared.	0
Will you be prepared on day one, if you’re elected president of the United States, to tackle these complex national security issues?	0
One hundred percent.	0
Hey, Matt, again, she made a mistake on Libya.	0
She made a terrible mistake on Libya.	0
And the next thing, I mean, not only did she make the mistake, but then they complicated the mistake by having no management once they bombed you know what out of Gadhafi.	0
I mean, she made a terrible mistake on Libya.	0
And part of it was the management aftereffect.	0
I think that we have great management talents, great management skills.	0
But you are prepared?	0
And I have to tell you — totally prepared.	0
But remember this.	0
I found this subject and these subjects of interest all of my life, Matt.	0
This hasn’t been over the last 14 months.	0
I’ve found these substantiates of tremendous interest.	0
That’s why they were asking me about Iraq 14 years ago.	0
They were asking me these questions.	0
They don’t ask businesspeople those questions.	0
Let me end in kind of the same place I started.	0
Have you given much thought, Mr. Trump, if you’re elected president and commander-in-chief, to that moment where you’re going to have to make that first decision that puts American men and women in harm’s way?	0
I think it’s the most difficult decision you can possibly ever make.	0
You’re talking about death.	0
And we’re talking death to not just our side.	0
We’re talking death all over.	0
I would be very, very cautious.	0
I think I’d be a lot slower.	0
She has a happy trigger.	0
You look, she votes for the wars, she goes in Libya…	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Have you thought about personally the emotional burden of that moment?	0
I think it’s a tremendous burden.	0
I think there is no greater burden that anybody could have.	0
I’ve been preparing this for a long time.	0
And, you know, my theme is make America great again.	0
We’re going to make America great again.	0
But, Matt, we’ve also got to make America strong again.	0
And right now, we are not strong.	0
Believe me.	0
We have a depleted military.	0
We have the greatest people in the world in our military.	0
But it is very sadly depleted.	0
The Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald Trump.	0
Thank you, Matt.	0
Thank you.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We’re going to be much — we’ll be back with much more from the Intrepid carrier on this Commander-in-Chief Forum right after this.	0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
There’s a lot of people we want to thank for making tonight a success, the presidential nominees themselves, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.	0
We want to thank the many veterans in our audience for their questions and, most importantly, for their service.	0
We want to thank our hosts at the IAVA, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, and, of course, the Intrepid Sea, Air, and Space Museum, this amazing venue.	0
The first presidential debate will be held on September 26th right here on NBC.	0
It’ll be hosted by my colleague, Lester Holt.	0
We hope you’ll tune in for that.	0
And more importantly, we hope you get out and vote this November.	0
Nothing could be more important.	0
Thank you for joining us tonight.	0
For Matt Lauer — I’m Matt Lauer.	0
For all of us at NBC News, we appreciate your tuning in.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Live from The George Washington University in the nation's capital, this is CNN's debate night on the future of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.	0
Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world.	0
I'm Jake Tapper.	0
And I'm Dana Bash.	0
President Trump has made the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act one of his top priorities.	0
To certain members of our audience, that legislation has been a life-saver.	0
To others, it has harmed livelihoods.	0
These defenders and supporters of Obamacare will get to question two leading members of Congress who will shape what comes next.	0
So, please welcome the runners-up for the Democratic and Republican nominations for president, in their first debate, Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... and Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senators, welcome.	0
Please take your positions behind the podiums.	0
Now, before your opening statements, I want to talk about the ground rules that you both agreed to.	0
You will get 90 seconds to answer questions posed to you, 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals.	0
Timing lights will guide you.	0
As we mentioned, a handful of members of our audience, which include both critics and defenders of the Affordable Care Act, will question you, in addition to questions from Jake and myself.	0
As moderators, we will guide the debate.	0
And we will begin with two-minute opening statements on what should happen to health care in America.	0
Senator Sanders?	0
Let me begin by thanking CNN for sponsoring this debate and let me thank all of those who are watching.	0
Let me get right to the point.	0
Senator Cruz, like most Republicans, has said that he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, or so-called Obamacare.	0
Let me tell you what that will mean to the American people.	0
It means that if you are one of 20 million Americans who finally has received health insurance, forget about it, you're gone.	0
You're off health insurance.	0
And that means when you get sick, you ain't going to be able to go to the doctor.	0
And when you end up in the hospital, you'll be paying those bills for the rest of your life, or maybe you'll go bankrupt.	0
What the repeal of the ACA means, that if you are one of 10 million senior citizens who today is struggling with the outrageous cost of prescription drugs, your prescription drug costs are going to go up on average about $2,000.	0
What the repeal of the ACA means is that if you are suffering with cancer, with diabetes, with serious mental illness, you will be put into a position where you may be rejected from any insurance at all, because you have a pre-existing condition.	0
And by the way, women are considered a pre-existing condition by the insurance companies because they might have a baby.	1
Is the ACA perfect?	0
No.	0
Nobody believes that it is.	0
And nobody believes that we do not need to improve it.	0
But the debate is whether we kill it entirely or we make improvements in it.	0
And I will tell you:  Overwhelming majority of the American people say do not simply repeal the ACA.	0
Make improvements.	0
Last point.	0
The United States is the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a right.	1
I believe we should move in that direction.	0
The ACA has been a step forward.	0
We have got to go further and join every other major country on Earth and say that if you are an American, you are guaranteed health care as a right, not a privilege.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, Senator Sanders.	0
Senator Cruz, what should happen with health care in America?	0
Well, Dana, I think I get an opening statement, as well, so I'll start with that.	0
Please.	0
Which is just simply saying thank you.	0
Thank you, guys, for hosting this.	0
Thank you for Bernie for joining this.	0
And thank you to CNN for hosting this.	0
You know, often in politics we have debates that are sound bites, that are 60 seconds or 90 seconds on a topic, and I appreciate CNN devoting real time to this issue, because it matters.	0
Health care is personal in a way that is different from most other political issues.	0
Health care affects our families.	0
It's our moms.	0
Health care is our kids.	0
It's the future.	0
It can quite literally be whether we live or die.	0
And this is an issue where Bernie Sanders and I have fundamentally different approaches.	0
Bernie and the Democrats want government to control health care.	0
I trust you.	0
And I trust your doctors.	0
I think health care works better when you're in charge of your family's health care decisions, when you can sit down with your doctor and decide the care that's best for your family without government setting rules, without government rationing, without wait periods.	0
And that's the fundamental divide we're having.	0
You know, six years ago, when Obamacare was being adopted, it's possible that reasonable minds could have differed on whether this was a good idea.	0
But six years into it, we've seen the results.	0
We remember Obamacare, a series of promises were made to us by President Obama.	0
Number one, most infamously, if you like your plan, you can keep your plan.	0
President Obama said that 37 different times.	0
As 6 million people across this country discovered, that was not true when they had their plans canceled against their wishes.	0
If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.	0
Again, millions discovered that wasn't true.	0
And President Obama promised the American people the average family's premiums would drop $2,500.	0
Not only wasn't that true, but the average family's premiums have risen $5,000.	0
That's why people are unhappy with this disaster of a law, because it's driven up the cost of health care, it's reduced your choice, it's reduced your freedom, and this last election was a referendum on Obamacare, and the American people quite rightly decided this plan isn't working.	0
Senator Cruz, thank you so much.	0
We have a lot of questions for both of you from members of the audience, but before we get to them, I want to ask about a pressing matter on Capitol Hill, and I'll start with you, Senator Cruz.	0
House Speaker Paul Ryan said today that the legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare would be done this year.	0
On Sunday, President Trump said that a plan may not be rolled out until 2018.	0
Not that it would, but that it may not be rolled out until 2018.	0
Is anything less than a full and swift repeal and replacement of Obamacare a broken promise?	0
Listen, I think everyone agrees there is an urgency to honor the promises we made.	0
You know, since Obamacare was passed, we've had multiple elections, 2010, 2014, 2016, where the number-one issue in each of those elections was Obamacare.	0
And, you know, what we're arguing here was argued in front of the American people.	0
The Democrats said over and over again, if Obamacare is repealed, all these people are going to lose coverage.	0
Now, that's not true, and we're going to get into that.	0
But that was the argument that was made to the American people.	0
And 2010, 2014, 2016 I believe were a mandate from the voters.	0
They said we're tired of premiums going up.	0
We're tired of deductibles going up.	0
We're tired of losing our doctors of less choices.	0
So, yes, should Congress move swiftly to repeal Obamacare?	0
Absolutely.	0
Now, nobody thinks we're done once Obamacare is repealed.	0
Once Obamacare is repealed, we need commonsense reform that increases competition, that empowers patients, that gives you more choices, that puts you in charge of your health care, rather than empowering government bureaucrats to get in the way.	0
And these have been commonsense ideas, I would note, that for six years Republicans have been proposing, and for six years Democrats have been fighting, saying no changes at all to Obamacare, even as people were hurting and losing their coverage.	0
This election is about honoring the promises we made to the people who elected us.	0
Senator Sanders?	0
Well, the truth is that the Republicans are now in a panic, because the American people have caught on that the absolute repeal of Obamacare without improvements in it, without a plan to make it better, would be an absolute disaster.	0
So when Ted talks about giving people choice, here's your choice.	0
"You got cancer, and you go to the doctor, and the insurance company says, ""We're not going to cover it."	0
We can't make money on you because you have cancer.	0
"You have a pre-existing condition."""	0
And here's another choice you can have if we get rid of Obamacare.	0
If you have diabetes, and you're spending a whole lot on health insurance, the insurance companies will say, sorry, we're only going to spend X dollars, because we've got to make money off you.	0
That's the function of private insurance.	0
So, do we have to improve the Affordable Care Act?	0
Of course we do.	0
But let us remember where we came from.	0
Before the Affordable Care Act, as Ted probably knows, if you were a family of four during the eight years under George Bush, your premiums doubled.	0
So it's not like, oh, gee, just in America today, health care costs are going up.	0
They went up much higher before we had the Affordable Care Act.	0
Senator Cruz, do you want to respond to that?	0
You know, it is interesting to hear so much of the Democratic rhetoric that government controlling your health care is always justified by saying the insurance companies are terrible.	0
Now, this is an example of what John Adams famously said, facts are stubborn things.	0
Let's talk about some facts.	0
In 2008, the 10 largest insurance companies in America made just over $8 billion profit.	0
In 2016 -- 2015, rather -- those same 10 largest companies made $15 billion in profit.	0
Insurance company profits have doubled under Obamacare.	0
That was the result.	0
Bernie helped write Obamacare.	1
I don't think the federal government ought to be passing a law that doubles insurance company profits and, while those profits were doubling, what happened to the average American family?	0
The average American family, your premiums have gone up $5,462.	0
At the same time, the average deductible has gone up $5,000.	0
For families that are struggling, you're getting less coverage, you're paying more for it, and your deductibles are higher, and you know who's making out like gangbusters?	0
The insurance companies and those in government whose solution is let's have even more government control.	0
Senator...	0
This thing isn't working.	0
Senator Sanders?	0
You know, I find myself in agreement with Ted.	0
He's right.	0
The function of insurance companies is not to provide quality health care to all people.	0
It's to make as much money as they possibly can.	0
Ted, let's work together on a Medicare for all, single-payer program, so we're finally going to get insurance companies, private insurance companies out of our lives.	0
As you know, as the American people know, we are the only major country on Earth that allows private insurance companies to run the system.	0
But it's not only the points that Ted made about the insurance companies.	0
What he forgot to tell you, even adding insult to injury, is many of these CEOs of the insurance companies make outrageous compensation and get all of these severance packages, in some cases over $100 million.	0
Ted, let's work together.	0
We're going to get those insurance companies out of health care.	0
We'll move to a Medicare for all health care program, guaranteeing health care to all people.	0
Thank you, Senators.	0
Unless you want to agree to a single- payer system...	0
Look, I would love to respond.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
You're not going to support that.	0
I know that.	0
Well, actually, what I will say, Bernie, is I would love for us to work together going after big pharma, and in particular taking on the FDA.	0
Right now, it takes $2 billion to approve a new drug.	0
Now, I've introduced legislation to reform the FDA process so that new health care -- so that we can be curing diseases and we can be helping people.	0
I would encourage you to join me in that legislation.	0
I'll tell you what...	0
Join me in right to try, so that if someone has a terminal disease, the government won't tell them, you can't try this life- saving medicine because we forbid it.	0
Gentlemen, we could do this all night.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
We're going to get to pharma.	0
I'm willing to look at it, if you are willing to look at taking on pharma, which is the greediest of many greedy corporate interests in Washington.	0
And I'll tell you what, I'm going to introduce legislation to have Medicare negotiate prices with the pharmaceutical industry.	0
I'm going to introduce, again, legislation to allow Americans to buy less expensive medicine in Canada, the U.K., and other countries.	0
Let's take on the greed of pharma, substantially lower prescription drug prices.	0
And, Dana, let me make a response to this, because this is a good discussion.	0
The whole point of having an extended discussion is to say, as you know, with drug re-importation, bringing in drugs from Canada and other countries, just a couple of weeks ago, on the Senate floor, I voted with you...	0
You voted for my amendment, that's correct.	0
... in support of that, in support of allowing drug re- importation.	0
It was the right thing to do.	0
But I'll tell you, a much bigger barrier than that is the fact that, you know, in the last 20 years, the FDA has approved only three child cancer drugs?	0
In 20 years, because the burdens are so great.	0
I introduced legislation that said if a drug is approved in another major country, if it's approved in Europe or Japan or our major respected partners, that the FDA has got 30 days to approve it here.	0
We shouldn't be telling people with life-threatening diseases you can't do everything you can to save your lives.	0
That would be a great thing.	0
Senator...	0
We'd make news if you and I joined up on that.	0
We'll need to look at it, but that is not the major problem.	0
The major problem with the pharmaceutical industry is, you know what, they could double or triple the prices you pay for medicine tomorrow...	0
Senator Sanders...	0
... and there is no legislation to control that.	0
Senator Sanders...	0
Hi, Dana, how are you?	0
Oh, hi.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
Good to see you.	0
So good to see you.	0
We do want to talk more about that later, but I want to get to some of the questions from our audience.	0
One of the most popular parts of Obamacare is -- as you mentioned earlier, requiring insurance companies to cover people with pre-existing conditions.	0
If Obamacare is repealed, 52 million Americans could lose that guaranteed coverage because of their medical histories.	0
One of them is Neosho Ponder, who is fighting breast cancer and currently undergoing radiation treatment.	0
Neosho?	0
Senator Cruz, if Obamacare is repealed, is there anything you can do to ensure that provisions are in place so that half of my paycheck won't be spent on health care?	0
I didn't ask for cancer.	0
I never smoked; I never drank a lot.	0
I lived a pretty healthy lifestyle.	0
I fear that -- I fear that if I don't have Obamacare, if I'm not covered, then my pre-existing condition of breast cancer and remaining treatments will make it difficult for me to afford insurance.	0
Senator Cruz, what can you do to protect people like me who are alive because of Obamacare?	0
Well, Neo, thank you for asking that question.	0
And how long -- how long have you been diagnosed with breast cancer?	0
I was diagnosed on April 25, 2016.	0
Wow, well, you're doing great.	0
You know, our prayers are with you.	0
I'll tell you, my mom had breast cancer, and -- and my mom was diagnosed in 2000.	0
I sat by her hospital bed as she went through two surgeries, and it's a horrible disease, but 16 years later, thank God, she is a survivor.	0
And I will tell you, our medical innovation has been incredible dealing with breast cancer.	0
So all of us -- our prayers and thoughts are with you.	0
Thank you.	0
You know, you asked about people who get sick and not wanting your insurance canceled, not wanting your premiums to go up, that's absolutely right.	0
That is absolutely right.	0
And if you look at every proposal that's been submitted, every significant proposal that's been submitted to replace Obamacare, to fix the problems in the health care system after Obamacare is gotten rid of, all of them protect people in your situations.	0
All of them prohibit insurance companies from canceling someone because they got sick.	0
They prohibit insurance companies from jacking up the insurance rates because they got sick or injured.	0
Look, the whole point of insurance is none of us know if we're going to wake up tomorrow, like you did earlier last year, and discover we have a terrible disease.	0
And we buy insurance, we pay our premiums, just so we know that we'll be able to take care of that situation.	0
So, absolutely, we've got to fix it, and I'm confident that we're going to.	0
Senator Sanders, response?	0
Senator, I cannot believe what you just said.	0
It's in direct contradiction to everything you ran for president on.	0
What Ted has said is, he wants to get rid of all federal mandates.	0
Did you say that a hundred times?	0
I didn't say it once.	0
I will -- said Ted Cruz, I will get rid of every word of Obamacare.	0
Excuse me.	0
The only way that we are going to make sure that you -- and we all wish you the best -- are able to get the health insurance you need with a pre-existing condition is to make sure that no insurance company in this country can say no to you or to anybody else.	0
Now, Ted thinks that's a terrible government intrusion.	0
I think it is the moral and right thing to do.	0
So, when you hear Ted and other Republicans say we're going to get rid of all of -- we're going to leave it to the states.	0
Well, what do you think the states are going to do?	0
You think they're going to maintain the ability to protect people with pre-existing conditions?	0
They're not.	0
We're going to go back to the obscenity of where we were before Obamacare was passed.	0
Senator Cruz, your response.	0
And then could you just clarify, will you support anything that doesn't mandate people with pre- existing conditions continue to have coverage?	0
Look, my response is, I said hundreds of times on the campaign trail, yes, we should repeal every word of Obamacare.	0
But if you listen to the next sentence, I always said, we're not done yet with health care reform, and we do that.	0
We need health care reform.	0
And the principles of health care reform, they should expand competition, they should empower patients, and they should keep government from getting between you and your doctor.	0
And I talked about all sorts of commonsense ideas to do just that.	0
And as I said, a proposal that is consistent in virtually every one of the pieces of Republican legislation that's been filed is a prohibition on insurance companies canceling people because they got sick.	0
And, you know, Bernie, it's easy to say to people, gosh, you're going to lose your coverage.	0
What do the Democrats say to the 6 million people who had their health insurance canceled?	0
What...	0
Ted, Ted, you're a good lawyer, and you use words well.	0
Thank you.	0
"What you just said is ""cancel your insurance."""	0
Cancel your insurance, OK?	0
That's good.	0
But what happens if tomorrow you wake up and you go to the doctor and you discover that you have cancer?	0
All right?	0
You just discovered it.	0
And the insurance companies say, hey, you're not a good deal for us, we can't make money off of you, you will not get that health insurance.	0
So I think when people like Ted talk about repealing Obamacare, repealing government mandates -- this is a government mandate, and it is a damn good mandate and a humane mandate.	0
And, Senator Cruz, if you would answer Neosho's specific question.	0
Yeah, I did.	0
Multiple times, Dana.	0
OK.	0
So you are saying that she will continue to have health care...	0
Yeah.	0
... she and others who have pre-existing conditions?	0
And	0
you're going to make sure that that is a mandate and a requirement in whatever legislation you support?	0
What I've said is, is virtually all of the Republican legislation that has been filed that the Democrats have opposed maintains a continuity of coverage so that insurance companies can't cancel policies.	0
And, you know, the question I asked a minute ago that Bernie chose not to answer is, what do the Democrats say to the 6 million people who had their insurance policies canceled, who got a notification in the mail that you don't get to see your doctors anymore?	0
And not just the people who were canceled.	0
There are people all over this country who can't afford health insurance because of Obamacare, who the deductibles are so high, the premiums are so high, they say, you know what, my family, we can't make it on this?	0
And, you know, you talk about the people covered by Obamacare.	0
Here's something most people don't know.	0
Most of the people covered by Obamacare are on Medicaid.	1
They jammed a bunch more people on Medicaid.	0
And I'll tell you what happens.	0
People on Medicaid have markedly worse health outcomes than people with private insurance.	0
Senator, we're going to get to these issues...	0
I would like to see a lot more people on private insurance, able to be insured for health care...	0
We're going to get to these issues of Medicaid and others....	0
... rather than -- but it's relevant to -- he's saying people are going to lose their health care.	0
If you want health care, we want as many people as possible to be able to afford insurance policies that protect you when you get sick.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
I want to just -- very briefly.	0
Go ahead.	0
If you listen carefully to what he's saying, if you go to the doctor tomorrow, and you are diagnosed with a terrible illness, the insurance companies do not have to provide you insurance.	0
That is what Ted said.	0
What he also said, if you have an illness, it has to be kept.	0
But really, we are moving into an era where millions of people who develop terrible illnesses will not be able to get insurance.	0
And God only knows how many of them will die.	0
So, Senator Sanders, you just heard Senator Cruz bring up an issue that a lot of Americans have out there, especially a lot of middle-class Americans, who say that the Affordable Care Act has made it so that their insurance is unaffordable.	0
One of them is in our audience right now.	0
Her name is Melissa Borkowski.	0
She's a nurse practitioner from Florida.	0
She is a mother of four.	0
She and her husband are paying more than $1,000 a month to insure their family for a plan with a $13,000 deductible.	0
Melissa?	0
Good evening, Senators.	0
Thank you for your time.	0
As you said, I'm a nurse practitioner.	0
I've worked in health care for over 25 years now.	0
But under Obamacare, I'm not able to get the health services I need for myself or my family.	0
Last year, I had a very abnormal pap smear and needed additional tests.	0
But our plan has a $13,000 deductible before it will cover anything, so I wasn't able to afford to get those tests done.	0
So now I sit here wondering if I have an undiagnosed cancer that will eventually take me away from my four children.	0
My plan premiums plus deductible cost over $25,000 for the year and it covers little more than basic preventative services.	0
Senator Sanders, my question is, why should we, my family, be forced to pay so much money for an insurance plan that is essentially useless and doesn't do anything for me?	0
Pam...	0
Melissa.	0
Melissa, I'm sorry.	0
Melissa, you ask a great question, and the answer is, it is totally absurd.	0
It is totally absurd.	0
But the real question we should be asking -- Melissa is talking about an outrageous deductible, right?	0
Yes.	0
So it prevents you from going to the doctor when you should be going.	0
The real question, which is never talked about or very rarely talked about, is why we end up spending as a nation twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country.	0
Now, if you were in Canada, you know what, you would get the health care that you needed.	0
If you were in the U.K., France, Germany, Scandinavia, you would get the health care you need as a right of being a citizen in this country.	0
The idea that we have policies like that, like the one you describe, is clearly an outrage and should tell every American that we've got to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all people as a right.	0
And when we do that, by the way, for a vast majority of the American people, their family incomes will go up.	0
Senator Cruz?	0
You know, Melissa, I'm sorry for the challenges you're facing.	0
There are many people in America struggling with exactly what you are, in the wreckage of Obamacare, with skyrocketing premiums, with deductibles that are unaffordable, and with really limited care.	1
And I will commend Bernie for his candor.	0
I mean, his view all along was that we need government-run and government-controlled health care for everyone.	0
And indeed, as he's said here tonight, he thinks other countries do it a lot better than America.	0
He often points to Canada, the United Kingdom, he says why do we pay more?	0
Well, there's a reason we pay more than those countries.	0
We get a lot more and a lot better health care.	0
Let me give you some basic facts.	0
As I noticed in all the Democratic primary debates, there was no discussion of the facts on the other side.	0
The United States, population controlled, delivers three times as many mammograms as Europe, two-and-a-half times the number of MRI scans, and 31 percent more C sections.	0
We provide more health care.	0
Not only that, in the United Kingdom, for example, wait times, in 2013, you waited 72 days for cataract surgery, you waited 89 days for hip replacement, 95 days for knee replacement.	0
There are 3.7 million people in the United Kingdom right now on a waiting list, waiting for health care.	0
Whenever you put government in charge of health care, what it means is they ration.	0
They decide you get care and you don't.	0
I don't think the government has any business telling you you're not entitled to receive health care.	0
That's why I think the answer is not more of Obamacare, more government control, more of what got us in this mess.	0
Rather, the answer is empower you.	0
Give you choices.	0
Lower prices.	0
Lower premiums.	0
Lower deductibles.	0
Empower you and put you back in charge of your health care.	0
Senator Cruz, thank you.	0
Senator Sanders, let me ask you, just as part of Melissa's question, Florida, the state she's from, now offers fewer insurance options through Obamacare through the insurance exchange.	0
There was a nearly 25 percent decline in the number of insurers in 2017 nationally compared to 2016.	0
There are five states that only have one insurer providing insurance on the exchange.	0
What would you do to ensure that consumers have both choice and manageable cost?	0
Fair question.	0
Let me get back to Melissa, and I'll get to you.	0
It's part of the question, because the competition is down.	0
I know it is.	0
I know it is.	0
Well, Ted talks about the problems that exist in other countries in terms of waiting lists.	0
He talks about rationing.	0
We have enormous rationing in this country.	0
When you have 28 million people who have no health insurance, that's rationing.	0
When you have people who can't afford to go to the doctor or can't afford to buy prescription drugs, one out of five Americans can't afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe, that's called rationing.	0
Except there's no rule on that; there's no law on that.	0
It's just people don't have the money to buy what they need in terms of health care.	0
To answer your question, Jake, what I have long supported within the context of Obamacare, as we move toward a Medicare for all single payer program, is a public option.	0
There should be a Medicare-type public option available in all exchanges, in all states in this country.	0
And I think that would substantially lower the cost of health care in this country and provide real competition to the private sector.	0
Senator Cruz?	0
Well, Jake, I think the question you asked is a very good one.	0
And you're right, that choices have gone down dramatically.	0
Indeed, I don't know if the cameras can see this, but in 70 percent of the counties in America, on Obamacare exchanges, you have a choice of one or two health insurance plans, that's it, 70 percent of the counties in America.	1
It's interesting.	0
You look at this map, this also very much looks like the electoral map that elected Donald Trump.	0
It's really quite striking that the communities that have been hammered by this disaster of a law said enough already.	0
Now, Bernie likes talking about a public option.	0
That's another way of saying government control of your health care.	0
It's socialized medicine.	0
And what does it mean?	0
Every country where it's been applied, you've seen rationing, you've seen government deciding, especially seniors.	0
Seniors, you don't get the health care you need.	0
Now, Bernie mentions Canada quite a bit.	0
I know quite a bit about Canadian health care.	0
I was born there.	0
You know, Bernie, that may be the best argument against your position, you know, look what it produced.	0
Look what it...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Yeah, that's right.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
But, you know, people vote with their feet.	0
In 2014, over 52,000 Canadians left Canada to get health care in the United States and other countries.	0
I'm reminded of a comment Ronald Reagan used to say about East Berlin, about the Berlin Wall.	0
He said the funny thing the leftists never seem to notice, the machine guns all point one direction.	0
Everyone was fleeing communism and coming to freedom.	0
If you look at socialized medicine, people leave there, tens and hundreds of thousands every year, leave socialized medicine countries because they want to get a hip replacement, a knee replacement.	0
You know, the governor of one of the Canadian provinces came to America to get heart surgery, and he was a governor in Canada.	0
"And, by the way, in your home state of Vermont, your hospitals advertise with Canadian flags, ""Come to American hospitals, you'll get better health care."""	0
I don't want to mess up our health care.	0
I want patients, all of us to be in charge of our health care, not government deciding what health care we get.	0
Government deciding?	0
No, government doesn't decide in Canada or anyplace else.	0
And, by the way, as you well know, Canada had for many years a conservative prime minister.	0
Conservative is relative.	0
The United Kingdom had for many, many years a conservative prime minister.	0
I don't see those countries junking their health care systems in which, by the way, poll after poll shows not that though don't have problems.	0
Of course they have problems.	0
Every health care system in the world has problems.	0
But I am not seeing those countries junking their universal health care system, which provide health care to all of their people at one half the cost per capita that we do.	0
I don't see conservative prime ministers doing that to go to the American health care system.	0
Our system is wasteful, it is dysfunctional, it is incredibly bureaucratic.	0
You talk about choice?	0
You have people who have to argue with insurance companies for days before they can get the care that they need.	0
See, Bernie, you say wasteful, and I say people exercising free choice.	0
You're right.	0
We could cut costs here if we do like Europe and cut the number of MRIs, the number of mammograms.	0
If we cut -- you know, you look at the elderly in much of Europe.	0
The elderly here, when the elderly face life-threatening diseases, they're often treated in the intensive care unit.	0
"In Europe, they're often put in palliative care, essentially doped up with some drugs, and said, ""Well, now is your time to go."""	0
Oh.	0
I don't expect the government to be saying that.	0
And let me give -- since you laughed at that, let's actually talk facts, because facts matter.	0
So let's talk about, for example, a couple of stories from the United Kingdom.	0
In Glasgow, Scotland, the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital was so overburdened this past January, it turned away three women who were in labor because they couldn't take care of them.	0
In Worchester, England, a man was left on an ambulance gurney for five hours before his heart attack was diagnosed, and he waited seven hours before he received a stent and angioplasty.	0
In a hospital in Essex, doctors twice canceled a life-saving -- potential life-saving surgery for a patient with esophageal cancer, because there were no free beds in the intensive care unit.	0
One more example.	0
In Wales, an 82-year-old woman who had fallen waited eight hours on the floor before an ambulance arrived.	0
Her daughter sat beside her in the ordeal, described it as one of the longest nights of our life.	0
This is what happened when government takes over health care -- every example on Earth -- the result is rationing and waiting periods, and you, the citizens, being told, no, you can't have the health care you want and deserve.	0
And in America, we do rationing in a different way, Ted.	0
The way we do rationing is, if you are very rich, you can get the best health care in the world, I believe, right here in the United States.	0
We should be proud of that.	0
But if you are working class, you are going to be having a very difficult time affording the outrageous cost of health care.	0
That's what Melissa just told us a moment ago.	0
Now, estimates differ, but let's be clear about this.	0
Every single year, tens of thousands of our fellow Americans die because they don't go to the doctor when they should.	0
You gave some examples about the U.K. Let me give you some examples here in the United States.	0
I talk to doctors in Vermont, all over this country, and what they tell me, patients come into their offices very, very sick.	0
And they say to the patients, why didn't you come in here a year ago when you felt your tumor, when you felt your problem, when were you sick?	0
Why didn't you come in here?	0
"And people said, ""I didn't have any insurance."""	0
"Or, ""My deductible was so high, I couldn't go."""	0
We just heard that story a moment ago.	0
And some of those people die.	0
And others end up in the hospital at outrageous costs for illnesses that could have been treated initially at far less cost.	0
So, please, don't tell me about rationing.	0
This country has more rationing than any other industrialized country on Earth, except the rationing is done by income.	0
And working-class people and poor people today are suffering as a result of that rationing.	0
We're going to take a very quick break.	0
The debate will continue right after this with Senators Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders.	0
Stay with us.	0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
Welcome back to the CNN debate on the future of health care in America, with Senators Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders.	0
Let's now turn to the effects of Obamacare on small businesses, and with us to discuss is LaRonda Hunter, who owns five hair salons in Texas.	0
LaRonda?	0
Hello.	0
Under the controls of Obamacare, my business has been restricted from expansion.	0
I'm from Fort Worth, Texas.	0
I own five Fantastic Sams hair salons.	0
We employ between 45 and 48 employees.	0
My original plan was to open more salons and employ more people.	0
However, under Obamacare, I am restricted, because I -- it requires me to furnish health insurance if I employ more than 50 people.	0
Unfortunately, the profit margin in my industry is very thin.	0
And I'm not a wealthy person, so it's impossible for me to grow my business.	0
My question to you, Senator Sanders, is how do I grow my business?	0
How do I employ more Americans without either raising the prices to my customers or lowering wages to my employees?	0
Ronda?	0
LaRonda.	0
LaRonda, OK.  You own five salons?	0
That's correct.	0
And you employ close to 50 people?	0
Just under.	0
And what kind of health insurance do you provide for them?	0
I don't -- none.	0
You provide no health insurance to them?	0
Correct.	0
Let me be -- let me give you an answer you will not be happy with, and that is I think that for businesses that employ 50 people or more, given the nature of our dysfunctional health care system right now, where most people do get their health insurance through the places that they work, I'm sorry, I think that in America today, everybody should have health care.	0
And if you have more than 50 people, you know what, I think -- I'm afraid to tell you -- I think you will have to provide health insurance.	0
So my question is, how do I do that without raising my prices to my customers or lowering wages to my employees?	0
You see, the difficulty is also is -- and I'm not much of an expert on hairdressing in general, and certainly in Fort Worth...	0
I'm just one of small businesses.	0
I know.	0
But my guess is, one of the problems that we have is there may be somebody else in Fort Worth who is providing decent health insurance to their employees, and they are in an unfair competitive situation regarding you.	0
You can compete and maybe charge lower prices, get business, while they on the other hand may be providing decent health insurance.	0
I don't think that's that...	0
I think you'll find in profit margin in my entire industry...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
I certainly don't know, you know, about hair salons in Fort Worth.	0
But I do believe, to be honest with you, that if you have more than 50 people, yes, you should be providing health insurance.	0
Senator Cruz?	0
LaRonda, thank you for sharing your story, and it's good to see	0
a fellow Texan here.	0
And, you know, I've got to say, I've got a very different view than Bernie.	0
I think actually what Bernie told you is the same thing President Obama said, it's the same thing Democrats have said, which is that you, the small business, you're apparently a bad actor, because you're not allowed to manufacture money.	0
You know, let me introduce you all to two terms that have become really common, 29ers and 49ers.	0
29ers are the millions of people across this country that have been forced into part-time work that used to have full-time employment and are now working 29 hours a week because Obamacare kicks in at 30 hours a week.	1
And a lot of them are people that are single moms, they're teenagers, they're immigrants, they're people who are struggling.	0
And then 49ers, there are millions of small businesses in the exact situation you're in.	0
You know, a couple of months ago, I was out in west Texas, was visiting a dairy farmer, driving around the dairy farm.	0
I got to say, interesting smells on the dairy farm.	0
Kind of reminds me of Washington.	0
But the farmer brought up, he said, you know how many employees I have?	0
I said, no.	0
He said I've got 49.	0
He said, do you know why I have 49?	0
And I said, yes, I do, because Obamacare kicks in at 50.	0
And he said, I could hire 20 or 30 more employees right now, but Obamacare would bankrupt my business, and that's millions of small businesses.	0
So we're here at GW.	0
Let me speak for a minute to all the young people.	0
When you come out of college with way too many student loans, my guess is you'd like to get a job.	0
And millions of small businesses being told by the Democrats, tough luck, we don't care if it drives you out of business, that's taking away opportunity and it's hurting in particular the most vulnerable.	0
It's one of the most damaging things about Obamacare.	0
Senator Sanders?	0
LaRonda, let me ask you a question.	0
What happens if one of your employees becomes ill?	0
What happens?	0
What happens if one of your employees, as happens in every part of the country, gets diabetes, gets cancer?	0
What do they do if they don't have any health insurance?	0
I can't really answer that question, but I can tell you that because the premiums have gone up so much this year and because I don't qualify for any kind of government subsidies, I don't have, for the first time in my life, insurance.	0
It's just not affordable.	0
Unfortunately, the prices of my services just don't warrant it.	0
Let me just say this, two things.	0
Number one, as I mentioned earlier, it is absolutely true that the cost of premiums are going up.	0
No argument.	0
They went up even higher during the period of George W.  Bush.	0
So it's not like, oh, gee, for the first time in American history, premiums are going up.	0
Number two, Ted mentioned part-time work, the 29ers.	0
Well, there are fewer part-time employees today than there were before Obamacare, OK?	0
So here is the point.	0
The bottom line is with -- the situation you've described is honestly absurd.	0
You should not be going around without health insurance.	0
Your employees should not be going around without health insurance.	0
We should not be spending twice as much per person on health care as do the people of any other nation.	1
Please join me and fight for a Medicare for all program.	0
Are you looking forward -- by the way, I'm not going to ask you your age -- won't do that -- but are you looking forward maybe when you get to 65 to get Medicare?	0
Would that be of help to your family?	0
I expect that that will probably happen.	0
Good.	0
Well, I certainly hope it does, and I hope Medicare is still there, despite the efforts of Senator Cruz and others, so that when you reach at least 65, you will be able to get a decent health insurance program.	0
Well, Bernie, since apparently I've now tried to kill the elderly...	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
... let me ask you a question.	0
When you heard that her premiums had skyrocketed, that she can't afford health insurance, you kind of said, well, premiums always go up.	0
I mean, let me ask you.	0
Why did President Obama look in the eyes of the American people and promise LaRonda that her health insurance premiums would go down $2,500 a year?	0
Was he telling the truth when he said that?	0
And were you and the other Democrats telling the truth when you echoed his promise to the American people?	0
Well, Ted, first thought, as everybody knows, health care is pretty complicated.	0
I think President Obama is an honest person, and I think, based on his assessment, that's what he believed.	0
Was it true?	0
But let me -- turns out not to be true, but it turns out to be that under Bush premiums went up higher.	0
Not a new thing.	0
Then the real question we should be talking about is why we do spend so much money on health care.	0
And that means that we have to appreciate that we are spending hundreds of billions of dollars every single year not on health care, but on administration and bureaucracy.	0
Do you know how much money it costs to bill you?	0
You've got people -- hundreds of people in large hospitals, they're sitting around not providing health care, they're working on paperwork, driving you crazy when you bring forth a claim.	0
So we have to figure out how we have a simple system that guarantees health care to all people.	0
When we do that, you and your employees will all have health insurance.	0
Well, there is an area actually where we agree, which is there is way too much paperwork with health care.	0
There's way too much complexity.	0
I'll tell you, when you talk to doctors, when you talk to nurses, they say, I don't get to practice health care anymore.	0
I spend all my time filling out paperwork.	0
All my time -- now, where the paperwork comes from is the government.	0
It comes from Obamacare.	0
In fact, there's some amazing stats I'm going to go back and get, because -- because they're really quite powerful.	0
If you look at the paperwork impact, Obamacare's rules alone -- and by the way, the Obamacare rules are 20,000 pages.	0
They're taller than seven feet tall.	0
They generate $51 billion in costs and more than 172 million hours of paperwork compliance.	0
And let me put that in perspective.	0
What does that mean?	0
That would take 86,200 employees, working full-time, 2,000 hours a year, to complete one year of new paperwork under Obamacare.	0
That's roughly the entire population of Miami Beach, Florida, doing nothing but filling out Obamacare forms.	0
If you want your doctor to get back to caring for you, if you want to drive down costs, get government out of the business of dictating and controlling health care.	0
Well, Ted is right.	0
There is far too much paperwork.	0
Some of it is government.	0
But you know what some of it is also?	0
It is insurance companies.	0
Every American who has filed a claim has the experience of fighting with the health insurance companies to make sure that they get what they are entitled to.	0
Doctors have to spend half of their lives arguing with the insurance companies as to whether or not they can prescribe the medicine their patients need or provide the therapy that their patients need.	0
Huge amount of waste.	0
That is why we need a simple system.	0
And, as Americans, we're going to have to make a very fundamental decision.	0
Very simple.	0
Is health care a right of all people?	0
Is it or not?	0
Ted doesn't think it is; I do think it is.	0
And then if we agree, and I think most Americans do, that it is a right, how do you provide health care to all people with high quality in a cost-effective way?	0
I happen to believe that Medicare is a popular program.	0
It works well.	0
Right now, you get it at 65.	0
I think every American should get Medicare.	0
Senator Sanders, I want to pick the discussion up right there if I may.	0
Senator Cruz...	0
Yeah, let me make a real quick point, just because I think...	0
Real quick.	0
Real quick.	0
It's nice having the back and forth and the...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
It's lovely, absolutely.	0
One thing Bernie said that I think suggests maybe an area we could work together, you were talking about paperwork from insurance companies.	0
I agree, there's way too much paperwork for insurance companies.	0
I'd like insurance companies to have less power and patients to have more power.	0
So maybe you and I could agree on a commonsense reform of allowing LaRonda to purchase health insurance of any of the 50 states.	0
Right now, she's a Texan, it's illegal for her to purchase health insurance anywhere else.	0
That would give her choice.	0
If she doesn't like what the Texas companies are offering, she can go to Oklahoma, she can go to Florida, she can go to any other state.	0
That creates a 50-state national marketplace.	0
It drives down cost.	0
It increases choices.	0
Why don't we stand together against the insurance companies and agree on that reform?	0
Well, I think standing together for a Medicare for all single-payer system is a lot better idea.	0
OK.	0
Because -- OK, because when you have the idea that Ted was talking about, this is a race to the bottom.	0
And what you are going to end up with, some insurance company in Mississippi or someplace, they're going to provide you insurance.	0
But you think your deductibles are high now?	0
It will be a lot higher.	0
Look, Ted, and you're right.	0
This is a good discussion, all right?	0
And here is the issue.	0
Ted, let me ask you a question.	0
Sure.	0
Is every American entitled -- and I underline that word -- to health care as a right of being an American?	0
Yes or no?	0
You know, I'm glad you asked that.	0
You know, right is a word you use a lot.	0
Let's talk about what rights are.	0
Rights mean you have a right for government not to mess with you, for government not to do things with you.	0
If you look at the Bill of Rights, the Bill of Rights, free speech means the government can't silence you when you're speaking.	0
Religious liberty means the government can't control who you worship, what your faith is.	0
The Second Amendment means the government can't take away your guns.	0
Those are rights.	0
You know, what the Declaration of Independence said, we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal and that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.	0
So what is a right is access to health care.	0
What is a right is choosing your own doctor.	0
And if you believe health care is a right, why on Earth did you help write Obamacare that caused six million people to have their health insurance canceled, that had them lose their doctors, and have people like LaRonda, who can't get health insurance, can't afford premiums...	1
For a start...	0
You're denying her what you say is her right.	0
Well, two things.	0
You didn't answer the question, although I interpret your question to be that LaRonda does not have a right.	0
No, that's not what I said.	0
Woah, woah, woah, I heard the Bill of Rights.	0
What I said is access to health care.	0
Access to health care is a right.	0
She has access.	0
But she doesn't have enough money.	0
And choosing your doctor is a right.	0
Look, LaRonda, you have access right now.	0
Go out and get a really great health insurance program.	0
Oh, you can't do it?	0
Because you can't afford it.	0
All right?	0
That's what he's saying.	0
Access to what?	0
You want to buy one of Donald Trump's mansions?	0
You have access to do that, as well.	0
Oh, you can't afford $5 million for a house?	0
Sorry.	0
Access doesn't mean a damn thing.	0
What it means is whether people can afford it, can get the health care that they need.	0
And they can't under Obamacare.	0
Second of all, let's -- some people have problems, no question about it.	0
I'm not arguing with you on that, Ted.	0
But don't argue with me when I tell you that 20 million more people did get health insurance, all right?	0
We used to have 48 million people in this country who had zero insurance before Obamacare.	0
Now that number, much too high, is 28 million.	0
Last point.	0
Ted talked to the young people, and he said, I want you to go out with enthusiasm, go out and go to -- get a job.	0
He's right.	0
But under Ted's ideas, if Obamacare is repealed, right now, if you're under 26, you can stay in your parents' insurance program.	0
That's one of the things we did in Obamacare.	0
Good idea.	0
Ted would repeal that.	0
So as you go out into the real world, be very careful about not having an accident.	0
Senators...	0
Because you don't have any health insurance.	0
I want to tell our audience, we're going to take a quick break.	0
We have a lot more to discuss.	0
More of CNN's debate night and the future of ae Obamacare right after this.	0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
Welcome back to the CNN health care debate with Senators Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders.	0
Senators, thanks so much for participating here.	0
I want to ask you, since Obamacare was enacted, governors of 31 states, plus the District of Columbia, have opted to expand Medicaid through federal funding, providing insurance to 11 million low income people.	0
One of the Americans who benefitted from the Obamacare Medicaid expansion is Carol Hardaway of Salisbury, Maryland.	0
Carol?	0
Thank you.	0
I have multiple sclerosis, but could not afford insurance.	0
Without the treatment or medications I need, I had problems with walking, with my speech, and my vision.	0
When the Affordable Care Act was passed, I moved from our home state of Texas -- because they refused to expand Medicaid -- to Maryland, and within two weeks, I started receiving treatments through Medicaid and am now well enough to work as a substitute teach.	0
Senator Cruz, can you promise me that you and the Republican leaders in Congress will have -- actually have a replacement plan in place for people like me who depend on their Medicaid?	0
In other words, I like my coverage.	0
Can I keep it?	0
Well, Carol, thank you for sharing your story.	0
And congratulations on dealing with MS.	0
It's a terrible disease.	0
And congratulations on your struggles dealing with it.	0
You know, if you look at Medicaid, more than half of the people who have been covered under Obamacare have been under Medicaid.	0
And the problem is:  Medicaid is a profoundly troubled program.	0
And so it may be working well with you, but I'll tell you nationally, the health outcomes under Medicaid are really poor.	1
Nationally, 54 percent of doctors won't take new Medicaid patients.	0
Nationally, dental care appointments for moms are denied at a 63 percent rate on Medicaid.	0
The denial rate for private insurance is 4 percent.	0
And Medicaid patients are almost twice as likely to die from medical treatment as those with private health insurance.	0
The solution for people who are hurting, I believe, we should have a system that allows as many people as possible to be on the private health insurance of your choice rather than Medicaid, because the Medicaid outcomes are not working and people are suffering.	0
And what's happened also -- it's really quite striking -- because Obamacare dramatically expanded Medicaid, many of the people who had been on Medicaid, many of the people who are really suffering and needy, have found their wait times increasing.	0
In fact in Illinois, on Medicaid, over 700 people have died on the waiting list for care for Medicaid.	0
So, I'm glad that you're receiving healthcare.	0
I can tell you a great many of the people on Medicaid aren't.	0
And I'd much rather see a system where we can have millions of those on Medicaid getting health insurance.	0
The only way we can is if we have competition so that rates are lower so you can afford to have health insurance.	0
Senator Sanders?	0
We heard from a woman who runs a hair salon in Ft. Worth who can't afford to provide health insurance for her workers and herself.	0
We hear a story now about a woman who has to leave her own state and go to another state because that state is providing Medicaid.	0
My friends, you are living -- I know you don't know this -- by these stories.	0
You're living in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, where the rich are becoming phenomenally richer while we have 43 million people living in poverty and the middle class is in decline.	0
These stories are obscene.	0
They should not be taking place in the United States.	0
Now, are there problems with Medicaid?	0
Of course, there are.	0
But I will tell you something, to those Republicans governors around the country who told poor people that they would not be able to, for the first time in their lives in many instances, get access to healthcare, to be able to go to a doctor when the federal government paid for the first three years at 100 percent.	0
I hope that those governors sleep well at night, because I don't know how many people lost their lives as a result of their decision.	0
So, once again, what we are looking at is a dysfunctional system.	0
We spend more, we get less.	0
People who work hard have no health insurance.	0
People have to move from one state or the other.	0
This country finally is going to have to do, in my view, what every other major country does.	0
And yes, I believe, Ted, healthcare is a human right.	0
And I believe that this country has got to join every other major country and say, you can stay home and get quality care because you're an American.	0
You can run your small business well and get care because you are an American.	0
That is where we have got to go.	0
Well, you know, when Bernie says, well, Medicaid has problems.	0
You want to talk about people who lost their rights, 742 people in Illinois were put on a waiting list for Medicaid after Illinois expanded its Medicaid, Barack Obama's home state, and they died awaiting care under Medicaid.	0
Why?	0
Because Medicaid is rationed care.	0
Those wait lists -- you know, Bernie likes to talk about medical care for all.	0
But let me be clear what his program is.	0
It's Medicaid for all.	0
It is rationed care nationally.	0
You want to know what that looks like.	0
He keeps pointing to other countries.	0
Let's look at, for example, the United Kingdom.	0
The United Kingdom, a 2001 report noted that 39 percent over 80 in the United Kingdom received surgery for breast cancer, compared to 90 percent of the women under 50.	0
And that women under -- men and women under the age of 55 were 2 1/2 times more likely than those over 75 to receive cancer treatments.	0
More than 80 percent of older patients in the United Kingdom believe they're discriminated against by their government-run healthcare.	0
You want to know what rationing looks like.	0
It looks like Medicaid.	0
It looks like the people who are suffering.	0
And if you look at this country, across this country, we have 291 million people roughly that are covered by insurance.	0
I don't think we should be screwing up the insurance of millions of Americans and putting them under rationing.	0
That's what Obamacare has moved us down the road to doing and it's not working	0
OK, Ted correctly indicates Medicaid has problems and Vermont has problems.	0
All over the country, it has problems.	0
You know what Ted's solution is?	0
Massive cuts in federal funding for Medicaid.	0
So, you've got a problem and what Ted wants to do is make it worse.	0
You mentioned dental care.	0
Maybe you want to go on my bill, which will provide dental care to tens of millions of American who can't afford it right now.	0
What we need to do, by the way, is to tell dentists out there that they may have to do more than just make you have a nice smile.	0
But they may have to provide real dental care to children and others who absolutely need it.	0
Furthermore, what we have to do is we need tens of thousands more doctors in this country.	0
We have a major crisis in primary care.	0
There are areas in urban America and in rural America where people literally can't find a doctor to serve their needs.	0
And one of the reasons, a number of reasons for that, one of them is you go to medical school, you can come out hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.	0
And then you're going to become a plastic surgeon not doing primary care in an urban area or rural America, which tells me we've got to expand the program called the National Health Service Corps so that our young people can get their debts repaid if they commit to serving in under-served areas.	0
Let's get doctors out into the areas where we need them.	0
Let me just jump in if I can.	0
Carol, you just shake your head.	0
Did Senator Cruz, your former senator, did he answer your question?	0
No, he did not.	0
The question was, Senator Cruz, can you promise me that you and the Republican leaders in Congress will actually have a replacement plan in place for people like me who depend on their Medicaid?	0
She got Medicaid through the Obamacare expansion of Medicaid.	0
We've all heard you criticize Medicaid.	0
What happens to Carol?	0
Well, what I said, Jake, is that Medicaid isn't working for millions of people and Obamacare made Medicaid worse by expanding the wait lists by jamming more people on it.	0
You want to talk about replacement, there's widespread agreement on replacement plans.	0
Number one, allowing people to purchase across state lines, giving you more choice.	0
Now, Bernie said he opposes that.	0
He doesn't want to let you buy insurance in other states.	0
Number two, expanding health savings accounts so you can save in a tax advantaged way to meet your own healthcare needs.	0
Number three, making health insurance portable so that it goes with you from job to job.	0
I imagine, ma'am, at some point, you had insurance with a job?	0
If insurance was portable right now, federal tax law incentivizes -- most of us get our insurance from the government and if you lose your -- or not from the government, from our employer rather.	0
And if you lose your job, you lose that insurance.	0
One of the best solutions to the problem of preexisting conditions is making health insurance portable that goes with you.	0
You know, when you lose your job, you don't lose your car insurance, your life insurance, your house insurance.	0
There's no reason to lose your health insurance.	0
And if your insurance is portable, it goes with you.	0
It's affordable.	0
You have choices.	0
Now, notice Bernie's solution, we want more doctors.	0
We all agree on more doctors.	0
He says, well, the government needs to hire more.	0
You know, I can point to something that works on that.	0
In Texas, we passed tort reform.	0
We fundamentally limited lawsuits and lawsuit abuse.	0
And you know what we've seen -- we've seen the number of doctors increasing dramatically.	0
We've seen medical malpractice premiums dropping.	0
Those are the kind of solutions supported at the state level that will result in more doctors.	0
But Obamacare is discouraging people from going to medical school and training to be doctors.	0
Well, Ted, I didn't want to raise it, but you brought it forth.	0
You know what state in the country -- and I don't blame you for this -- but what state in the country has the highest rate of uninsured in America by far?	0
It is the state of Texas.	0
And, by the way, may I say proudly that Vermont is number two in terms of the percentage of people who are insured.	0
We have relatively few uninsured.	0
And, by the way, amazingly enough, you know what state in the country has the highest rate of people insured?	0
It is Massachusetts with RomneyCare, which was the prototype for the Affordable Care Act.	0
Well, you know, the nice thing, Bernie, again, people vote with their feet.	0
And for north of a decade now, roughly a thousand people a day have been moving to Texas because we have an environment that allows people to get jobs.	0
And so, people vote with their feet.	0
And you're right, there are states, Vermont is a lovely state.	0
It doesn't have a ton of diversity.	0
It doesn't have nearly the populations Texas has that are populations that are just starting -- when my dad went to Texas in 1957 when he was 18, he couldn't speak English.	0
He was from Cuba.	0
He had $100 in his underwear.	0
He watched dishes making 50 cents an hour.	0
You know what?	0
He didn't have healthcare.	0
But he came to go to the University of Texas, he came to get	0
opportunity.	0
That job enabled him to get another job where he could get healthcare.	0
That's a much better solution.	0
Create an environment where you don't tax the living daylights out of people.	0
It's why people choose --	0
Senators --	0
-- to be where they get --	0
Senators --	0
Aren't we all happy that under Obama, we created 15 million new jobs in the private sector?	0
Senators, I want to get to more audience questions.	0
This one is about the fact that the Affordable Care Act requires that all insurance plans cover what the law calls essential health benefits.	0
This includes maternity and delivery costs.	0
We have a question on what will happen to that coverage for Maria Shahid Rowe, who is pregnant with her second child.	0
Maria?	0
Thank you.	0
I'm a nursing student at the Medical University of South Carolina.	0
And I'm concerned about the implications that repealing the Affordable Care Act will have on women's health and specifically for pregnant women.	0
So, I'm five months pregnant and I'm actually qualified for Medicaid due to being a full-time student.	0
My husband works for a church.	0
We live in a very modest income at the moment.	0
Senator Cruz, what policies do you have in place to protect pregnant women from losing their health coverage either due to being considered having a preexisting condition or from being charged higher insurance premiums than men?	0
Well, congratulations on your new baby.	0
Is it a boy or girl?	0
It's a surprise.	0
Oh, wonderful.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
And you said you have an older child?	0
What's your older child?	0
We have a 2-year-old son.	0
What's his name?	0
Samson.	0
Well, maybe you have Delilah and that would be --	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
Well, how wonderful and congratulations.	0
Thank you.	0
Heidi and I have two little girls at home and it is a wonderful, wonderful thing.	0
Listen, cover -- maternity coverage is incredibly important.	0
But here's how Obamacare worked -- you had a lot of politicians in Washington who said we're going to mandate every coverage on Earth.	0
And it sounds really good.	0
You know, I had a conversation a couple of years ago with a gentleman in Amarillo, Texas, who told me the story about his 101-year-old aunt who had just had her insurance cancelled.	0
And she said the reason it was cancelled was that it didn't cover maternity care.	0
Now, this fellow laughed and said, my aunt is 101 years old.	0
She doesn't really need maternity coverage right now.	0
We should have a system, I believe, where you can choose to get the policies that meet your needs.	0
And the impact, especially for young people, of all the mandated coverage -- you know, it's interesting the Democrats view -- they're big on talking about insurance coverage.	0
But it's a little bit like giving everyone a bus ticket when there are no buses.	0
What we should care about is access to healthcare, not just insurance per se.	0
And what's happened under Obamacare is that millions of people can't afford it.	0
We should be concerned about people being able to afford health insurance.	0
And that means giving them the choice in 50 states to choose a policy.	0
In your instance, you would choose a politician that had maternity coverage.	0
But someone else who right now kind of can't afford might choose a different policy.	0
Senator --	0
And when government mandates it, those choices go away.	0
Senator Sanders, your response?	0
What Ted is really telling you is that they will not guarantee coverage for you.	0
And not every pregnancy is planned and if a woman under -- a pregnant woman before Obamacare, you know what you were considered to be?	0
A preexisting condition.	0
And why would an insurance company want to provide care to you when having a baby is a fairly expensive proposition?	0
You don't make money doing that.	0
And Ted keeps talking about these mandates.	0
So, let's be clear again what Senator Cruz and his Republican friends want to do.	0
They do not want to guarantee that women who become pregnant will be able to get the healthcare and the prenatal care that they need -- which is a terrible thing, by the way, because we have one of the highest infant mortality rates in the industrialized world.	0
He says to young people who today are on their parents' program -- you're out, you're on your own after you leave college.	0
He says that if you come down with a terrible illness and you're ending up spending hundreds of thousands of dollars, your insurance company can now tell you that there is a limit to what they will pay.	0
And he is telling 20 million people who gained health insurance under Obamacare -- sorry, you're out on the streets.	0
Bottom line is: once again, the discussion, if you really think about the kind of discussion that we're having, it is an absurd discussion for the wealthiest nation in the history of the world.	0
Senator Sanders, let me follow up on that.	0
I want to respond to that briefly.	0
Please?	0
Go ahead.	0
You know, it's interesting sometimes the rhetoric that our friends on the left like to say that anyone who doesn't support government control of our healthcare somehow doesn't like and fit in whatever population you're talking about.	0
But let's again go back to facts and let's talk about young people.	0
You know, there's no group in America that's been hurt more by Obamacare than young people.	0
Young people were left on the chopping block.	0
Let's talk about some basic stats.	0
A recent study found that the Obamacare mandates, what Bernie just sang an ode to, have increased -- the three costliest mandates have increased premiums for younger people by 44 percent.	0
Without those mandates, the typical 21-year-old would pay $1,100 a year less.	0
If you're 21, think about whether it would be easier to afford healthcare if it cost $1,100 a year less.	0
And let's talk about some specifics.	0
Before Obamacare, the most affordable plan that was available for a 30-year-old Texan, for a 30- year-old Texan woman was $470 a year.	0
Today, under Obamacare, the cheapest plan that's available for a healthy 30-year-old woman in Ft. Worth is $3,236.	0
It's gone from $470 to $3,000, over $3,200.	0
That's why young people are hurting.	0
And what Obamacare did is it jacked up the rates on all the young people.	0
Why do you think there's an individual mandate?	0
It's to force young people to pay really high rates to subsidize the rest of the system.	0
And if you don't pay it, the IRS fines you.	0
And, you know, over 6 million people are fined each year by the IRS under Obamacare.	0
That's who -- (CROSSTALK)	0
Senator, we're going to get to the question of fines and so forth in a minute.	0
But I want to circle back to women's health and ask you, Senator Sanders, why should a 60-year-old male or women beyond childbearing years be required to have health insurance plans that have maternity care?	0
I don't think they should.	0
That's what Obama --	0
That's one of the things we might want to look at.	0
OK.	0
But I do believe that in the United States of America, where we talk a lot about our love for children, that pregnancy is not and should not be considered a preexisting condition.	0
That every woman in this country who gets pregnant should be 100 percent assured that she is going to get the highest quality care she needs to deliver a healthy baby.	0
Senator Cruz, I want to stay on the issue of women's health.	0
Under Obamacare, women pay nothing out-of-pocket for birth control.	0
So, will that continue under any Republican replacement?	0
It's going to be a choice for each patient to make.	0
Listen, Obamacare is all about these mandates.	0
And you know, Margaret Thatcher famously said, the problem with socialism, eventually you run out of other people's money.	0
The same is true with the mandates.	0
Every mandate, people will say, gosh, I like the -- imagine if the federal government mandated that everyone in America must drive a Lamborghini.	0
I've never driven a Lamborghini.	0
I mean, they look kind of fun.	0
But you know what?	0
I'm willing to bet most of us, if that was the mandate -- and it would be cool, you sit in a leather seat, you could go 200 miles an hour, what it would mean for most people is you couldn't afford a car?	0
If they said, but, you know, gosh, the VW Bug is not fancy enough.	0
You need everything.	0
For most people who can't afford it, it doesn't work.	0
That's what Obamacare is doing.	0
I would love for everyone to have maximum coverage on everything, but there's no magic fairy with pixie dust that gives it away for free.	0
These mandates are hurting people because it's putting people in a situation like Rolanda (ph) where they get nothing, they don't get healthcare of any kind.	0
Her employees don't get healthcare because Obamacare has driven the cost up.	0
That's why people are hurting so much under it.	0
Two points.	0
Our employees are not getting healthcare because in Texas, you did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.	0
No.	0
She has 49 employees.	0
She is not covered under it.	0
She's	0
not hiring more because --	0
Lower income people would be eligible for Medicaid.	0
Second of all, I think that it is very clear that the discussion that we're having when Ted talks about mandates, I look at it differently.	0
And also, what we should be clear about is Ted says, well, just not enough money, we can't all drive fancy cars.	0
I think it's a bit disingenuous to talk about driving a fancy car with getting access to healthcare when you're sick.	0
Last point on this issues, if we repeal the Affordable Care Act, we are going to provide $346 billion in tax breaks to the top 2 percent.	1
Ted in other ways goes even further.	0
He wants to repeal the estate tax which applies to the top 2/10 of 1 percent, the very wealthiest people in this country, and give them collectively hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks.	0
Ted, we are the wealthiest country in the world.	0
And it's not a question of everybody driving a fancy car, but it is a question to making sure that every man, woman and child in this country has healthcare as a right.	0
I want to bring back to a subject --	0
Jake, let me respond to that real quickly.	0
I know this gentleman has a question, but I want to respond --	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
-- going to talk about the estate tax.	0
What Bernie said, real quickly, I want to respond to just briefly.	0
OK.	0
Which, you know, it was interesting -- in the course of the campaign last year, encounter young people all over the country.	0
There were a lot of young people supported our campaign.	0
A lot of young people supported Bernie, and I would talk with different people supporting Bernie.	0
"And I'd say to them, typically young people, I'd say, ""You know what?"	0
"I agree with Bernie."""	0
And they sort of look at me, they'd be startled.	0
"They said, ""What are you talking about?"""	0
I said, listen, Bernie talks about how Washington is corrupt, how both parties, how both parties are in bed with big business and big money and it is a corrupt system benefitting special interests.	0
I agree absolutely and entirely.	0
And what I tell folks is where I disagree is in his solution.	0
If the problem is government is corrupt, why on earth would you want more power in Washington?	0
I want to take power out of Washington and empower the people.	0
When it comes to taxes, what I want a simple flat tax of 10 percent for everyone and abolish the IRS.	0
That ends the power of lobbyists.	0
It ends the power of Washington.	0
That's a solution empowers the people.	0
We're going to --	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
One second.	0
"In the midst of massive unprecedented income and wealth inequality, Ted's plan according to ""Wall Street Journal"" would give incredible tax breaks to top 1 percent."	0
OK, we'll do another -- we'll do another town hall debate on tax reform.	0
Good.	0
OK?	0
We're going to take a very quick break.	0
And when we come back, a subject where there might be some agreement.	0
The debate continues with Senators Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders in a moment.	0
Stay with us.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
Welcome back to the CNN debate on the future of Obamacare.	0
Let's turn now to the rise in prescription drug costs.	0
For that, I want to bring in Cole Gelrod.	0
He comes from Denver, Colorado.	0
He's a father of two whose daughter Juniper requires medication that would cost $900 a month without Medicaid.	0
Cole?	0
Thank you.	0
My 3-year-old daughter born with undiagnosed severe heart defect and required a heart transplant when she was only at 7 months old.	0
Unfortunately for us and families like ours, our employer-provided insurance does not cover the most vital of my daughter's life-saving prescriptions.	0
This luckily hasn't been unbearable financial burden for my family because of Obamacare, and particularly the Medicaid expansion.	0
Senator Cruz, regardless of what happens with health care reform, how do you plan to address the rising cost of prescription drugs?	0
Additionally, how would you like to address a healthcare insurance where companies can choose to not cover drugs that people like my daughter need to live?	0
Well, thank you for the question and thank you for the care you give to your 3-year-old daughter.	0
I know that is not easy.	0
And the question you ask is one of the great challenges facing this	0
country as we've seen the cost of drugs increasing dramatically.	0
One area Bernie and I talked about, we agree on, is allowing importation of drugs into this country from other countries where they are cheaper.	0
There's no reason why we should be subsidizing other countries across the globe.	0
But another fundamental area is FDA reform, where the costs of getting a new drug approved are prohibitively expensive.	0
"I don't know if you've ever seen, or folks have ever seen the movie ""Dallas Buyers' Club""."	0
It's a wonderful movie with Matthew McConaughey about a gentleman in Texas who had AIDS, and wanted to get drugs to care for and the FDA wouldn't allow it here and he would travel to Mexico, he traveled to Japan, he traveled all over the world trying to get life- saving drugs.	0
There are story after story after story of exactly that happening.	0
Life-saving drugs that are available, that are approved.	0
They're used in Europe.	0
They're used in Canada, and the FDA won't allow it.	0
That's why I think FDA reform is so valuable that if we lift the barriers, to let people try, give you a right to try.	0
If it's your life, you have a right to choose.	0
You have a right to try.	0
The key to it is competition.	0
Listen, the big boys, the big players like government regulation.	0
Dodd-Frank benefitted the big banks.	0
Tough FDA barriers to entry benefit the big pharmaceutical companies.	0
Massive complexity in tax laws benefits big corporations.	0
By reducing those barriers, we have competition and there's opportunity.	0
I believe we can have innovative cures.	0
To give you a sense, the four most devastating diseases in terms of human life and dollars, heart disease, Alzheimer's, diabetes and cancer.	0
We ought to be investing everything we can to cure those diseases.	0
Just curing cancer, an incredible achievement, would save $50 trillion and countless lives across the globe.	0
Thank you, Senator --	0
And the FDA is a barrier to doing that.	0
We need to change them.	0
Senator Sanders?	0
Here is the simple issue:  we pay -- just as the case with health care -- we pay by far once again the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.	0
Fifteen years ago, you know what I need?	0
I took a bus load of women, working-class women from Vermont dealing with breast cancer across the Canadian border and they were able to purchase Tamoxifen, it's a widely used breast cancer drug, at that point.	0
It's changed -- for 1/10th the price they're paying in the United States of America.	0
Tears were coming of these working class women's eyes fighting for their lives.	0
What's going on?	0
What's going on is the pharmaceutical industry owns	0
the United States Congress.	0
And in all fairness, I will admit, it's not just Republicans.	0
They have a huge influence over the Democratic Party as well.	0
So, right now, the reality is uniquely in the whole world, you can walk in tomorrow to the -- your pharmacy, the cost that you pay for medicine could be double or triple, and there's nothing anybody can do about it.	0
So, what do we have to do?	0
We have to tell the pharmaceutical industry which in 2015 made $50 billion in profit for the five major companies where the top ten executives made over $300 million in compensation, we're going to have to be very loud and clear, and say, stop ripping off the American people.	0
Two things that we can do immediately -- Ted is right.	0
I introduced and will introduce and look forward to your co-sponsorship of legislation to say that pharmacists and distributors and the American people should be able to buy FDA-approved medicine anyplace in the world.	0
That will drive down prices in this country, because then you'll have international competition.	0
Second thing we need to do, and I believe, believe it or not, I think even Donald Trump may be on board this, hard to believe, but we should be negotiating drug prices through Medicare.	0
Medicare spends zillions of dollars for medicines.	0
Right now Republicans put language in some years ago which prevents them from negotiating prices.	0
I would hope Ted will join me in saying that Medicare should be able to do what the V.A.	0
does.	0
We can lower prices as well.	0
But the bottom line here is, you've got 1,400 well-paid lobbyists right now and they are working, if I may say this, they're working against you.	0
They're working against your daughter.	0
The only thing they want is more and more profit.	0
And they could care less about the needs of the American people.	0
Well, but, Bernie, the barriers are also coming from government.	0
And I will give an example.	0
A Texas constituent Kaci Lay (ph) has a 7-year-old daughter who was put on a feeding tube when she was 7 months old.	0
And there's a drug called Domperidone that is used all across the world to treat the condition she has called gastroparesis.	0
She was put on Domperidone, this 7-month-old girl.	0
She was off the feeding tube.	0
She was living well.	0
Domperidone is available in more than 100 countries, including Canada and throughout the European Union.	0
But the FDA has been aggressively enforcing an import ban here.	0
"And I'll tell you what Kaci's mother said, ""I fear she will need to get a feeding tube again."	0
How do I tell her that?	0
"She's a little girl who has worked extremely hard to overcome her fears of eating and now her joy of just being a normal little girl will be taken away."""	0
We shouldn't have the government putting barriers to people getting the drugs they need.	0
I think that's a fair point.	0
I think if you have a product that has been deemed safe by countries that have high standards in this area, I think you make a good point.	0
But I think the more important point is that the government of the United States representing the American people has got to control the incredible greed of the pharmaceutical industry.	0
Will you join me?	0
I do appreciate you coming on board the re-importation.	0
I really do.	0
And we can win it if we got Republican support.	0
Will you stand with me in saying that Medicare which spends a huge amount of money for prescription drugs should be able to negotiate prices?	0
Oh, listen, of course, Medicare should negotiate.	0
But you and I have a different view on how you control greed.	0
Will you be on board that legislation?	0
Hold on.	0
Let me finish what I'm saying.	0
Your view -- you said before that, gosh, these executives make too much money.	0
I don't think the government should be in the business of deciding what you get paid and you get paid and you get paid.	0
And there are socialist countries on earth.	0
There are socialist countries that you encourage us to be like.	0
But those countries are not doing nearly as well as America.	0
You know, the per capita income in America is over five times the average per capita income in this world.	0
It's 50 percent more than the per capita income in Europe.	0
This is a land of opportunity because there is social mobility.	0
In socialist countries, if you are born poor, you usually stay poor.	0
The advantage of this country, someone can start out a dishwasher like my dad did and the free enterprise system in this country lets people rise.	0
So, I don't think the answer is government putting wage and price controls in and deciding --	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Senator Sanders --	0
The point was that millions of Americans can't afford the medicine while the drug companies are making incredible profits and paying their CEOs obscene compensation packages.	0
Yes, that does concern me.	0
In terms of socialist countries, you think Denmark and Sweden and Finland are terrible places to live.	0
I think they do pretty well --	0
I choose to live in America.	0
Senator Sanders, let's get back to America and to the Affordable Care Act.	0
Throughout your campaign, you said that taxes should go up on the	0
rich, not the middle class.	0
And yet, millions of Americans who chose not to get health care are forced to pay a tax penalty.	0
So, families of four are paying up to $2,000 per year for failing to purchase coverage.	0
Many say that they can't afford the premiums, so it's just cheaper for them to pay the penalty than get health care.	0
So, is it fair to put this tax burden on families?	0
No.	0
It's not.	0
But on the other hand, is it fair to not raise the revenue that we need to provide the kinds of benefits that we are providing?	0
That is a way to do it.	0
I don't think it's a particularly good way.	0
"I disagree with Ted, who wants to give, according to the ""Wall Street Journal"" and many other publications, incredible tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires."	0
I think in the wealthiest country in the world, we should raise funds in a progressive way, where the very rich are now doing phenomenally well -- yes, I do believe they should be asked to pay more in taxes and I think we should use that money and other mechanisms to provide health care to all people.	0
Senator, on that very topic, the top 1 percent are paying a lot more in taxes under Obamacare.	0
But if you repeal it, will the top 1 percent, the wealthiest Americans effectively get a tax cut?	0
Well, Dana, let me point out that Bernie acknowledged that 6.5 million Americans are paying Obamacare tax fines because they can't afford insurance.	0
So, they can't afford health insurance and then the IRS comes in and fines them.	0
He says, gosh, I don't agree with that.	0
And yet, throughout the Democratic debate, Bernie says he helped write Obamacare that imposes these fines on people.	0
I think it's wrong to be fining people.	0
But let me make a broader point on taxes.	0
Many times in this debate, Bernie has talked about providing health care for free from the government.	0
You know what?	0
The simplest principle in economics is TANSTAAFL, there ain't no such thing as a free lunch.	0
The liberal-leaning Urban Institute scored Bernie's health plan, concluded it would cost $2.5 trillion in the first year and $32 trillion over ten years.	0
Now, how much that is?	0
Trillions, it's a big number.	0
It's not clear what that is.	0
Let me put it in perspective.	0
All of the federal income taxes we pay today are about $1.5 trillion a year.	0
$2.5 trillion means every one of us paying income taxes would have to about triple what you pay in income taxes to get an additional $2.5 trillion.	0
Now, Bernie no doubt is going to come back and say, no, no, no, none of you are going to pay.	0
Just the rich.	0
Well, how about if we took every person that makes over $1 million a	0
year and confiscated 100 percent of their income, took every penny that they make.	0
That would raise only enough money to fund Bernie's plan for five months.	0
Here's another idea.	0
How about if the government confiscated the assets of Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook and ExxonMobil, if it came in, illegally seized those companies and sold them, that would pay for one year of Bernie's plan.	0
If you don't want to see your taxes triple in addition to the wait lists, in addition to the rationing, in addition to fewer MRIs and mammograms to worse care, then you don't want to see Bernie's Medicaid for all.	0
You want to see cheap, affordable health care that you can choose that puts you in control.	0
"Quote, ""Wall Street Journal"", October 29th, 2015."	0
"Ted Cruz's -- Wall Street Journal,"" not my paper, your paper, maybe."	0
Oh, no.	0
Ted Cruz's new tax plan delivers its biggest benefits to the top 1 percent of U.S. households, adding about one-third to their after-tax income.	0
Here is the economic reality facing America.	0
In the last 35 years, there has been a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class and the working class to the top one-tenth of 1 percent.	0
We are talking about trillions of dollars.	0
Ted's response to that is he's going to support the repeal of the estate tax, correct?	0
You're on record in doing that.	0
Among many things.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Among many other breaks to billionaires.	0
I don't want to bankrupt small business owners.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
The only people who pay the estate tax are the top two- tenths of 1 percent.	0
It would cost us over $200 billion.	0
And as Ted said, it goes on and on and on.	0
So, this right wing hyperbole of we can confiscate everybody -- it's not going to do anything.	0
Here's the basic point: if we pass the Sanders plan, 95 percent of people in this country would have more after-tax income than they have right now.	0
Senators, I'm sorry.	0
It's clear we have a lot more to debate and we can do that at a later time but we have to take a break.	0
And when we come back, closing statements about health carry.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Now it's time for closing statements.	0
Each senator will get two minutes.	0
We're going to begin with Senator Bernie Sanders.	0
Senator?	0
Well, let me thank Ted for being here.	0
Let me thank CNN for sponsoring this debate which I thought has been a very interesting discussion.	0
As I see it, the great political problem that we face right now is that we have a Congress that is more interested in representing their campaign contributors and the very wealthy than the needs of ordinary Americans.	0
Ted ran a very vigorous campaign for president.	0
I congratulate him.	0
But Ted also received $36 million in their campaign from three billionaires, three billionaires.	0
And as a result of Citizens United, we are now looking at the Koch brothers, the second wealthiest family in America, and other billionaires literally buying elections.	0
And that translates into health care policy because the end result is that Congress worries more about the insurance industry and the pharmaceutical industry and the medical equipment suppliers than they do about the needs of the American people.	0
If you listen closely to the very fine questions that people here asked tonight, and you take a step backward, you say whoa, what kind of craziness is this?	0
We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world and yet we have tens and tens and tens of millions of people struggling with prescription drugs, struggling with basic health care.	0
Yes, we can do better than that.	0
And then on top of all of that, we end up spending almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country.	0
Now, what Ted is proposing is to make a difficult situation even worse.	0
To my mind, Obamacare is a step forward.	0
We have got to go further.	0
But what Ted wants to do is do away with many of the patient protection bills, provisions, that were passed, pre-existing conditions, a cap on what you have to pay, making sure that women are not discriminated against, making sure that young people can stay on their parents' insurance programs.	0
Under Ted's idea, all of that is gone.	0
You are on your own.	0
I think that is a very bad idea.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Senator Cruz?	0
I want to thank Bernie for being here and for being a vigorous and honest debater.	0
He believes what he believes and he represents it well.	0
And I want to thank each much you for spending so much time addressing this critically important issue.	0
You know, I'd like to take a minute and ask the people if the cameras could turn for a moment to the folks in the audience, I want to ask you how many of you here in the last six years have seen your health insurance premiums or your deductibles go up?	0
Let me ask another question.	0
How many of you here know somebody including yourself who has had your insurance policy canceled in the last six years?	0
If you look at these hands across the room, this is why people are so unhappy with Obamacare, because it isn't working, because it was built on an edifice of lies.	0
When politicians promise the American people, if you like your plan, you can keep your plan, if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor, and 6 million people get their plans canceled against their wishes, those are broken promises.	0
When the president of the United States promises your premiums will drop $2,500 and instead, the average premium rises $5,000 and deductibles go up $5,000, people are hurting because of Obamacare.	0
"And Bernie's solution -- you know, I'm reminded of an old ""Saturday Night Live"" skit with Christopher Walken where they are playing in a band and he keeps ringing the cow bell."	0
And every team they recorded his solution is more cow bell, more cow bell.	0
It was government control that messed this all up.	0
And Bernie and the Democrats' solution is more cow bell, more cow bell.	0
Yes, it didn't work when we said you wouldn't get your plan canceled.	0
Yes, it didn't work when we said your premiums would be cut.	0
But give government even more power.	0
We can do better.	0
I believe we are going to honor the promises we made to the American people and we are going to repeal what Bill Clinton called Obamacare the craziest law in the world.	0
Instead, we're going to give you choice, let you buy insurance across state lines, expand health savings accounts, make insurance portable, block grant Medicaid to the states so you can have experimentation, health savings accounts so we can meet your need, put you in charge of your health care with your doctor, not government.	0
That's what this election was about, and now, it is incumbent on all of us, Republicans and Democrats, to deliver on the promises made to the American people.	0
Our thanks to Senator Cruz and Senator Sanders for joining us here tonight.	0
And we also want to thank our audience here, our hosts at my alma mater, the George Washington University.	0
Welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate candidates.	0
We’re about to begin opening statements.	0
But first, a review of the ground rules that your campaigns agreed to earlier this month to ensure a fair debate.	0
As moderators, we will attempt to guide the discussion.	0
You will each receive one minute to answer questions, 30 seconds for responses and rebuttals and 15 additional seconds if a moderator asks for a clarification.	0
The timing lights will remind you of these limits.	0
Please respect that and please refrain from interrupting your fellow candidates during their allotted time.	0
A candidate infringing on another candidate's time will have his or her time reduced.	0
We also want to ask our audience inside the historic Fox Theater to remain silent when the candidates are actively debating.	0
The candidates need to be able to hear the questions and hear one another.	0
Time, now, for opening statements.	0
You'll each receive one minute.	0
Governor Steve Bullock, please begin.	0
Thanks, Dana,	0
I come from a state where a lot of people voted for Donald Trump.	0
Let's not kid ourselves.	0
He will be hard to beat.	0
Yet watching that last debate, folks seemed more concerned about scoring points or outdoing each other with wish-list economics, than making sure Americans know we hear their voices and will help their lives.	0
Look, I'm a pro-choice, pro-union, populist Democrat who won three elections in a red state. Not by compromising our values, but by getting stuff done. That's how we win back the places we lost: showing up, listening, focusing on the challenges of everyday Americans.	0
That farmer getting hit right now by Trump's trade wars, that teacher working a second job, just to afford her insulin.	0
They can't wait for a revolution.	0
Their problems are in the here and now.	0
I’m a progressive, emphasis on progress, and I’m running for president to get stuff done for all those Americans Washington has left behind.	0
Marianne Williamson?	0
Thank you.	0
In 1776 our founders brought forth on this planet an extraordinary new possibility.	0
It was the idea that people, no matter who they were, would simply have the possibility of thriving.	0
We have not ever totally actualized this ideal.	0
But at the times when we have done best, we have tried.	0
And when forces have opposed them, generations of Americans have risen up and pushed back against those forces.	0
We did that with abolition and with women's suffrage and with civil rights.	0
And now it is time for a generation of Americans to rise up again, for an amoral economic system has turned short-term profits for huge multi-national corporations into a false god.	0
And this new false god takes precedence over the safety and the health and the well-being of we the American people and the people of the world and the planet on which we live.	0
Conventional politics will not solve this problem because conventional politics is part of the problem.	0
We the American people must rise up and do what we do best and create a new possibility, say no to what we don't want and yes to what we know can be true.	0
I'm Marianne Williamson, and that's why I'm running for president.	0
Congressman John Delaney?	0
Folks, we have a choice.	0
We can go down the road that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren want to take us, which is with bad policies like Medicare for all, free everything and impossible promises that will turn off independent voters and get Trump re-elected.	0
That’s what happened with McGovern.	0
That’s what happened with Mondale.	0
That’s what happened with Dukakis.	0
Or we can nominate someone with new ideas to create universal health care for every American with choice, someone who wants to unify our country and grow the economy and create jobs everywhere.	0
And then we win the White House.	0
I'm the product of the American dream.	0
I believe in it.	0
I'm the grandson of immigrants, the son of a construction worker.	0
My wife April and I have four amazing daughters.	0
I was the youngest CEO in the history of the New York Stock Exchange, created thousands of jobs and then served in Congress.	0
That's the type of background -- and my platform is about real solutions, not impossible promises, that can beat Trump and govern.	0
Thank you.	0
Congressman Tim Ryan?	0
America is great, but not everyone can access America's greatness.	0
The systems that were built to lift us up are now suffocating the American people.	0
The economic system that used to create $30, $40, $50 an hour jobs that you can have a good, solid middle-class living now force us to have two or three jobs just to get by.	0
Most families, when they go to sit at the kitchen table to do their bills, they get a pit in the middle of their stomach.	0
We deserve better.	0
And the political system is broken, too, because the entire conversation is about left or right, where are you at on the political system?	0
And I'm here to say this isn't about left or right.	0
This is about new and better.	0
And it's not about reforming old systems.	0
It's about building new systems.	0
And tonight, I will offer solutions that are bold, that are realistic and that are a clean break from the past.	0
Governor John Hickenlooper?	0
Last year Democrats flipped 40 Republican seats in the House, and not one of those 40 Democrats supported the policies of our front-runners at center stage.	0
Now, I share their progressive values, but I'm a little more pragmatic.	0
I was out of work for two whole years until I started what became the largest brew pub in America.	0
And I learned the small -- small business lessons of how to provide service and teamwork and became a top mayor, and as governor of Colorado created the number one economy in the country.	0
We also expanded health care and reproductive rights.	0
We attacked climate change head-on.	0
We beat the NRA.	0
We did not build massive government expansions.	0
Now, some will promise a bill tonight or a plan for tonight.	0
What we focused on was making sure that we got people together to get things done, to provide solutions to problems, to make sure that we -- that we worked together and created jobs.	0
That's how we're going to beat Donald Trump.	0
That's how we're going to win Michigan and the country.	0
Senator Amy Klobuchar?	0
Let's get real.	0
Tonight we debate, but ultimately, we have to beat Donald Trump.	0
My background, it's a little different than his.	0
I stand before you today as a granddaughter of an iron ore miner, as a daughter of a union teacher and a newspaper man, as the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from the state of Minnesota and a candidate for president of the United States.	0
That's because we come from a country of shared dreams, and I have had it with the racist attacks.	0
I have had it with a president that says one thing on TV that has your back and then you get home and you see those charges for prescription drugs and cable and college.	0
You're going to hear a lot of promises up here, but I'm going to tell you this.	0
Yes, I have bold ideas, but they are grounded in reality.	0
And, yes, I will make some simple promises.	0
I can win this.	0
I'm from the Midwest.	0
And I have won every race, every place, every time.	0
And I will govern with integrity, the integrity worthy of the extraordinary people of this nation.	0
Congressman Beto O'Rourke?	0
I'm running for president because I believe that America discovers its greatness at its moments of greatest need.	0
This moment will define us forever, and I believe that in this test America will be redeemed.	0
In the face of cruelty and fear from a lawless president, we will choose to be the nation that stands up for the human rights of everyone, for the rule of law for everyone, and a democracy that serves everyone.	0
Whatever our differences, we know that, before we are anything else, we are Americans first, and we will ensure that each one of us is well enough and educated enough and paid enough to realize our full potential.	0
We will meet these challenges here at home, and we will lead the world in those that we face abroad, successfully confronting endless war and climate change.	0
At this moment of truth, let us pursue our national promise and make a more perfect union of everyone, by everyone, and for everyone.	0
Mayor Pete Buttigieg?	0
I'm running for president because our country is running out of time.	0
It is even bigger than the emergency of the Trump presidency.	0
Ask yourself how somebody like Donald Trump ever gets within cheating distance of the Oval Office in the first place.	0
It doesn't happen unless America is already in a crisis -- an economy that's not working for everyone, endless war, climate change.	0
We have lived this in my industrial Midwestern hometown.	0
My generation has lived this as long as we have been alive.	0
And it’s only accelerating.	0
Science tells us we have 12 years before we reach the horizon of catastrophe when it comes to our climate.	0
By 2030, the average house in this country will cost half a million bucks and a women’s right to choose may not even exist.	0
We are not going to be able to meet this moment by recycling the same arguments, policies, and politicians that have dominated Washington for as long as I have been alive.	0
We've got to summon the courage to walk away from the past and do something different.	0
This is our shot.	0
That is why I'm running for president.	0
Senator Elizabeth Warren?	0
Donald Trump disgraces the office of president every single day.	0
And anyone on this stage tonight or tomorrow night would be a far better president.	0
I promise, no matter who our candidate is, I will work my heart out to beat Donald Trump and to elect a Democratic Congress.	0
But our problems didn't start with Donald Trump.	0
Donald Trump is part of a corrupt, rigged system that has helped the wealthy and the well-connected and kicked dirt in the faces of everyone else.	0
We're not going to solve the urgent problems that we face with small ideas and spinelessness.	0
We're going to solve them by being the Democratic Party of big structural change.	0
We need to be the party that fights for our democracy and our economy to work for everyone.	0
You know, I know what's broken in this country, I know how to fix it, and I will fight to make it happen.	0
Senator Bernie Sanders?	0
Tonight in America, as we speak, 87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured, but the health care industry made $100 billion in profits last year.	0
Tonight, as we speak, right now, 500,000 Americans are sleeping out on the street, and yet companies like Amazon that made billions in profits did not pay one nickel in federal income tax.	0
Tonight, half of the American people are living paycheck to paycheck, and yet 49 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent.	0
Tonight, the fossil fuel industry continues to receive hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks while they destroy this planet.	0
We have got to take on Trump’s racism, his sexism, xenophobia and come together in an unprecedented grassroots movement, to not only defeat Trump but to transform our economy and our government.	0
Thank you, Senator Sanders.	0
Let's start the debate with the number-one issue for Democratic voters, health care.	0
And Senator Sanders, let's start with you.	0
You support Medicare for all, which would eventually take private health insurance away from more than 150 million Americans, in exchange for government-sponsored health care for everyone.	0
Congressman Delaney just referred to it as bad policy.	0
"And previously, he has called the idea ""political suicide that will just get President Trump re-elected."""	0
What do you say to Congressman Delaney?	0
You're wrong.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
Right now, we have a dysfunctional health care system	1
87 million uninsured or underinsured, $500,000 -- 500,000 Americans every year, going bankrupt because of medical bills, 30,000 people dying while the health care industry makes tens of billions of dollars in profit.	1
Five minutes away from me and John is a country, it's called Canada.	0
They guarantee health care to every man, woman and child as a human right.	0
They spend half of what we spend.	0
And by the way, when you end up in a hospital in Canada, you come out with no bill at all.	0
Health care is a human right, not a privilege.	0
I believe that, I will fight for that.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Senator Sanders.	0
Congressman Delaney?	0
Well, I'm right about this.	0
We can create a universal health care system to give everyone basic health care for free, and I have a proposal to do it.	0
But we don't have to go around and be the party of subtraction, and telling half the country, who has private health insurance, that their health insurance is illegal.	0
My dad, the union electrician, loved the health care he got from the IBEW.	0
He would never want someone to take that away.	0
Half of Medicare beneficiaries now have Medicare Advantage, which is private insurance, or supplemental plans.	0
It's also bad policy.	0
It'll underfund the industry, many hospitals will close...	0
Thank you, Congressman.	0
... and it's bad policy.	0
Senator Sanders, I want to -- I...	0
My name was also mentioned in this.	0
We're going to come to you in one second, but let me go to Senator Sanders right now.	0
Senator Sanders?	0
The fact of the matter is, tens of millions of people lose their health insurance every single year when they change jobs or their employer changes that insurance.	0
If you want stability in the health care system, if you want a system which gives you freedom of choice with regard to a doctor or a hospital, which is a system which will not bankrupt you, the answer is to get rid of the profiteering of the drug companies...	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
... and the insurance companies, move to Medicare for all.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Congressman Delaney?	0
But now he’s talking about a different issue.	0
What I’m talking about is really simple.	0
We should deal with the tragedy of the uninsured and give everyone health care as a right.	0
But why do we got to be the party of taking something away from people?	0
No.	0
No one is the party...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Hold on one second, Senator.	0
That's what they're running on.	0
They're running on...	0
No.	0
... telling half the country that your health insurance is illegal.	0
It says it right in the bill.	0
All right, thank you.	0
We don't have to do that.	0
We can give everyone health care...	0
OK.	0
... and allow people to have choice.	0
That's the American way.	0
Thank you, Congressman.	0
Senator Warren?	0
So, look.	0
Let's -- let's be clear about this.	0
We are the Democrats.	0
We are not about trying to take away health care from anyone.	0
That's what the Republicans are trying to do.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And we should stop using Republican talking points in order to talk with each other about how to best provide that health care.	0
Now, I want to have a chance to tell the story about my friend Ady Barkan.	0
Ady is 35 years old.	0
He has a wife, Rachael, he has a cute little boy named Carl.	0
He also has ALS and it's killing him.	0
Ady has health insurance, good health insurance...	0
Senator?	0
... and it's not nearly enough.	0
Senator?	0
I want to -- I'm coming right...	0
No, this is important.	0
...	0
I'm staying with you, I'm staying with you.	0
But you exceeded your time.	0
So let me just stay with you on Medicare for all.	0
All right.	0
At the last debate, you said you’re, quote, “with Bernie on Medicare for all.” Now, Senator Sanders has said that people in the middle class will pay more in taxes to help pay for Medicare for all, though that will be offset by the elimination of insurance premiums and other costs.	0
Are you also, quote, “with Bernie” on Medicare for all when it comes to raising taxes on middle-class Americans to pay for it?	0
So giant corporations and billionaires are going to pay more.	0
Middle-class families are going to pay less out of pocket for their health care.	0
And I'd like to finish talking about Ady, the guy who has ALS...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
This isn’t funny.	0
This is somebody who has health insurance and is dying.	0
And every month, he has about $9,000 in medical bills that his insurance company won’t cover.	0
His wife, Rachael, is on the phone for hours and hours and hours, begging the insurance company, “Please cover what the doctors say he needs.”	0
He talks about what it's like to go online with thousands of other people to beg friends, family, and strangers for money so he can cover his medical expenses.	0
The basic profit model of an insurance company is taking as much money as you can in premiums and pay out as little as possible in health care coverage.	0
That is not working for Americans...	0
Thank you.	0
... across this country...	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Medicare for All will fix that, and that's why I'll fight for it.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Just a point of clarification...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... in 15 extra seconds, would you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for All, offset, obviously, by the elimination of insurance premiums, yes or no?	0
Costs will go up for billionaires and go up for corporations.	0
For middle-class families, costs -- total costs -- will go down.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Governor Bullock, I want to bring you in.	0
You do not support Medicare for All.	0
How do you respond to Senator Warren?	0
No, health care is so personal to all of us.	0
Never forget when my 12-year-old son had a heart attack within 24 hours of his life.	0
Had to be life-flighted to Salt Lake City.	0
But because we had good insurance, he's here with me tonight.	0
At the end of the day, I'm not going to support any plan that rips away quality health care from individuals.	0
This is an example of wish list economics.	0
It used to be just Republicans who wanted to repeal and replace.	0
Now many Democrats do, as well.	0
We can get there with a public option, negotiating drug prices, ending...	0
Thank you, Governor Bullock.	0
I want to bring in Mayor Buttigieg.	0
On the topic of whether or not the middle class should pay higher taxes in exchange for guaranteed health care and the elimination of insurance premiums, how do you respond, Mayor?	0
So we don't have to stand up here speculating about whether the public option will be better or a Medicare for All environment will be better than the corporate options.	0
We can put it to the test.	0
That's the concept of my Medicare for All Who Want It proposal.	0
That way, if people like me are right that the public alternative is going to be not only more comprehensive, but more affordable than any of the corporate options around there, we'll see Americans walk away from the corporate options into that Medicare option, and it will become Medicare for All without us having to kick anybody off their insurance.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Just 15 seconds on the clarification.	0
You are willing to raise taxes on middle-class Americans in order to have universal coverage with the disappearance of insurance premiums, yes or no?	0
I think you can buy into it.	0
That's the idea of Medicare for All Who Want It.	0
Look, this is a distinction without a difference, whether you're paying the same money in the form of taxes or premiums.	0
Look, in this country, if you have health coverage -- if you don't have health coverage, you're paying too much for care, and if you do have health coverage, you're paying too much for care.	0
Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.	0
I want to bring in Congressman O'Rourke on the topic of whether the middle class should pay higher taxes in exchange for universal coverage and the elimination of insurance premiums.	0
What's your response?	0
The answer is no.	0
The middle class will not pay more in taxes in order to ensure that every American is guaranteed world-class health care.	0
I think we're being offered a false choice, some who want to improve the Affordable Care Act at the margins, others who want a Medicare for All program that will force people off of private insurance, I have a better path.	0
Medicare for America.	0
Everyone who is uninsured is enrolled in Medicare tomorrow.	0
Those who are insufficiently insured are enrolled...	0
Congressman...	0
... in Medicare...	0
Just a 15 seconds...	0
And those who have employer-sponsored insurance...	0
Who is offering -- who is offering a false choice here?	0
Jake, this is important.	0
Who's offering a false choice here?	0
You have some.	0
Governor Bullock, who’s said that we will improve the Affordable Care Act at the margins with a public option.	0
You have others to my right who are talking about taking away people’s choice for the private insurance they have or members of unions.	0
I was listening to Dee Taylor in Nevada...	0
Thank you, Congressman.	0
Governor Bullock...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
... he just said you're offering a false choice, sir.	0
Congressman, not at all.	0
You know, it took us decades and false starts to get the Affordable Care Act.	0
So let's actually build on it.	0
A public option, allowing anyone to buy in.	0
You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any place actually in the world.	0
We got nothing to show for it.	0
Negotiate prescription drug prices.	0
End surprise medical billing.	0
That's the way that we can get there without disrupting the lives of 160 million people that like their employer-sponsored health insurance.	0
Congressman O’Rourke, you can respond.	0
Congressman O’Rourke, you can respond.	0
Every estimate that I've seen of expanding ACA even through a public option still leaves millions of people uninsured and also means that people are not guaranteed the health care that they need, as the example that Senator Warren showed us.	0
Our plan ensures that everyone is enrolled in Medicare or can keep their employer-sponsored insurance.	0
When we listen to the American people -- and this is what they want us to do -- they want everyone covered, but they want to be able to maintain choice...	0
Thank you, Congressman.	0
... and our plan does that.	0
Thank you, Congressman.	0
I want to bring in Senator Klobuchar.	0
Senator Warren at the beginning of the night said that Democrats cannot bring -- cannot win the White House with small ideas and spinelessness.	0
In the last debate, she said the politicians who are not supporting Medicare for All simply lack the will to fight for it.	0
You do not support Medicare for All.	0
Is Senator Warren correct?	0
Do you just not lack the will to fight for it?	0
That is incorrect.	0
I just have a better way to do this.	0
And in one of my first debates, Jake, I was called a street fighter from the iron range by my opponent.	0
And when she said it, I said thank you.	0
So this is what I think we need to get done.	0
We need the public option.	0
That's what Barack Obama wanted, and it would bring health care costs down for everyone.	0
And by the way, I just don't buy this.	0
I've heard some of these candidates say that it's somehow not moral if you -- not moral to not have that public option.	0
Well, Senator Sanders was actually on a public option bill last year, and that was, Bernie, the Medicaid public option bill that Senator Schatz introduced.	0
Clearly, this is the easiest way to move forward quickly, and I want to get things done.	0
People can't wait.	0
I've got my friend, Nicole, out there whose son was actually died trying to ration his insulin as a restaurant manager.	0
And he died because he didn't have enough money to pay for it.	0
Senator...	0
Jake.	0
And Bernie and I have worked on pharmaceutical issues together.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
We can get less expensive drugs.	0
Senator Sanders -- I'm going to go to Senator Sanders, then Senator Warren, because you both were mentioned.	0
Senator Sanders?	0
As the author -- as the author of the Medicare bill, let me clear up one thing.	0
As people talk about having insurance, there are millions of people who have insurance, they can't go to the doctor, and when they come out of the hospital, they go bankrupt.	0
All right?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
What I am talking about and others up here are talking about is no deductibles and no co-payments.	0
And, Jake, your question is a Republican talking point.	0
At the end of the day...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And by the way -- and by the way -- by the way -- the health care industry will be advertising tonight on this program.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Senator Warren, it's your turn.	0
Oh, can I complete that, please?	0
Your time is up.	0
Thirty seconds.	0
They will be advertising tonight with that talking point.	0
Senator Warren?	0
So we have to think of this in terms of the big frame.	0
What's the problem in Washington?	0
It works great for the wealthy.	0
It works great for those who can hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers.	0
And it keeps working great for the insurance companies and the drug companies.	0
What it's going to take is real courage to fight back against them.	0
These insurance companies do not have a God-given right to make $23 billion in profits and suck it out of our health care system.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
They do not have a God-given right...	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
On page eight of the bill it says...	0
... to put...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
I want to let Congressman Delaney in.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
If we could all just stick to the rules of the time, that would be great.	0
Congressman Delaney?	0
So I was -- I'm the only one on this stage who actually has experience in the health care business.	0
And with all due respect, I don't think my colleagues understand the business.	0
We have the public option, which is great.	0
It's not a business!	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
The public option is great, but it doesn't go far enough.	0
It doesn't go far enough.	0
I'm proposing universal health care, where everyone gets health care as a basic human right for free, but they have choices.	0
My plan, BetterCare, is fully paid for without raising middle class tax options.	0
So when we think about this debate...	0
Thank you, Congressman.	0
There's Medicare for All, which is extreme...	0
Thank you, Congressman.	0
I was interrupted.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
I want to bring in -- I want to bring in Governor Hickenlooper.	0
Governor Hickenlooper, I'd like to hear what you say about Senator Warren's suggestion that those people on the stage who are not in favor of Medicare for All lack the political will to fight for it.	0
Well, obviously, I disagree with that as much as I respect both of the senators to my right.	0
You know, it comes down to that question of Americans being used to being able to make choices, to have the right to make a decision.	0
And I think proposing a public option that allows some form of Medicare that maybe is a combination of Medicare Advantage and Medicare, but people choose it, and if enough people choose it, it expands, the quality improves, the cost comes down, more people choose it, eventually, in 15 years, you could get there, but it would be an evolution, not a revolution.	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
Senator Warren?	0
You know...	0
Jake?	0
... we have tried this experiment with the insurance companies.	0
And what they've done is they've sucked billions of dollars out of our health care system.	0
And they force people to have to fight to try to get the health care coverage that their doctors and nurses say that they need.	0
Why does everybody -- why does every doctor, why does every hospital have to fill out so many complicated forms?	0
It's because it gives insurance companies a chance to say no and to push that cost back on the patients.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Senator Warren.	0
That's what we have to fight.	0
I want to bring in Marianne Williamson.	0
Ms. Williamson, how do you respond to the criticism from Senator Warren that you’re not willing to fight for Medicare for All?	0
I don't know if Senator Warren said that about me specifically.	0
I admire very much what Senator Warren has said and what Bernie has said.	0
But I have to say, I have -- I'm normally way over there with Bernie and Elizabeth on this one.	0
I hear the others.	0
And I have some concern about that, as well.	0
And I do have concern about what the Republicans would say.	0
And that's not just a Republican talking point.	0
I do have concern that it will be difficult.	0
I have concern that it will make it harder to win, and I have a concern that it'll make it harder to govern.	0
Because if that's our big fight, then --	0
Thank you Ms. Williamson.	0
The Republicans will so shut us down on everything else.	0
I want to bring in Mayor Buttigieg -- Mayor Buttigieg, your response?	0
It is time to stop worrying about what the Republicans will say.	0
Look, if --	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
If it's true that if we embrace a far-left agenda they're going to say we're a bunch of crazy socialists.	0
If we embrace a conservative agenda, you know what they're going to do?	0
They're going to say we're a bunch of crazy socialists.	0
So let's just stand up for the right policy, go out there and defend it.	0
That's the policy I'm putting forward, not because I think it's the right triangulation between Republicans here and Democrats there -- because I think it's the right answer for people like my mother-in-law who is here -- whose life was saved by the ACA, but who is still far too vulnerable to the fact that the insurance industry does not care about her --	0
Thank you Mayor Buttigieg, Senator Sanders your response?	0
Let's be clear what this debate is about.	0
Nobody can defend the dysfunctionality of the current system.	0
What we are taking on is the fact that over the last 20 years the drug companies and the insurance companies have spent $4.5 billion of your health insurance money on lobbying and campaign contributions.	0
That is why when I went to Canada the other day, people paid one-tenth the price in Canada for insulin that they're paying in the United States --	0
Thank you Senator.	0
I want to bring in Congressman Tim Ryan, Congressman Ryan your response?	0
So here we are in Detroit, home of the United Auto workers.	0
We have all our union friends here tonight.	0
This plan that's being offered by Senator Warren and Senator Sanders will tell those Union members who gave away wages in order to get good healthcare that they're going to lose their healthcare because Washington's going to come in and tell them they got a better plan.	0
This is the left and right thing -- new and better is this, move Medicare down to 50.	0
Allow people to buy-in, Kaiser Permanente said that if they -- those 60 million people do that, they will see --	0
Thank you Congressman.	0
A 40 percent reduction --	0
Thank you Congressman.	0
In their healthcare cost, let businesses buy-in, Jake --	0
Thank you Congressman.	0
So Senator, let's talk about that.	0
If Medicare for all is enacted, there are more than 600,000 union members here in Michigan who would be forced to give up their private healthcare plans.	0
Now, I understand that it would provide universal coverage -- but, can you guarantee those union members that the benefits under Medicare for all will be as good as the benefits that they're representatives -- their union reps fought hard to negotiate?	0
Well two things, they will be better because Medicare for all is comprehensive -- it covers all healthcare needs.	0
For senior citizens it will finally include dental care, hearing aids and eyeglasses.	0
But you don't know that -- you don't know that, Bernie.	0
Second of all --	0
I'll come to you in a second, Congressman.	0
I do know it, I wrote the damn bill.	0
And second of all, second of all -- many of our union brothers and sisters, nobody more pro-union than me up here, are now paying high deductibles and copayments when we do Medicare for all, instead of having the company putting money in to healthcare, they can get decent wage increases, which they're not getting today.	0
I want to bring in Congressman Ryan to respond to what Senator Sanders just said.	0
I mean, Senator Sanders does not know all of the union contracts in the United States.	0
I'm trying to explain that these union members are losing their jobs, their wages have been stagnant, the world is crumbling around them -- the only thing they have is possibly really good healthcare.	0
And the Democratic message is going to be, we're going to go in and the only thing you have left we're going to take it and we're going to do better.	0
I do not think that's a recipe for success for us, it's bad policy and it's certainly bad politics.	0
Congressman Delaney.	0
So the bill that Senator Sanders drafted, by definition will lower quality in healthcare, because it says specifically that the rates will be the same as current Medicare rates.	0
And the data is clear, Medicare does not cover the cost of healthcare, it covers 80 percent of the costs of healthcare in this country.	0
And private insurance covers 120 percent, so if you start underpaying all the healthcare providers, you're going to create a two tier market where wealthy people buy their healthcare with cash, and the people who are forced -- like my dad, the union electrician --	0
Thank you Congressman.	0
Will have that healthcare plan taken away from him --	0
Thank you Congressman --	0
They will be forced into an underfunded system.	0
I want to give Senator Sanders -- I want to give Senator Sanders a chance to respond.	0
On the Medicare for all, the hospitals will save substantial sums of money because they're not going to be spending a fortune doing billing and the other bureaucratic things that they have to do today.	0
Second of all --	0
I've done the math, it doesn't add up.	0
Maybe you did that and made money off of healthcare, but our job is to run a nonprofit healthcare system.	0
Furthermore -- furthermore, when we say $500 billion a year by ending all of the incredible complexities that are driving every American crazy trying to deal with the health insurance companies --	0
Thank you Senator.	0
Hospitals will be better off than they are today.	0
Congressman Delaney, I want to let you have a chance to respond.	0
Listen, his math is wrong.	0
That's all I'm saying -- that his math is wrong, it's been well-documented that if all the bills were paid at Medicare rate, which is specifically -- I think it's in section 1,200 of their bill, then many hospitals in this country would close.	1
"I've been going around rural America, and I ask rural hospital administrators one question, ""If all your bills were paid at the Medicare rate last year, what would happen?"""	1
"And they all look at me and say, ""We would close."""	1
But the question is, why do we have to be so extreme?	0
Why can't we just give everyone health care as a right, and allow them to have choice?	0
Thank you, Congressman.	0
I'm starting to think this is not about health care...	0
Thank you, Congressman...	0
This is an anti-private-sector...	0
Thank you Congressman.	0
We're going to move on.	0
... strategy.	0
We're going to move on to the issue of immigration now.	0
There is...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... widespread agreement on this stage on the need for immigration reform, a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, including dreamers.	0
But there are some areas of disagreement.	0
Mayor Buttigieg, you're in favor of getting rid of the law that makes it a crime to come across the U.S. border illegally.	0
Why won't that just encourage more illegal immigration?	0
When I am president, illegally crossing the border will still be illegal.	0
We can argue over the finer points of which parts of this ought to be handled by civil law and which parts ought to be handled by criminal law.	0
But we've got a crisis on our hands.	0
And it's not just a crisis of immigration; it's a crisis of cruelty and incompetence that has created a humanitarian disaster on our southern border.	0
It is a stain on the United States of America.	0
Americans want comprehensive immigration reform.	0
And frankly, we've been talking about the same framework for my entire adult lifetime, protections for DREAMers; making sure that -- that we have a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented; cleaning up lawful immigration.	0
We know what to do.	0
We know that border security can be part of that package and we can still be a nation of laws.	0
The problem is we haven't had the will to get it done in Washington.	0
And now we have a president who could fix it in a month, because there is that bipartisan agreement, but he needs it to be a crisis rather than an achievement.	0
That will end on my watch.	0
But just a point of clarification, you did raise your hand in the last debate.	0
You do want to decriminalize crossing the border illegally?	0
So in my view, if fraud is involved, then that's suitable for the criminal statute.	0
If not, then it should be handled under civil law.	0
But these show of hands are exactly what is wrong with the way that this race is being covered.	0
Well, we're not -- we're not doing that here.	0
And we appreciate that.	0
Congressman -- thank you.	0
Congressman...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... O'Rourke, you live near the U.S.-Mexico border in El Paso.	0
You disagree with Mayor Buttigieg on decriminalizing the border crossings.	0
Please respond.	0
I do, because, in my administration, after we have waived citizenship fees for green card holders, more than 9 million of our fellow Americans; freed DREAMers from any fear of deportation; and stopped criminally prosecuting families and children for seeking asylum and refuge; end for-profit detention in this country; and then assist...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... those countries in Central America so that no family ever has to make that 2,000-mile journey, than I expect that people who come here follow our laws, and we reserve the right to criminally prosecute them if they do not.	0
Thank you, Congressman.	0
Senator Warren, you say the provision making illegal border crossings a crime is totally unnecessary.	0
Please respond.	0
So the problem is that, right now, the criminalization statute is what gives Donald Trump the ability to take children away from their parents.	1
It's what gives him the ability to lock up people at our borders.	0
We need to continue to have border security, and we can do that, but what we can't do is not live our values.	0
I've been down to the border.	0
I have seen the mothers.	0
I have seen the cages of babies.	0
We must be a country that every day lives our values.	0
And that means we cannot...	0
Thank you, Senator Warren.	0
... make it a crime...	0
Just to clarify...	0
... when someone...	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Just to clarify, would you decriminalize...	0
Yes.	0
... illegal border crossings?	0
The point is not about criminalization.	0
That has given Donald Trump the tool to break families apart.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
We need...	0
Governor Hickenlooper, your response?	0
I agree that we need secure borders.	0
There's no question about that.	0
And the frustration with what's going on in Washington is they're kicking the ball back and forth.	0
Secure the borders, make sure whatever law we have doesn't allow children to be snatched from their parents and put in cages.	0
How hard can that be?	0
We've got -- I don't know -- on the two debate nights, we've got 170 years of Washington experience.	0
Somehow it seems like that should be fairly fixable.	0
Well, and one way to fix it is to decriminalize.	0
That's the whole point.	0
What we're...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... looking for here is a way to take away the tool that Donald Trump has used...	0
Thank you, Senator Warren.	0
... to break up families.	0
Thank you, Senator Warren.	0
Senator Klobuchar, your response?	0
I would say there is the will to change this in Congress.	0
What's missing is the right person in the White House.	0
I believe that immigrants don't diminish America; they are America.	0
And if you want to do something...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... about border security, you first of all change the rules so people can seek asylum in those Northern Triangle countries.	0
Then, you pass the bill.	0
And what the bill will do is, it will greatly reduce the deficit and give us some money for border security and for border processing the cases.	0
And most of all, it will allow for a path to citizenship.	0
Because this is not just about the border...	0
Thank you.	0
... Donald Trump wants to use these people as political pawns, when we have people...	0
Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.	0
... all over our country that simply want to work...	0
Thank you.	0
... and obey the law.	0
Senator Sanders, you want to provide undocumented immigrants free health care and free college.	0
Why won't this drive even more people to come to the U.S. illegally?	0
Because we’ll have strong border protections.	0
But the main point I want to make is that what Trump is doing through his racism and his xenophobia, is demonizing a group of people.	0
And as president, I will end that demonization.	0
If a mother and a child walk thousands of miles on a dangerous path, in my view, they are not criminals.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
They are people fleeing violence.	0
And I think the main thing that we’ve got to do -- among many others, and Beto made this point -- we’ve got to ask ourselves, “Why are people walking 2,000 miles to a strange country where they don’t know the language?”	0
So what we will do, the first week we are in the White House, is bring the entire hemisphere together to talk about how we rebuild Honduras...	0
Thank...	0
... Guatemala and El Salvador so people do not have to flee their own countries.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Governor Bullock, about two-thirds of Democratic voters and many of your rivals here for the nomination, support giving health insurance to undocumented immigrants.	0
You haven't gone that far.	0
Why not?	0
Look, I think this is the part of the discussion that shows how often these debates are detached from people's lives.	0
We've got 100,000 people showing up at the border right now.	0
If we decriminalize entry, if we give health care to everyone, we'll have multiples of that.	0
Don't take my word, that was President Obama's Homeland Security secretary that said that.	0
The biggest problem right now that we have with immigration, it's Donald Trump.	0
He's using immigration to not only rip apart families, but rip apart this country.	0
We can actually get to the point where we have safe borders, where we have a path to citizenship, where we have opportunities for Dreamers.	0
And you don't have to decriminalize everything.	0
What you have to do is have a president in there with the judgment and the decency to treat someone that comes to the border like one of our own.	0
You know, I just wanted to...	0
Senator...	0
... add on this...	0
... he just said your plan in unrealistic.	0
How do you respond?	0
You know, I think that what we have to do, is we have to be an America that is clear about what we want to do with immigration.	0
We need to expand legal immigration.	0
We need to create a path for citizenship, not just for Dreamers but for grandmas and for people who have been working here in the farms and for students who have overstayed their visas...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... we need to fix the crisis at the border.	0
And a big part of how we do that, is we do not play into Donald Trump's hands.	0
But...	0
He wants to stir up the crisis at the border because that's his overall message.	0
It's -- if there's anything wrong in your life, blame them.	0
Thank you, Senator Warren.	0
Governor Bullock, your response?	0
But you are playing into Donald Trump's hands.	0
The challenge isn't that it's a criminal offense to cross the border.	0
The challenge is that Donald Trump is president, and using this to rip families apart.	0
A sane immigration system needs a sane leader.	0
And we can do that without decriminalizing and providing health care for everyone.	0
And it's not me saying that, that's Obama's Homeland Security secretary...	0
No.	0
... that said you'll cause further problems at the border, not making it better.	0
What -- what you're saying is ignore the law.	0
Laws matter.	0
And it matters if we say our law is that we will lock people up who come here, seeking refuge, who come here, seeking asylum, that is not a crime.	0
And as Americans, what we need to do is have a sane system that keeps us safe at the border, but does not criminalize the activity...	0
Thank you, Senator Warren.	0
... of a mother fleeing here for safety.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Dana, I must correct the record	0
Congressman Ryan, are Senator Sanders’ proposals going to incentivize undocumented immigrants to come into this country illegally?	0
Yes.	0
And right now, if you want to come into the country, you should at least ring the doorbell.	0
We have asylum laws.	0
I saw the kids up in Grand Rapids, not far from here.	0
It is shameful what's happening.	0
But Donald Trump is doing it.	0
And even if you decriminalize, which we should not do, you still have statutory authority.	0
The president could still use his authority to separate families.	0
So we've got to get rid of Donald Trump.	0
But you don't decriminalize people just walking into the United States.	0
If they're seeking asylum, of course, we want to welcome them.	0
We're a strong enough country to be able to welcome them.	0
And as far as the healthcare goes, undocumented people can buy healthcare too.	0
I mean everyone else in America is paying for their healthcare.	0
I think - I don't think it's a stretch for us to ask undocumented people in the country to also pay for healthcare.	0
Senator Sanders, your response?	0
Well, I have two things.	0
A sane immigration policy moves the comprehensive immigration reform.	0
It moves to a humane border policy, and which, by the way, we have enough administrative judges, so that we don’t have incredible backlogs that we have right now.	0
But to your answer your question, I happen to believe that when I talk about healthcare as a human right that applies to all people in this country, and under a Medicare for All single payer system, we could afford to do that.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Sanders, thank you.	0
And Ms. Williamson, your response?	0
Everything that we're talking about here tonight is what's wrong with American politics, and the Democratic Party needs to understand that we should be the party that talks, not just about symptoms, but also about causes.	0
When it - when we're talking about healthcare, we need to talk about more than just the healthcare plan.	0
We need to realize, we have a sickness care rather than a healthcare system.	0
We need to be the party talking about why so many of our chemical policies and our food policies and our agricultural policies and our environment policies and even our economic policies are leading to people sick to begin with.	0
Thank you --	0
That's what the democratic -- but I want to say more --	0
Thank you, Ms. Williamson.	0
#NAME?	0
OK.	0
Thank you, Ms. Williamson.	0
I hope you’ll come back to me this time.	0
Go ahead.	0
Thank you, Ms. Williamson.	0
Let’s turn now to the issue of gun violence.	0
There were three large-scale shootings this past week in America, at a park in Brooklyn, on the streets on Philadelphia and one that left three dead and 12 injured at a food festival in Gilroy, California.	0
Governor - excuse me, Mayor Buttigieg, other than offering words of comfort, what’re you specially going to do to stop this epidemic of gun violence?	0
Well, this epidemic of gun violence has hit my community too, far too many times.	0
It’s the worst part of being there, getting the phone call, consoling, grieving parents.	0
And we have a mass shooting’s worth of killings everyday in this country.	0
What we’re doing hasn’t worked because we haven’t had a system in Washington capable of delivering what the American people have told us they want.	0
Eighty, 90 percent of Republicans want universal background checks, not to mention the common sense solutions like red flag laws that disarmed domestic abusers and flag mental health risks and an end to assault weapons, things like what I carried overseas in uniform, that have no business in American neighbors in peace time, let alone anywhere near a school.	0
I was at an event a few days ago, and a 13-year-old asked me what we’re going to do about school safety, and then began shaking and then began crying.	0
And we can talk about these policies, but we already know the policies.	0
I only thing I could think of, looking into the eyes of this child, is we’re supposed to be dealing with this so you don’t have to.	0
High school is hard enough, without having to worry about whether you’re going to get shot.	0
Thank you.	0
And when 90 percent of Americans want something to happen --	0
Thank you, Mayor.	0
-- and Washington --	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Thank you, Mayor.	0
Thank you, Mayor.	0
Governor Hickenlooper, your response please?	0
I disagree - I disagree with his diagnosis of the problem.	0
Please standby, Senator.	0
OK.	0
Please stick to the rules.	0
We'll get to you - we'll come to you in a just a minute.	0
Governor Hickenlooper, please respond.	0
Well, this is the fundamental nonsense of government, another thing - another place where, despite our best efforts, we can't seem to make any progress.	0
You know, when I went to the - to the movie theater in Aurora in 2012, and saw that footage of what happened at that crime scene, I'll never forget it.	0
And we decided, you know, that we were going to go out and take on the NRA, and we passed as a purple state.	0
We passed universal background checks.	0
We limited magazine capacity.	0
We did the basic work that for whatever reason doesn't seem to be able to get done in Washington.	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
Senator Klobuchar, please respond.	0
Yes, this isn’t just about a system, or it’s not just about words.	0
This is about the NRA.	0
I sat across from the president of the United States after Parkland, because I’ve been a leader on these issues and have the will to close to a boyfriend loophole.	0
And I watched and wrote down when, nine times, he said he wanted universal background checks.	0
The next day, he goes and he meets with the NRA, and he folds.	0
As your president, I will not fold.	0
I will make sure that we get universal background checks passed, the assault weapon ban, that we do something about magazines, and that we understand when 6 little - little 6-year-old boy died, Stephen Romero, when his dad said he’s only 6 years old, all I can -	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
- say is he's 6 years old.	0
Mayor Buttigieg, please respond.	0
We have to remember that.	0
This is the exact same conversation we’ve been having since - since I was in high school.	0
I was a junior when the Columbine shooting happened.	0
I was part of the first generation that saw routine school shootings.	0
We have now produced the second school shooting generation in this country.	0
We better not allow there to be a third.	0
Something is broken if it is even possible for the same debate around the same solutions that we all know are the right thing to do.	0
They won’t prevent every incident.	0
They won’t save every life.	0
But we know what to do, and it has not happened.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Mayor.	0
Senator Klobuchar, please respond.	0
Yes.	0
What is broken is a political system that allows the NRA and other large, big money to come in and make things not happen when the majority of people are for.	0
The people are with us now.	0
After Parkland, those students just didn’t march.	0
They talked to their dads and their grandpas and the hunters in their family, and they said there must be a better way.	0
Then we elected people in the House of Representatives.	0
And guess what?	0
It changed, and they passed universal background checks.	0
And now that bill is sitting on Mitch McConnell’s doorstep because of the money and the power of the NRA.	0
As president, I will take them on.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
This is not about systems and words.	0
Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Governor Bullock, how can Democrats trust you to be the leader on this fight for gun safety when you only changed your position to call for an assault weapons ban last summer?	0
You know, like 40 percent of American households, I’m a gun-owner.	0
I hunt.	0
Like far too many people in America, I’ve been personally impacted by gun violence.	0
Had an 11-year-old nephew, Jeremy, shot and killed on a playground.	0
We need to start looking at this as a public health issue, not a political issue.	0
I agree with Senator Klobuchar.	0
It is the NRA.	0
And it's not just gun violence.	0
It's when we talked about climate, when we talk about prescription drug costs, Washington, D.C., is captured by dark money, the Koch brothers, and others.	0
That's been the fight of my career.	0
Kicking the Koch brothers out of Montana, taking the first case after Citizens United up to the Supreme Court, making it so that elections are about people.	0
That's the way we're actually going to make a change on this, Don, is by changing that system.	0
And most of the things that folks are talking about on this stage we're not going to address until we kick dark money and the post-Citizens United corporate spending out of these elections.	0
Congressman O'Rourke, your response?	0
How else can we explain that we lose nearly 40,000 people in this country to gun violence, a number that no other country comes even close to, that we know what all the solutions are, and yet nothing has changed?	0
It is because, in this country, money buys influence, access, and, increasingly, outcomes.	0
The Centers for Disease Control prevented from actually studying the issue in the first place.	0
As president, we will make sure that we ban political action committee contributions to any member of Congress or any candidate for federal office.	0
We will listen to people, not PACs, people, not corporations, people, not special interests.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Congressman, thank you very much.	0
If you pass the strongest gun control legislation tomorrow, I don't think it will have a profound effect on the tragedies we have seen.	0
Do you still agree with that statement today?	0
I think we have got to do -- I think what I meant is what President Obama said, in that nobody up here is going to tell you that we have a magical solution to the crisis.	0
Now, I come from one of the most rural states in America.	0
I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA.	0
And as president I suspect it will be an F record.	0
What I believe we have got to do is have the guts to finally take on the NRA.	0
You asked me about my record.	0
Back in 1988, coming from a state that had no gun control, I called for the ban of the sale and distribution of assault weapons.	0
I lost that election.	0
I will do everything I can not only to take on the NRA, but to expand and create universal background checks, do away with the strawman provision, do away with the gun show loophole, and do away with the loopholes that now exist for gun manufacturers who are selling large amounts of weapons into communities that are going to gangs.	0
Yeah.	0
Mayor Buttigieg, your response.	0
Still the conversation that we've been having for the last 20 years.	0
Of course we need to get money out of politics.	0
But when I propose the actual structural democratic reforms that might make a difference, end the Electoral College, amend the Constitution, if necessary, to clear up Citizens United, have D.C. actually be a state, and depoliticize the Supreme Court with structural reform, people look at me funny, as if this country were incapable of structural reform.	0
Does anybody really think we're going to overtake Citizens United without constitutional action?	0
This is a country that once changed its Constitution so you couldn't drink and then changed it back because we changed our minds about that.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, Mayor.	0
And you're telling me we can't reform our democracy in our time?	0
Thank you, Mayor.	0
We have to or we'll be having the same argument 20 years from now.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Please respond, Governor Bullock.	0
You can make changes.	0
Even in Montana, with a two-thirds Republican legislature, we passed a law that said, if you're going to spend money in our elections, I don't care if you call yourselves Americans for America for America, you're going to have to disclose every one of those dollars in the last 90 days.	0
I'll never forget running for re-election in 2016.	0
Even we stopped the Koch brothers from spending it that time.	0
If we can kick the Koch brothers out of Montana, we can do it in D.C., we can do it everywhere.	0
And we're also taking steps, additional steps that we've taken -- I passed an executive order.	0
If you're even going to contract with the state...	0
Governor Bullock, thank you very much.	0
I'd like to have a chance on this.	0
Ms. Williamson, how do you respond to this issue of gun safety?	0
The issue of gun safety, of course, is that the NRA has us in a chokehold, but so do the pharmaceutical companies, so do the health insurance companies, so do the fossil fuel companies, and so do the defense contractors, and none of this will change until we either pass a constitutional amendment or pass legislation that establishes public funding for federal campaigns.	0
But for politicians, including my fellow candidates, who themselves have taken tens of thousands -- and in some cases, hundreds of thousands -- of dollars from these same corporate donors to think that they now have the moral authority to say we're going to take them on, I don't think the Democratic Party should be surprised that so many Americans believe yada, yada, yada.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
That is over.	0
We are going to establish public funding for federal campaigns.	0
That's what we need to stand up to.	0
We need to have a constitutional amendment.	0
We need to have -- we need to have legislation to do it.	0
Thank you.	0
And until we do it, it's just the same old, same old.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, Ms. Williamson.	0
The debate will be right back right after this short break.	0
Presidential Debate, we are live from Detroit, Michigan.	0
In poll after poll Democratic voters say that they want a candidate who can beat President Trump, more than they want a candidate who agrees with them on major issues.	0
"Governor Hickenlooper, you ran a Facebook ad that warned ""socialism is not the answer."""	0
"The ad also said, ""don't let extremes give Trump four more years,"" are you saying that Senator Sanders is too extreme to beat President Trump?"	0
I'm saying the policies of -- this notion that you're going to take private insurance away from 180 million Americans who, many of them don't want to give -- many of them do want to get rid of it, but some don't -- many don't.	0
Or you're going to -- the Green New Deal make sure that every American's guaranteed a government job if they want, that is a disaster at the ballot box, you might as well FedEx the election to Donald Trump.	0
I think we've got to focus on where Donald Trump is failing, you know, the world malpractice, and this is interesting -- I always thought it was doctors or lawyers, it's -- you know negligent, improper, illegal professional activity for doctors, lawyers or public officials, Google it, check it out.	0
Donald Trump is malpractice personified, we've got to point that out.	0
Why is it soybean farmers in Iowa need 10 good years to get back to where they were 2 years ago?	0
Where's the small manufacturing jobs that are supposed to come back?	0
Why are we lurching from one international crisis to another?	0
All things that he promised American voters, we've got to focus on that -- and the economy, and jobs, and training, so that we can promise a future for America that everybody wants to invest it.	0
Thank you Governor.	0
Senator Sanders you are a proud Democratic-Socialist, how do you respond to Governor Hickenlooper?	0
Well the truth is that every credible poll that I have seen has me beating Donald Trump -- including the battleground states of Michigan, where I won the Democratic primary -- Wisconsin where I won the Democratic primary, and Pennsylvania.	0
And the reason we are going to defeat Trump, and beat him badly is that he is a fraud and a phony and we’re going to expose him for what he is.	0
The American people want to have a minimum wage which is a living wage, $15 an hour.	0
I’ve helped lead that effort.	0
The American people want to pay reasonable prices for prescription drugs, not the highest prices in the world --	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
I've helped lead the effort for that as well.	0
Thank you Senator.	0
Governor Hickenlooper, I want to bring you back to respond?	0
So again, I think if we're going to force Americans to make these radical changes, they're not going to go along -- throw your hands up --	0
All right --	0
Oh-ho, I can do it.	0
But you haven’t implemented the plans, us governors and mayors are the ones, we have to pick up all the pieces when suddenly the government’s supposed to take over all these responsibilities, and there’s no preparation, the details aren’t worked.	0
You can’t just spring a plan on the world and expect it to succeed --	0
John --	0
Senator Sanders?	0
John, I was a mayor and I helped transform my city -- I have some practical experience.	0
Second of all, interestingly enough today is the anniversary of Medicare -- 54 years ago under Linda Johnson of the Democratic Congress they started a new program after one year 19 million elderly people in it.	0
Please don’t tell me that in a four year period we cannot go from 65 down to 55, to 45, to 35 -- this is not radical.	0
This is what virtually every other country on Earth runs --	0
Thank you Senator.	0
We are the odd dog out.	0
I want to bring in -- I want to bring in Congressman Ryan.	0
You're from the state of Ohio, it's a state that voted twice for Obama and then went to President Trump in 2016, please respond to Senator Sanders.	0
Well I would just say Hillary Clinton was winning in the polls too, to take a snapshot in the polls today and apply it 16 months from now or whenever it is, I don't think is accurate.	0
Now in this discussion already tonight we've talked about taking private health insurance away from union members in the industrial Midwest, we've talked about decriminalizing the border, and we've talked about giving free healthcare to undocumented workers when so many Americans are struggling to pay for their healthcare.	0
I quite frankly don't think that that is an agenda that we can move forward on and win.	0
We've got to talk about the working class issues, the people that take a shower after work, who haven't had a raise in 30 years --	0
Thank you -- thank you Congressman --	0
If we focus on that, we'll win the election.	0
Thank you Congressman, I want to bring Congressman O'Rourke, your response, sir?	0
Bernie was talking about some of the battleground states in which we compete -- there is a new battleground state, Texas and it has 38 electoral college votes.	0
And the way that we put it in play was by going to each one of those 254 counties.	0
No matter how red or rural, we did not write you off.	0
No matter how blue, or urban -- we did not take you for granted.	0
And we didn't trim our sails, either.	0
We had the courage of our convictions, talking about universal health care, comprehensive immigration reform, and confronting the challenge of climate before it is too late.	0
We brought everyone in...	0
Thank you.	0
... and now we have a chance to beat Donald Trump with Texas.	0
Thank you, Congressman.	0
I want to bring in Governor Bullock.	0
We're talking about whether Democrats are moving too far to the left to win the White House.	0
President Trump won your home state of Montana by 20 points.	0
How do you respond, sir?	0
Yeah, as the only one of the field of 37 that actually won a Trump state -- 25 percent to 30 percent of my voters voted for Donald Trump -- I know that we do have to win back some of those places we lost and get those Trump voters back if we’re ever going to win.	0
But this isn't just a choice between the left and the center.	0
It's not a choice just between sort of these wish list economics or thinking that we have to sacrifice our values to actually win.	0
What folks want is a fair shot.	0
The way I won, the way we can win is to actually focus on the economy and the democracy aren't working for most people.	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
That's how I win.	0
That's how we can take back the office.	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
Senator Warren, you make it a point to say that you're a capitalist.	0
Is that your way of convincing voters that you might be a safer choice than Senator Sanders?	0
No.	0
It is my way of talking about I know how to fight and I know how to win.	0
I took on giant banks, and I beat them.	0
I took on Wall Street, and CEOs, and their lobbyists, and their lawyers, and I beat them.	0
I took on a popular Republican incumbent senator, and I beat him.	0
I remember when people said Barack Obama couldn't get elected.	0
Shoot, I remember when people said Donald Trump couldn't get elected.	0
But here's where we are.	0
I get it.	0
There is a lot at stake, and people are scared.	0
But we can't choose a candidate we don't believe in just because we're too scared to do anything else.	0
And we can't ask other people to vote for a candidate we don't believe in.	0
Democrats win when we figure out what is right and we get out there and fight for it.	0
I am not afraid.	0
And for Democrats to win, you can't be afraid, either.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Congressman Delaney, your response?	0
So -- so I think Democrats win when we run on real solutions, not impossible promises, when we run on things that are workable, not fairy tale economics.	0
building infrastructure, creating jobs, improving their pay...	0
Thank you, Congressman.	0
... creating universal health care, and lowering drug prices.	0
Thank you, Congressman.	0
Senator Warren?	0
We can do it.	0
You know, I don't understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really can't do and shouldn't fight for.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I don't get it.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Our biggest problem in Washington is corruption.	0
It is giant corporations that have taken our government and that are holding it by the throat.	0
And we need to have the courage to fight back against that.	0
And until we're ready to do that, it's just more of the same.	0
Well, I'm ready to get in this fight.	0
I'm ready to win this fight.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Congressman Delaney?	0
When we created Social Security, we didn't say pensions were illegal, right?	0
We can have big ideas to transform the lives.	0
I mean, I started two companies and took them public before I was 40.	0
I'm as big of a dreamer and an entrepreneur as anyone.	0
But I also believe we need to have solutions that are workable.	0
Can you imagine if we tried to start Social Security now but said private pensions are illegal?	0
That's the equivalent of what Senator Sanders and Senator Warren are proposing with health care.	0
That's not a big idea.	0
That's an idea that's dead on arrival.	0
That will never happen.	0
So why don't we actually talk about things, big ideas that we can get done?	0
The stakes are too high.	0
Thank you, Congressman.	0
Senator Warren?	0
So, look, he talks...	0
He just mentioned my name.	0
We'll come to you right after that.	0
Senator Warren?	0
He talks about solutions that are workable.	0
We have tried the solution of Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance.	0
And what have the private insurance companies done?	0
They've sucked billions of dollars out of our health care system.	0
They've made everybody fill out dozens and dozens of forms.	0
Why?	0
Not because they're trying to track your health care.	0
They just want one more excuse to say no.	0
Insurance companies do not have a God-given right to suck money out of our health care system.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
And 2020 is our chance to stop it.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Senator Sanders?	0
Detroit was mentioned.	0
And I'm delighted that Detroit is rebounding.	0
But let us understand, Detroit was nearly destroyed because of awful trade policy which allowed corporations to throw workers in this community out on the streets as they moved to low-wage countries.	0
To win this election, and to defeat Donald Trump -- which, by the way, in my view, is not going to be easy -- we need to have a campaign of energy and excitement and of vision.	0
We need to bring millions of young people into the political process in a way that we have never seen by, among other things, making public colleges...	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
... and universities tuition-free and canceling student debt.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I want to bring in -- I want to bring in Senator Klobuchar.	0
At the beginning of the night, you said you're going to hear a lot of promises on the stage.	0
"And previously you have said, when asked about your primary opponents, quote, ""A lot of people are making promises, and I'm not going to make promises just to get elected."""	0
Who on this stage is making promises just to get elected?	0
Everyone wants to get elected.	0
But my point is this: I think when we have a guy in the White House that has now told over 10,000 lies, that we'd better be very straightforward with the American people.	0
And, no, do I think that we are going to end up voting for a plan that kicks half of America off of their current insurance in four years?	0
No, I don't think we're going to do that.	0
I think there is a better way to get what we all want to see, which is lower costs for health care.	0
Do I think that we're going to vote to give free college to the wealthiest kids?	0
No, I don't think we're going to do that.	0
So that's what I'm talking about.	0
But what I don't like about this argument right now, what I don't like about it at all, is that we are more worried about winning an argument than winning an election.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And I think how we win an election is to bring everyone with us.	0
And, yes, I have won in a state every single time statewide.	0
I have won those congressional districts that Donald Trump won by over 20 points.	0
He just targeted Minnesota last week.	0
And I have done it by getting out there and talking to people, by knowing rural issues and farm issues...	0
Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.	0
... and bringing metro people with me in the state that had the highest voter turnout in the country.	0
Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
That's what we want.	0
I want to bring in Congressman O'Rourke.	0
Congressman O'Rourke, please respond.	0
You know, I think a big part of leadership and showing our commitment to the American people is delivering on our commitments.	0
As a member of Congress, when I learned that the El Paso V.A.	0
had the worst wait times for mental health care in the country, meaning that care delayed functionally became care denied, and was related to the suicide epidemic, we made it our priority and we turned around the V.A.	0
in El Paso.	0
We took that lesson nationally and I worked with Republican and Democratic colleagues to expand medical health care to veterans, and we got it signed into law by the one person with whom I agree on almost nothing -- Donald Trump -- to show that, at the end of the day, we will put the American people first...	0
Thank you.	0
... before party, before any other concern.	0
Thank you, Congressman O'Rourke.	0
We've been asking voters to weigh in on what they'd most like to hear Democrats debate.	0
Among the topics they told us they're most interested in, the climate crisis.	0
Congressman Delaney, I’ll start with you.	0
You say the Green New Deal is about as realistic as Trump saying Mexico is going to pay for the wall.	0
But scientists say we need essentially to eliminate fossil fuel pollution by 2050 to avoid the most catastrophic consequences.	0
Why isn’t this sweeping plan to fight the climate crisis realistic?	0
Well, first of all, because it ties its progress to other things that are completely unrelated to climate, like universal health care, guaranteed government jobs, and universal basic income.	0
So that only makes it harder to do.	0
My plan, which gets us to net zero by 2050, which we absolutely have to do for our kids and our grandkids, will get us there.	0
I put a price on carbon, take all the money, give it back to the American people in a dividend.	0
That was introduced by me on a bipartisan basis.	0
It's the only significant bipartisan climate bill in the Congress.	0
I’m going to increase the Department of Energy research budget by fivefold, because we fundamentally have to innovate our way out of this problem.	0
I’m going to create a market for something called direct air capture, which are machines that actually take carbon out of the atmosphere, because I don’t think we’ll get to net zero by 2050 unless we have those things.	0
I’m going to increase investment in renewables and I’m going to create something called the Climate Corps.	0
That is a plan that's realistic.	0
It's a bet on the U.S. private innovation economy and creates the incentives to get us to net zero by 2050 for our kids.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, Congressman.	0
Senator Warren, you’re a cosponsor of the Green New Deal.	0
Your response to Congressman Delaney?	0
So, climate crisis is the existential crisis for our world.	0
It puts every living thing on this planet at risk.	0
I have a plan for a green industrial policy that takes advantage of the fact that we do what we do best, and that is innovate and create.	0
So I've proposed putting $2 trillion in so we do the research.	0
We then say anyone in the world can use it, so long as you build it right here in America.	0
That will produce about 1.2 million manufacturing jobs right here in Michigan, right here in Ohio, right here in the industrial Midwest.	0
And the second thing we will do is we will then sell those products all around the world.	0
Right now, for every $1 the United States...	0
Thank you.	0
... spends trying to market around the world...	0
Thank you, Senator Warren.	0
... China is spending $100.	0
Thank you, Senator Warren.	0
Governor Hickenlooper, you take issue with the green new deal.	0
Please respond.	0
Well, I think the guarantee for a public job for everyone who wants one is a classic part of the problem.	0
It's a distraction.	0
I share the urgency of everyone up here.	0
We have to recognize -- I mean, everyone's got good ideas.	0
What we do in this country is no better than just a best practice, right?	0
It's what we do here is a best practice and a template, but it's got to be done all over the world.	0
So we’ve got to be building bridges right now with people like China, who were cheating on international agreements and stealing intellectual property.	0
We need to work on that, but not with a tariff system.	0
We need every country working together if we’re going to really deal with climate change in a realistic way.	0
Thank you.	0
Senator Warren, your response?	0
Look, I put a real policy on the table to create 1.2 million new jobs in green manufacturing.	0
There's going to be a $23 trillion worldwide market for this.	0
This could revitalize huge cities across this country.	0
And no one wants to talk about it.	0
"What you want to do instead is find the Republican talking point of a made-up piece of some other part and say, ""Oh, we don't really have to do anything."""	0
That’s the problem we’ve got in Washington right now.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
It continues to be a Washington that works great for oil companies, just not for people worried about climate change.	0
Thank you, Senator Warren.	0
Congressman Ryan, we are here in Michigan, where there are about 180,000 workers in auto manufacturing.	0
Your state of Ohio has around 96,000 workers in that industry.	0
Senator Sanders is co-sponsoring a bill that would eliminate new gas-powered car sales by 2040.	0
Given the number of auto manufacturing workers in your state, how concerned are you about Senator Sanders' plan?	0
Well, if we get our act together, we won't have to worry about it.	0
I -- my plan is to create a chief manufacturing officer so we could actually start making things in the United States again, that would pull the government, the Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, work with the private sector, work with investors, emerging tech companies, to dominate the electric vehicle market.	0
China dominates it now, 50 percent to 60 percent.	0
I want us to dominate the battery market, make those here in the United States and cut the workers in on the deal.	0
The charging stations, solar panels, same thing; China dominates 60 percent of the solar panel market.	0
So this person will work in the White House, report directly to me, and we're going to start making things again.	0
But you cannot get there on climate unless we talk about agriculture.	0
We need to convert our industrial agriculture system over to a sustainable and regenerative agriculture system...	0
I agree.	0
... that actually sequesters carbon...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... into the soil.	0
And you can go ask -- you can go ask Gabe Brown and Allen Williams, who actually make money off of regenerative agriculture.	0
So we can move away...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... from all the subsidies that we're giving the farmers.	0
They haven't made a profit in five years.	0
And we could start getting good food into our schools and into our communities.	0
And that's going to drive health care down.	0
That's another part of the health care conversation...	0
Thank you.	0
... that we didn't even have.	0
How do we start talking about health...	0
Thank you, Congressman Ryan.	0
... instead of just disease care?	0
Thank you.	0
Senator Sanders, your response?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I get a little bit tired of Democrats afraid of big ideas.	0
Republicans are not afraid of big ideas.	0
They could give $1 trillion in tax breaks to billionaires and profitable corporations.	0
They could bail out the crooks on Wall Street.	0
So please don't tell me that we cannot take on the fossil fuel industry.	0
And nothing happens unless we do that.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Here is the bottom line.	0
"We've got to ask ourselves a simple question, ""What do you do with an industry that knowingly, for billions of dollars in short-term profits, is destroying this planet?"""	0
I say that is criminal activity that cannot be allowed to continue.	0
Thank you, Senator Sanders.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Congressman, your response?	0
Well, I would just say -- I didn't say we couldn't get there until 2040, Bernie.	0
You don't have to yell.	0
I mean, all I'm saying is...	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
All I'm saying is we have to invent our way out of this thing.	0
And if we're waiting for 2040 for a ban to come in on gasoline vehicles, we're screwed.	0
So we better get busy now.	0
And that's why I'm saying get a chief manufacturing officer, align the environmental incentives with the financial incentives, and make sure that people can actually make money off of the new technologies that are moving forward.	0
And then here's what I'll do as president...	0
Thank you, Congressman.	0
... cut the worker in on the deal.	0
Make sure these are union jobs.	0
And I will double union membership to make sure these new jobs pay what the old fossil fuel jobs pay.	0
Senator Sanders, your response?	0
On this issue, my friends, there is no choice.	0
We have got to be super aggressive if we love our children and if we want to leave them a planet that is healthy and is habitable, so I don’t disagree with Tim.	0
What that means is we got to, A, take on the fossil fuel industry, B, it means we have to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy, at a hell of a lot of good union jobs, as we do that.	0
We got to transform our transportation ...	0
Thank you, Senator ...	0
... system, and we have to lead the world ...	0
Thank you, Senator Sanders.	0
... because this is not just an American issue.	0
Governor Bullock, your response?	0
You know, all of us agree that we have address climate change.	0
No one on this stage is talking about it.	0
The Republicans won’t even acknowledge that climate change is real, Dana, and that’s because of the corrupting influence and money.	0
That has been the fight of my career.	0
And second of which, as we transition to this clean energy economy, you’ve got to recognize, there are folks that have spent their whole life powering our country, and far too often, Democrats sound like they’re part of the problem.	0
We got to make sure to aid in those transition as we get to a carbon neutral world, which I think we can do by 2020.	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
Just to clarify, who is part of the problem?	0
Who - oh, no, I - I think Democrats often, when they're saying, oh, these fossil fuel industries, these workers, those coal miner workers.	0
Look, the world's changing.	0
We got to make a change, but I think Democrats often sound like the people that, as Congressman Ryan would say, shower at the end of the day, that they're part of the problem.	0
And far too many communities are being left behind, as we make this transition.	0
Thank you.	0
Look, we’re having this discussion, and we can talk about competing plans...	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
I want to give Senator Sanders a chance to respond.	0
Look, Steve, there ain't nobody in the Congress who's more strongly pro-worker than I am.	0
So when I talk about taking on the fossil fuel industry, what I am also talking about is a just transition.	0
All right.	0
We can create what the Green New Deal is about.	0
It's a bold idea.	0
We can create millions of good-paying jobs.	0
We can rebuild communities in rural America that have been devastated.	0
So we are not anti-worker.	0
We are going to provide and make sure that those workers have a transition, new jobs, healthcare and education.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
And look ...	0
Governor Bullock, your response?	0
And look, Bernie, I was a union side labor lawyer.	0
I fought day after day, and I know - but we've set this is a false choice far too often.	0
Are we going to actually address climate change?	0
Fire seasons are 80 days longer in the west now.	0
Or are we going to give people a better shot at a better life?	0
You can do both, but let's actually have the scientists drive this.	0
Let's not just talk about plans that are written for press releases that will go nowhere else if we can't get a Republican to acknowledge ...	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
... that the climate's changing.	0
Congressman O'Rourke, your response?	0
I've listen to the sciences on this, and they're very clear.	0
We don't have more than 10 years to get this right, and we won't meet that challenge with half-steps or half-measures or only half the country.	0
We've got to bring everyone in.	0
The people of Detroit and those that I listened to in Flint last week, they want the challenge.	0
They want those jobs.	0
They want to create the future for this country and the world.	0
Those community college students that I met in Tucumcari, New Mexico understand that wind and solar jobs are the fastest-growing jobs in the country.	0
And those farmers in Iowa say pay me for the environmental services of planting cover crops and keeping more land in conservation easements.	0
That's how we meet the challenge.	0
We do it with everyone in this country.	0
We bring everyone in to the solution.	0
Thank you, Congressman.	0
Mayor Buttigieg, your response?	0
We have all put out highly similar visions on climate.	0
It is all theoretical.	0
We will deal with climate, if and only if we win the presidency, if and only if we beat Donald Trump.	0
Nominate me, and you get to see the president of the United States stand next to an American war veteran and explain why he chose to pretend to be disabled when it was chance to serve.	0
Nominate me, and we will have a different conversation with American voters about why the president of the United States thinks you're a sucker, when the problem in your life is your paycheck is not going up nearly as fast as the cost of housing or the cost of education ...	0
Thank you.	0
... or the cost of prescription drugs.	0
And he has done nothing about it except ...	0
Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.	0
... the tax cuts for the corporations.	0
Hi, Senator Klobuchar.	0
I want to ask you about something that CNN heard from a Michigan Democratic primary voter, but we’re reaching out and getting their questions.	0
Kimber from Birmingham, Michigan has this question, “what is your plan to address infrastructure, including the water issue so another Flint, Michigan does not happen again?”	0
Thank you Dana, and I was just in Flint.	0
And they are still drinking bottled water in that town and that is outrageous.	0
So my plan, and I am the first one that came out with an infrastructure plan and I did that because this is a bread and butter issue.	0
It's a bread and butter issue for people that are caught in traffic jams.	0
I think the Governor here in Michigan smartly ran on the slogan, “fix the damn roads,” and it is an issue for union jobs.	0
And so I think what we need to do is not have a president that’s promised he was going to do that on election night, if anyone remembers.	0
And then he hasn’t followed through -- he has done nothing, he blew up a meeting at the White House.	0
I would put $1 trillion in to this, and I would pay for it by first of all changing the capital gains rate by doing something when it comes to that regressive tax bill that left everyone behind, but really made his Mar-a-Lago friends richer as he promised.	0
And I would take that money and put it in to rural broadband and green infrastructure so you won't have what you just saw in Detroit with the Jefferson Chalmers neighborhood, the African neighborhood -- that was African-American neighborhood that was most-hit when you had those recent rainstorms.	0
And I truly believe that if we're going to move on infrastructure --	0
Thank you --	0
And climate change, you need a voice from the Heartlands.	0
Is this -- thank you Senator Klobuchar, Ms. Williamson, what's your response on the Flint water crisis?	0
My response on the Flint water crisis is that Flint is just the tip of the iceberg.	0
I was recently in Denmark, South Carolina where it is -- there is a lot of talk about it being the next Flint.	0
We have an administration that has gutted the Clean Water Act.	0
We have communities, particularly communities of color and disadvantaged communities all over this country who are suffering from environmental injustice.	0
I assure you, I lived Grosse Pointe -- what happened in Flint would not have happened in Grosse Pointe.	0
This is part of the dark underbelly of American society.	0
The racism, the bigotry, and the entire conversation that we’re having here tonight -- if you think any of this wonkiness is going to deal with this dark psychic force of the collectivized hatred that this president is bringing up in this country, then I’m afraid that the Democrats are going to see some very dark days.	0
We need to say it like it is, it's bigger than Flint -- it's all over this country, it's particularly people of color -- it's particularly people who do not have the money to fight back.	0
And if the Democrats don't start saying it, then why would those people feel that they're there for us and if those people don't feel it, they won't vote for us, and Donald Trump will win.	0
Thank you very much Ms. Williamson.	0
Thank you.	0
We want to turn now to the issue of race in America.	0
Congressman O'Rourke, President Trump is pursuing a reelection strategy based in part, on racial division.	0
How do you convince primary voters that you'd be the best nominee to take on President Trump and heal the racial divide in America?	0
We'll call his racism out for what it is, and also talk about its consequences.	0
"It doesn't just offend our sensibilities to hear him say ""send her back,"" about a member of Congress, because she's a woman color, because she's a Muslim-American doesn't just offend our sensibilities when he calls Mexican immigrants ""rapists and criminals,"" or seeks to ban all Muslims from the shores of a country that's comprised of people from the world over, from every tradition of faith."	0
It is also changing this country.	0
Hate crimes are in the rise -- every single one of the last three years, on the day that he signed his executive order attempting to ban Muslim travel, the mosque in Victoria, Texas was burned to the ground.	0
So we must not only stand up against Donald Trump and defeat him in this next election, but we must also ensure that we don't just tolerate or respect our differences, but we embrace them.	0
That's what we've learned in El Passo, Texas -- my hometown.	0
One of the safest cities in the United States of America, not despite, but because it's a city of immigrants and asylum seekers, and refugees.	0
We will show that our diversity --	0
Thank you.	0
O'ROURKE Is our strength in my administration.	0
Congressman O'Rourke, thank you very much.	0
Governor Hickenlooper, why are you the best nominee to heal the racial divide in America, please respond.	0
Well the core value behind this entire country's history is working towards a more perfect union, that all people are created equal.	0
And we've fallen far away from that.	0
I think the job is incumbent on any one of us to make the convincing case that we can deliver an urban agenda that represents progress in schools.	0
In Colorado when I was Mayor we got universal pre-K for every kid in the urban city.	0
We did major police reform 10 years before Ferguson -- why is it now that five years after Ferguson we still don't have anything?	0
How do we get affordable housing?	0
We created a scholarship fund for every kid -- you've got to deliver a vision like that for the whole country.	0
Thank you Governor.	0
Senator Warren, I’m coming to you now.	0
Last week the FBI Director Christopher Wray said that the majority of domestic terrorism cases this year have been motivated by white supremacy.	0
In fact, the alleged shooter in this weekend’s attack in Gilroy, California referenced a well-known white supremacist book on social media.	0
How are you going to combat the rise of white supremacy?	0
We need to call out white supremacy for what it is: domestic terrorism.	0
And it poses a threat to the United States of America.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We live in a country now where the president is advancing environmental racism, economic racism, criminal justice racism, health care racism.	0
The way we do better is to fight back and show something better.	0
So I have a plan, for example, on education that says we have to build a better education system for all our kids, but we've got to acknowledge what's happened on race.	0
So my plan has universal, tuition-free college for all of our kids, but also increases the Pell Grants and levels the playing field by putting $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
It cancels student loan debt for 95 percent of the kids with student loan debt and helps close the black-white wealth gap in America.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Senator, very much.	0
Mayor Buttigieg, you have been criticized for your handling of racial issues in your home city of South Bend, from diversity in the police force to housing policy.	0
Given your record, how can you convince African-Americans that you should be the Democratic nominee?	0
As an urban mayor serving a diverse community, the racial divide lives within me.	0
I'm not saying that I became mayor and racism or crime or poverty ended on my watch.	0
But in our city, we have come together repeatedly to tackle challenges, like the fact that far too many people were not getting the help they needed in their housing and so we directed it to a historically underinvested African-American neighborhood.	0
Right now, in the wake of a police-involved shooting, our community is moving from hurting to healing by making sure that the community can participate in things like revising the use of force policy and making sure there are community voices on the board of safety that handles police matters.	0
I've proposed a Douglass plan to tackle this issue nationally, because mayors have hit the limits of what you can do unless there is national action.	0
Systemic racism has touched every part of American life, from housing to health to homeownership.	0
If you walk into an emergency room and you are black, your reports of pain will be taken less seriously.	0
If you apply for a job and you are black, you are less likely to be called just because of the name on the resume.	0
It's why I've proposed that we do everything from investing in historically red-lined neighborhoods...	0
Mayor...	0
... to build black wealth in homeownership...	0
Thank you, Mayor.	0
... to supporting entrepreneurship for black Americans.	0
Thank you very much.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Klobuchar, what do you say to those Trump voters who prioritize the economy over the president's bigotry?	0
Well, first of all, there are people that voted for Donald Trump before that aren't racist; they just wanted a better shake in the economy.	0
And so I would appeal to them.	0
But I don't think anyone can justify what this president is doing.	0
Little kids literally woke up this weekend, turned on the TV, and saw their president calling their city, the town of Baltimore, nothing more than a home for rats.	0
And I can tell you, as your president, that will stop.	0
The second thing I would say is that economic opportunity means economic opportunity for everyone in this country.	0
I know that because I have lived it.	0
And that means when we put out there better childcare and better education, and we pay teachers more, and we make sure there's a decent retirement system in place, yes, we help the African-American community and we must, because they have been the ones that have been most hurt by what we've seen in the last decades, but we help everyone.	0
So what I say to the people in my rural parts of my state, just like I say to them in the city and bring them together, is that economic opportunity must be there for everyone.	0
Senator Klobuchar, thank you very much.	0
Congressman O'Rourke, please respond.	0
I want to acknowledge something that we're all touching on, which is the very foundation of this country, the wealth that we have built, the way we became the greatest country on the face of the planet was literally on the backs of those who were kidnapped and brought here by force.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
The legacy of slavery and segregation and Jim Crow and suppression is alive and well in every aspect of the economy and in the country.	0
Today, as president, I will sign into law a new Voting Rights Act.	0
I will focus on education, address health care disparities, but I will also sign into law Sheila Jackson Lee's reparations bill so that we can have the national conversation we've waited too long in this country to have.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Congressman O'Rourke.	0
Speaking of reparations, Ms. Williamson, many of your opponents support a commission to study the issue of reparations for slavery.	0
But you are calling for up to $500 billion in financial assistance.	0
What makes you qualified to determine how much is owed in reparations?	0
Well, first of all, it's not $500 billion in financial assistance.	0
It's $500 billion, $200 billion to $500 billion payment of a debt that is owed.	0
That is what reparations is.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We need some deep truth-telling when it comes.	0
We don't need another commission to look at evidence.	0
I appreciate what Congressman O'Rourke has said.	0
It is time for us to simply realize that this country will not heal.	0
All that a country is, is a collection of people.	0
People heal when there's some deep truth-telling.	0
We need to recognize that when it comes to the economic gap between blacks and whites in America, it does come from a great injustice that has never been dealt with.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
That great injustice has had to do with the fact that there was 250 years of slavery followed by another hundred years of domestic terrorism.	0
What makes me qualified to say $200 billion to $500 billion?	0
I’ll tell you what makes me qualified.	0
If you did the math of the 40 acres and a mule, given that there was 4 million to 5 million slaves at the end of the Civil War, four to five -- and they were all promised 40 acres and a mule for every family of four, if you did the math today, it would be trillions of dollars.	0
And I believe that anything less than $100 billion is an insult.	0
And I believe that $200 billion to $500 billion is politically feasible today, because so many Americans realize there is an injustice that continues to form a toxicity underneath the surface, an emotional turbulence that only reparations will heal.	0
Thank you very much.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Sanders -- Senator Sanders, you don't think cash payments are the best way to address this issue, but according to a new Gallup poll, 73 percent of African-Americans are in favor of cash payments to black Americans who are descendants of slaves.	0
How do you respond to them?	0
Well, I respond to that by saying that I am supportive of Jim Clyburn's legislation, which is called 10-20-30.	0
And what that understands is that as a result of slavery, and segregation, and the institutional racism we see now in health care, in education, in financial services, we are going to have to focus big time on rebuilding distressed communities in America, including African-American communities.	0
In terms of education, I also have a plan.	0
It's called the Thurgood Marshall Plan.	0
And it would focus on ending the growth of segregated schools in America.	0
It would triple funding for Title I schools.	0
It would make sure that teachers in this country earned at least $60,000 a year.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Sanders, thank you very much.	0
The debate continues right after this short break.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate, live from Detroit.	0
Let's turn now to the economy.	0
Congressman Ryan, President Trump's tariffs have boosted the U.S. steel industry but hurt auto manufacturers like those here in Michigan, which could drive up the cost of cars.	0
As president, would you continue President Trump's steel tariffs?	0
Look, I think President Trump was onto something when he talked about China.	0
China has been abusing the economic system for a long time.	0
They steal intellectual property.	0
They subsidize goods coming into this country.	0
They've displaced steel workers, auto workers, across the board, eroded our manufacturing.	0
And we basically transferred our wealth of our middle class either up to the top 1 percent or to China for them to build their military.	0
So I think we need some targeted response against China.	0
But you know how you beat China?	0
You out-compete 'em.	0
And that's why I'd put a chief manufacturing officer in place to make sure that we rebuild the manufacturing base.	0
We've got to fill these factories that -- in Detroit, in Youngstown, that used to make cars and steel.	0
We've got to fill them with workers who are making electric vehicles, batteries, charging stations, make sure they're making solar panels.	0
As I said earlier, China dominates 60 percent of the solar panel market.	0
They dominate 50 percent to 60 percent of the electric vehicle market.	0
We're going to make 10 million electric vehicle somewhere in the world in the next 10 years.	0
I want them made in the United States.	0
That's why I have a chief manufacturing officer that will sit in the White House and help drive this agenda.	0
Congressman, thank you.	0
Just as a point of clarification, as president, would you consider President Trump's steel tariffs, yes or no?	0
Well, I would have to re-evaluate.	0
I think some of them are effective.	0
But he's bungled the whole thing, obviously.	0
He has -- see, here's the problem with President Trump.	0
He has a tactical move -- one of many -- he has a tactical move.	0
What's the grand strategy for the United States?	0
China has 100-year plan, a 50-year plan, a 30-year plan, a 20-year plan.	0
We live in a 24-hour news cycle.	0
That spells disaster for our economy and disaster for our global politics.	0
Thank you, Congressman.	0
Congressman Delaney, your response?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
So, listen.	0
This is what I don’t understand.	0
President Trump wants to build physical walls and beats up on immigrants.	0
Most of the folks running for president want to build economic walls to free trade and beat up on President Obama.	0
I’m the only one running for president who actually supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership.	0
President Obama was right about that.	0
We should be getting back in that.	0
Senator Warren just issued a trade plan...	0
You bet I did.	0
... that would prevent the United States from trading with its allies.	0
We can't go and -- we can't isolate ourselves from the world.	0
We have to engage...	0
Thank you.	0
... with fair, rules-based trade.	0
Thank you, Congressman Delaney.	0
Senator Warren, please respond.	0
You know, for decades, we have had a trade policy that has been written by giant multi-national corporations to help giant multi-national corporations.	0
They have no loyalty to America.	0
They have no patriotism.	0
If they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico, they'll do it in a heartbeat.	0
If they can continue a polluting plant by moving it to Vietnam, they'll do it in a heartbeat.	0
I have put out a new comprehensive plan that says we're not going to do it that way.	0
We're going to negotiate our deals with unions at the table, with small businesses at the table, with small farmers at the table, with environmentalists at the table, with human rights activists at the table.	0
And then, we're going to use the fact that everybody in the world wants to get to America's markets.	0
They want to sell to you...	0
That was the TPP.	0
I'll finish.	0
Congressman Delaney...	0
... is everyone wants to get to America's markets.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
No.	0
So the question is...	0
Senator, thank you.	0
Please abide by the rules.	0
... how we need to raise our standards.	0
Congressman Delaney, it's your turn.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Congressman Delaney?	0
So that was the Trans-Pacific Partnership.	0
I think President Obama was right.	0
He did include environmental standards.	0
He did include labor standards.	0
We would be in an entirely different position with China if we had entered the Trans-Pacific Partnership.	0
We can't isolate ourselves from the world.	0
We can't isolate ourselves from Asia.	0
Senator Warren's plan, basically, that she put out, we would not be able to trade with the United Kingdom.	0
No, what this is about...	0
We would not be able to trade with the E.U.	0
It is so extreme that it will isolate...	0
Thank you, Congressman Delaney.	0
Thank you, Congressman.	0
... the American economy from the world.	0
Senator?	0
Senator Warren.	0
Senator Warren.	0
I was...	0
I think he said...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Senator Sanders, please let Senator Warren respond.	0
Oh, I'm sorry.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
What the congressman is describing as extreme is having deals that are negotiated by American workers for American workers.	0
American workers want those jobs, and we can build the trade deals that do it.	0
People want access to our markets all around the world.	0
Then the answer is, let's make them raise their standards.	0
Make them pay workers more.	0
Let their workers unionize.	0
Raise their environmental standards before they come to us and say they want to be able to sell their products.	0
Right now, the whole game is working for the big multinationals.	0
It's just not working for the people here in the United States, and we can change that.	0
Senator, thank you very much.	0
Congressman O'Rourke, your response?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
You know, the question was about tariffs.	0
And they're a huge mistake.	0
They constitute the largest tax increase on the American consumer, hitting the middle class and the working poor especially hard, and farmers in Iowa and across the country are bearing the brunt of the consequences.	0
When have we ever gone to war, including a trade war, without allies and friends and partners?	0
As president, we will hold China accountable, but we will bring our allies and friends, like the European Union, to bear, and we'll also negotiate trade deals that favor farmers and American workers and protect human rights and the environment and labor, not just here in the United States...	0
Congressman O'Rourke, thank you so much.	0
Senator Sanders, please respond to Congressman O'Rourke.	0
I'd like to respond to this.	0
Yeah, OK. You're looking, I believe, at the only member of Congress who not only voted against these disastrous trade agreements, NAFTA, PNTR with China, which cost us over 4 million jobs, but also helped lead the effort against these agreements.	0
Now, Elizabeth is absolutely right.	0
If anybody here thinks that corporate America gives one damn about the average American worker, you're mistaken.	0
If they can save five cents by going to China, Mexico, or Vietnam, or anyplace else, that's exactly what they will do.	0
As president, let me tell you what I will do.	0
These guys line up at the federal trough.	0
They want military contracts.	0
They want all kinds of contracts.	0
Well, under my administration, you ain't going to get those contracts if you're throwing American workers out on the street.	0
Senator Sanders, thank you very much.	0
Governor Hickenlooper, your response?	0
I'd like a chance to respond.	0
So -- so I think -- again, I think Congressman Delaney has got a point here.	0
And there is a way of looking at trade that is therapeutic.	0
The bottom line is, you talk to any economist, there is not a single example in history where a trade war had a winner.	0
Trade wars are for losers.	0
And the bottom line is we've got to recognize, let's negotiate a better trade deal.	0
But you're not going to win against China in a trade war when they've got 25 percent of our total debt.	0
And step back and look it.	0
Here's Trump gives a giant tax cut and at the same time -- so we're paying in tariffs about $800 to $1,200 per household and then we give this incredible tax cut to the rich.	0
Essentially what's happening is now he's transferred that tax obligation onto the middle class.	0
That's what's outrageous.	0
But tariffs are not the solution.	0
Governor, thank you.	0
Senator Warren?	0
Anyone who thinks that these trade deals are mostly about tariffs just doesn’t understand what’s going on.	0
Look at the new NAFTA 2.0.	0
What’s the central feature?	0
It’s to help pharmaceutical companies get longer periods of exclusivity so they can charge Canadians, Americans, and Mexicans more money and make more profits.	0
That's what trade deals have become.	0
They have become a way for giant multinationals to change the regulatory environment so they can suck more profits out for themselves and to leave the American people behind.	0
We have to have the courage to fight back against that corruption.	0
Senator, thank you.	0
Governor Bullock, your response?	0
You know, a farmer in Rippy said to me, every time that Trump tweets, we lose hundreds of thousands of dollars.	0
If Montana had to eat all the wheat that we produce, every Montanan would have to eat 40 loaves of bread a day.	0
But by the same token, what we have is -- I actually agree with Senator Warren on this in part.	0
Corporations can move capital easy.	0
Workers can't move.	0
So going forward, we need to make sure that our trade deals actually are protecting -- thinking about the workers.	0
They can't be the stepchild.	0
But the way to do it, with this blunt instrument of tariffs that the president is doing, that's not how we get a fair deal for farmers anywhere or the manufacturers here in Detroit.	0
Governor, thank you very much.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Mayor -- standby, please.	0
Standby, please.	0
Please abide by the rules.	0
Mayor Buttigieg, on Thursday of this week, a GM plant in Michigan will stop production, the latest auto plant to cease operations in the industrial Midwest.	0
This comes as part of the company's modernization plans, which will eventually result in 6,000 hourly workers losing their jobs or being reassigned to other plants.	0
What is your plan for retraining workers whose jobs are at risk?	0
Well, this happened in my community 20 years before I was born.	0
And when I was growing up, we were still picking up the pieces.	0
Empty factories, empty houses, poverty.	0
I know exactly what happens to a community when these closures take place.	0
And there will be more.	0
It's why we actually need to put the interests of workers first.	0
Of course we need to do retraining.	0
We're doing it now in South Bend.	0
We should continue to do it.	0
But this is so much bigger than a trade fight.	0
This is about a moment when the economy is changing before our eyes.	0
There are people in the gig economy who go through more jobs in a week than my parents went through in their lifetime.	0
It's why I've proposed that we allow gig workers to unionize, because a gig is a job and a worker is a worker.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Mayor.	0
We have to respond to all of these changes.	0
And, you know, in addition to confronting tech, in addition to supporting workers by double unionization, as I propose to do, some of this is low-tech, too, like the minimum wage is just too low.	0
And so-called conservative Christian senators right now in the Senate are blocking a bill to raise the minimum wage, when scripture says that whoever oppresses the poor taunts their maker.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Mayor, thank you very much.	0
Congressman Delaney, I'm coming to you now.	0
Your estimated net worth is more than $65 million.	0
That would make you subject to Senator Warren's proposed wealth tax on the assets of the richest 75,000 homes, households, or so, in the United States.	0
Do you think Senator Warren's wealth tax is a fair way to fund child care and education?	0
I think wealthy Americans have to pay more.	0
Listen, I grew up in a blue-collar family.	0
First in my family to go to college.	0
Became a successful entrepreneur.	0
Created thousands of jobs.	0
Supported thousands of entrepreneurs all around this country.	0
And I've done well financially.	0
I think I should pay more in tax.	0
I think wealthy Americans should pay more in tax.	0
But we have to have a real solution.	0
The real solution is to raise the capital gains rates.	0
There is no reason why people who invest for a living should pay less than people who work for a living.	0
That’s ridiculous.	0
It’s the biggest loophole in our tax code.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We act like wealthy individuals are endangered species and if we don't raise -- if we raise their taxes, they won't invest.	0
That's crazy.	0
That's how we get more revenues from wealthy individuals, we roll back the Trump tax cuts to wealthy individuals.	0
I think the wealth tax will be fought in court forever.	0
It's arguably unconstitutional.	0
And the countries that have had it have largely abandoned it because it's impossible to implement.	0
But here again, real solutions, not impossible promises.	0
Congressman, thank you very much.	0
Raise the capital gains tax.	0
Roll back the taxes on wealthy Americans.	0
Thank you, Congressman.	0
That we can do in our first few months as president.	0
Senator Warren, please respond.	0
So I have proposed a wealth tax.	0
It's now time to do that.	0
It's time to tax the top one tenth of one percent of fortunes in this country.	0
Your first $50 million, you can keep free and clear.	0
But your 50 millionth and first dollar, you got to pitch in two cents.	0
Two cents.	0
What can America do with two cents?	0
We can provide universal childcare from zero to five.	1
We can provide universal pre-K for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old.	1
We can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in this country.	1
We can provide universal tuition-free college.	1
We can expand Pell.	0
We can put $50 billion into our historically black colleges and universities.	0
And we can cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of the people who have it and start to close the wealth gap in America.	0
It tells you how badly broken this economy is...	0
Senator, thank you very much.	0
Congressman Delaney...	0
... that two cents from the wealthiest in this country...	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
... would let us invest in the rest of America.	0
Senator, please.	0
Congressman, please respond.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
This is not about whether wealthy -- this is not about whether wealthy Americans should pay more.	0
I think we're all in agreement on that.	0
It's a question of, do you have a real solution to make it happen?	0
We can raise the capital gains rate to match the ordinary income.	0
You know the last president to do that was actually Ronald Reagan.	0
We can do that in our first year.	0
I've called for that to be done (inaudible).	0
I've called for the expansion of universal pre-K so that every American has pre-K. And I do it through a -- through an additional tax on high net worth individuals.	0
Thank you.	0
But we don't need to come up with new taxes that are arguably unconstitutional...	0
Thank you, Congressman Delaney.	0
... will be fought in court for years.	0
Thank you, Congressman.	0
I want to turn to the issue of student debt.	0
This is...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Can I just respond to that?	0
I'm going to turn to the issue of student debt now.	0
Mayor Buttigieg, you've talked about how you and your husband are...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... paying down six figures of student loan debt.	0
Under Senator Sanders' proposal to cancel all student loan debt, yours would immediately be wiped away.	0
Why wouldn't you support that?	0
That would be great for us.	0
And then the next day, there would be a student loan program and people would be out taking student loans wondering they weren't -- why they weren't lucky enough in timing to get theirs wiped away completely, too.	0
We can have debt-free college for low and middle-income students by expanding Pell Grants and compelling states to pick up more of the burden.	0
And on the back end, for those of us who do have a lot of debt, we can make it more affordable and we can expand a public service loan forgiveness program, which is an excellent program that is almost impossible to actually get access to right now.	0
We can take these steps and have an approach that is actually fair.	0
If we want to start wiping away student debt, here's where I would start.	0
I would start with the for-profit colleges that took advantage of people, especially veterans, by the way.	0
The moment I redeployed, my Facebook add feed started filling with ads from these for-profit colleges.	0
Under President Obama, they were held accountable for whether they delivered results.	0
President Trump, under a secretary of education who regrettably is from this state, did away with those rules.	0
There's no accountability.	0
On my watch, those colleges that turned the Department of Education into a predatory lender, that's where we would begin when it came to getting rid of loans.	0
Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.	0
Senator Sanders, you want to forgive all student loan debt.	0
Your response?	0
Matter of fact, I do.	0
But before I get into that, the major issue that we don't talk about in Congress; you don't talk about in the media, is the massive level of income and wealth inequality in America.	0
You’ve got three people who own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent.	0
You have a top 1 percent that owns more wealth than the bottom 92 percent.	0
Forty-nine percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent.	0
Companies like Amazon and billionaires out there do not pay one nickel in federal income tax.	0
And we’ve got 500,000 people sleeping out on the street.	0
What we need is a political revolution that tells these billionaires and corporate America that they are Americans; they'll participate in our society, but they have got to start paying their fair share of taxes, period.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Senator Sanders.	0
Ms. Williamson?	0
I'd like to respond.	0
You are proposing to make college free for all qualified students.	0
Should the government pay for children from wealthier families to go to college?	0
I think that all domestic and international policy should be based on the idea that anything we do to help people thrive is a stimulation to our economy.	0
That’s how you stimulate your economy.	0
So if a few people take advantage, but there are four or five people who were going to take the money that they then have in the bank -- when you look at this $1.5 trillion college debt -- this is why I agree with Bernie, or I would be -- OK, why don’t we swap it?	0
We had a $2 trillion tax cut, where 83 cents of every dollar goes to the very, very richest among us, that does not stimulate the economy.	0
If we get rid of this college debt, think of all the young people who will have the discretionary spending; they'll be able to start their business.	0
The best thing you could do to stimulate the U.S. economy is to get rid of this debt.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
This is not just about a plan to to do it.	0
It’s about a philosophy of governing.	0
And I’ve heard some people here tonight, I almost wonder why you’re Democrats.	0
You seem to think there’s something wrong about using...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... about using the instruments of government to help people.	0
That is what government should do.	0
It should -- all policies should help people thrive.	0
That is how we will have peace...	0
Thank you.	0
... and that is how we will have prosperity.	0
Thank you, Ms. Williamson.	0
Congressman O'Rourke, you don't support free four-year college.	0
Your response to Ms. Williamson?	0
I support free two-year college, earn that associate's degree, realize your full potential, debt-free four-year college.	0
But unlike some of the other candidates on the stage, that's not just for tuition.	0
That is room and books and board, the full cost of being able to better yourself so that you can better this country, and then for that schoolteacher who, in many places like Texas, is working a second or a third job, full forgiveness for her outstanding student loan debt, forgiveness for that person willing to work at the V.A.	0
and serve our former service members.	0
And we do not do that at the expense of unions.	0
We elevate them as well and make it easier to join an apprenticeship to learn a skill or a trade that you can command for the rest of your life.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, Congressman.	0
Senator Klobuchar, your response?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I want to make it easier for kids to go to college.	0
And I think we do it by focusing our resources on the people that need it most.	0
And my problem with some of these plans is they literally would pay for wealthy kids, for Wall Street kids to go to college.	0
There's no difference.	0
It says everyone is free.	0
I don't think that makes sense.	0
And I'm very concerned if we do things like that, the debt we're going to pass on to the next generation and the next generation.	0
So what I would do about student loan debt is that I would allow people to refinance it at a better rate and I would make sure that we improve those student loan repayment programs for our teachers and expand them so that you literally -- over 5, 10 years -- can get it paid for if you go into occupations where we don't have enough workers.	0
I think we need to mesh what we were just talking about with the economy with our education policy.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
I want to turn to foreign policy now.	0
"Senator Sanders, President Trump has argued that the United States cannot continue to be the, quote, ""policeman of the world."""	0
You said the exact same thing on a debate stage in 2016.	0
If voters are hearing the same message from you and President Trump on the issue of military intervention, how should they expect that you will be any different from him?	0
Trump is a pathological liar.	0
I tell the truth.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We have been in Afghanistan I think 18 years, in Iraq 16 or 17 years.	0
We have spent $5 trillion on the war on terror.	0
And there are probably more terrorists out there now than before it began.	0
We're going to spend -- the Congress passed -- and I will not vote for -- a $715 billion military budget, more than the 10 next countries combined.	0
What we need is a foreign policy that focuses on diplomacy, ending conflicts by people sitting at a table, not by killing each other.	0
As president of the United States, I will go to the United Nations and not denigrate it, not attack the U.N., but bring countries together in the Middle East and all over the world to come to terms with their differences and solve those problems peacefully.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
The United States cannot be the policeman of the world.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Governor Hickenlooper, how do you respond to Senator Sanders' vision for America's role in the world?	0
Well, we share the recognition of the incredible costs.	0
People don't realize that half the soldiers that fought in Iraq and Afghanistan were National Guard.	0
And so I went and sent them off on their deployments, big, you know, noisy hangers, but I also mourned with their families when they didn't come back.	0
We are able now to -- I call it constant engagement.	0
But we should have an international diplomatic approach where we're talking to everybody, because if we're going to deal with climate change and cyber security and nuclear proliferation, we've got to be talking to everybody.	0
And tariff wars don't work.	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
They're for losers.	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
I want to go to Congressman Ryan and I want to turn to the subject of North Korea, which just hours ago launched two short-range ballistic missiles for the second time in less than a week.	0
Congressman, you've said that you would not meet with North Korea dictator Kim Jong-un unless you were at least close to a deal.	0
"Now, Senator Klobuchar says that she would, quote, ""always be willing to meet with leaders to discuss policies."""	0
Is that view wrong?	0
Yeah, I think so.	0
I love Amy Klobuchar, but I think she's wrong on this one.	0
I don't think presidents of the United States meet with dictators.	0
We saw what just happened with President Trump.	0
He goes to the demilitarized zone with the leader of North Korea, gives him a huge photo op, gives him global credibility, because the most powerful person in the world is sitting there meeting with him, and weeks later, he’s lobbing more missiles.	0
That doesn’t make any sense.	0
We've got to demilitarize our foreign policy.	0
We've got to make sure that we are engaging these countries all the time.	0
This is very difficult work.	0
I've been in Congress 17 years.	0
I've sat on the Defense Appropriations Committee.	0
I've sat on the Armed Services Committee.	0
This is long, tedious work, much of it done outside of the eye of the TV camera.	0
And as president, you've got to monitor that and be very disciplined every day.	0
Don't go give a dictator a huge win.	0
Sit down and do your job.	0
And the same thing with what's happening in Central America.	0
He's cutting the State Department budget, Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, where the migrants are coming from.	0
Thank you, Congressman.	0
Go fix the problem at its source and use diplomacy to do it.	0
Senator Klobuchar, your response?	0
I think we agree.	0
I just think you have to leave open the possibility of meeting with anyone at any place.	0
What I don't like is how this president has handled it.	0
You've heard of the Truman doctrine, the Monroe doctrine.	0
He's done the go-it-alone doctrine with the rest of the world.	0
He's taking us out of the climate change agreement, out of the Iran nuclear agreement, out of the Russian nuclear agreement, and I don't agree with that.	0
And when he was just with Vladimir Putin at the G20, when he was asked about invading our democracy, he made a joke.	0
Hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost their lives on the battlefield to protect our democracy and our right to vote.	0
Thank you.	0
Four little girls in Birmingham, Alabama, lost their life in a church at the height of the civil rights amendment.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
So I do believe you meet with people, but you'd better have an agenda...	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
... and you better put our interests of our country first, not the Russians'.	0
Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.	0
Mayor Buttigieg, you served in Afghanistan where just yesterday two U.S. servicemembers were killed.	0
There are currently about 14,000 U.S. servicemembers in Afghanistan.	0
"You've said, quote, ""One thing everybody can agree on is that we're getting out of Afghanistan."""	0
Will you withdraw all U.S. servicemembers by the end of your first year in office?	0
We will withdraw.	0
We have to.	0
In your first year?	0
Yes.	0
Look, around the world, we will do whatever it takes to keep America safe.	0
But I thought I was one of the last troops leaving Afghanistan when I thought I was turning out the lights years ago.	0
Every time I see news about somebody being killed in Afghanistan, I think about what it was like to hear an explosion over there and wonder whether it was somebody that I served with, somebody that I knew, a friend, roommate, colleague.	0
We're pretty close to the day when we will wake up to the news of a casualty in Afghanistan who was not born on 9/11.	0
I was sent into that war by a congressional authorization, as well as a president.	0
And we need to talk not only about the need for a president committed to ending endless war, but the fact that Congress has been asleep at the switch.	0
And on my watch, I will propose that any authorization for the use of military force have a three-year sunset and have to be renewed, because if men and women in the military have the courage to go serve, members of Congress ought to have to summon the courage to vote on whether they ought to be there.	0
Thank you, Mayor.	0
Thank you, Mayor.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I want to bring in Congressman O'Rourke.	0
Congressman O'Rourke, responding -- returning, rather, to the question of whether you would withdraw all U.S. servicemembers from Afghanistan during your first year in office as president, how do you respond, sir?	0
I would in my first term in office.	0
Agree that there is nothing about perpetuating this war, already in its 18th year, that will make it any better.	0
We've satisfied the reasons for our involvement in Afghanistan in the first place.	0
And it's time to bring those servicemembers back home from Afghanistan, but also from Iraq, also from Yemen, and Somalia, and Libya, and Syria.	0
There is no reason for us to be at war all over the world tonight.	0
As president, I will end those wars, and we will not start new wars.	0
We will not send more U.S. servicemembers overseas to sacrifice their lives and to take the lives of others in our name.	0
We can resolve these challenges peacefully and diplomatically.	0
Thank you, Congressman.	0
Thank you, Congressman.	0
Governor Hickenlooper, you disagree.	0
You've said that you're open to keeping some servicemembers in Afghanistan beyond your first term.	0
I look at it as a...	0
Please respond.	0
... humanitarian issue.	0
And with all due respect, you're looking at the condition of women...	0
Thank you.	0
... if we completely pull our troops out of there, you're going to see a humanitarian disaster that will startle and frighten every man, woman, and child in this country.	0
And I don't think -- I mean, we have troops in over 400 different locations around the world.	0
Most of them are small, they're peacekeeping, they're not greatly at risk.	0
We’re going to have to be in Afghanistan.	0
Look at the progress that’s happened in that country.	0
We’re going to turn our backs and walk away from people that have risked their lives to help us and build a different future for Afghanistan and that part of the world?	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
Senator Warren, you want to make it U.S. policy that the U.S. will never use a nuclear weapon unless another country uses one first.	0
Now, President Obama reportedly considered that policy, but ultimately decided against it.	0
Why should the U.S. tie its own hands with that policy?	0
Because it makes the world safer.	0
The United States is not going to use nuclear weapons preemptively, and we need to say so to the entire world.	0
It reduces the likelihood that someone miscalculates, someone misunderstands.	0
Our first responsibility is to keep ourselves safe.	0
And what's happening right now with Donald Trump is they keep expanding the different ways that we have nuclear weapons, the different ways that they could be used puts us all at risk.	0
You know, we talk about what’s happening around the world.	0
I have three older brothers who served in the military.	0
I see that they would do anything.	0
Our military is the best on Earth.	0
But we should not be asking our military to take on jobs that do not have a military solution.	0
We need to use our diplomatic tools, our economic tools, and if we’re going to send someone into war, we better have a plan for how we’re going to get them out on the other end.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Governor Bullock, your response to Senator Warren's proposal to the U.S. never use a nuclear weapon first?	0
I wouldn't want to take that off the table.	0
I think America's strength -- we have to be able to say that.	0
Look, never, I hope, certainly in my term or anyone else, would we really even get close to pulling that trigger.	0
But by the same token, America's strength -- and, look, this president has made America first as America alone.	0
Our allies no longer trust us.	0
Our adversaries are with us.	0
But going from the position of strength, we should be negotiating down so there aren't nuclear weapons.	0
But drawing those lines in the sand, at this point I wouldn't do.	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
Senator Warren.	0
your response?	0
"Look, we don't expand trust around the world by saying, ""You know, we might be the first ones to use a nuclear weapon."""	0
That puts the entire world at risk and puts us at risk, right in the middle of this.	0
At a time when Donald Trump is pulling out of our nuclear negotiations, expanding the opportunities for nuclear proliferation around the world, has pulled us out of the deal in Iran, and Iran is now working on its nuclear weapon, the world gets closer and closer to nuclear warfare.	0
Senator, that...	0
We have to have an announced policy that is one the entire world can live with.	0
We need to make that clear.	0
We will respond if someone else does, but not first.	0
Governor Bullock, please respond.	0
Part, I agree with.	0
But by the same token, like, we need to get back to nuclear proliferation.	0
Why?	0
But when you have folks -- de-proliferation, reducing it.	0
"But at the same time, when you actually have Korea; when you have others, I don't want to turn around and say, ""Well, Detroit has to be gone before we would ever use that."""	0
When so many crazy folks are getting closer to having a nuclear weapon, I don't want them to think I could strike this country and I and we as the United States of America wouldn't do a thing.	0
Part of the strength really is the ability to deter.	0
Governor Bullock...	0
So...	0
Governor, thank you very much.	0
Moving on now...	0
Could I add something to that...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Senator, please -- moving on now.	0
As you know, to serve as president of the United States -- all of you know this -- you have to be at least 35 years old.	0
So Mayor Buttigieg, you just qualified.	0
You're 37, the youngest candidate in this field.	0
Standing next to you is the oldest candidate, Bernie Sanders, at age 77.	0
Should voters take into consideration age when choosing a presidential candidate?	0
I don't care how old you are.	0
I care about your vision.	0
But I do think it matters that we have a new generation of leaders stepping up around the world, leaders like the...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I actually think it's good that the prime minister of New Zealand's gotten a lot of attention in Democratic debates.	0
She's masterful.	0
She is younger than I would be when I take office.	0
This is the kind of trend America might be leading, instead of following, but only if it's actually backed by the right vision.	0
And we can have great presidents at any age.	0
What I will say is we need the kind of vision that's going to win.	0
We cannot have a vision that amounts to back to normal.	0
Because the only reason we got this president is that normal didn't work.	0
We have to be ready to take on this president and, by the way, something that hasn't been talked about as much tonight, take on his enablers in Congress.	0
You know, when...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... when David Duke -- when David Duke ran for Congress -- ran for governor, the Republican Party, 20 years ago, ran away from him.	0
Today they are supporting naked racism in the White House, or at best silent about it.	0
And if you are watching this at home and you are a Republican member of Congress, consider the fact that, when the sun sets on your career and they are writing your story, of all the good and bad things you did in your life, the thing you will be remembered for is whether, in this moment, with this president, you found the courage to stand up to him or you continued to put party over country.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Mayor.	0
Senator Sanders, as the senior statesman of the group, please respond to Mayor Buttigieg.	0
Well, Pete is right.	0
It's a question of vision.	0
That's what it is, whether you're young, whether you're old, whether you're in between.	0
And my vision, among other things, says that if we're going to fight for health care, we don't take money from the drug companies or the insurance companies.	0
And I have asked all of the candidates who are running to say they will not accept money from those entities who, in my view, are going to war against the American people in terms of health care.	0
That's a new vision.	0
A new vision says that we must cancel completely student debt because the younger generation in this country today, for the first time in modern American history, will have a lower standard of living than their parents.	0
Thank you, Senator Sanders.	0
I'd like to respond on that, too.	0
The debate continues right after this -- please.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Thank you.	0
The debate continues right after this short break.	0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
Welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debates.	0
We have covered a lot of ground tonight.	0
Now it is time for closing statements.	0
You will each receive one minute.	0
Governor Bullock, we're going to begin with you.	0
Thanks, Jake.	0
I was raised in a single-parent household, at times paycheck to paycheck.	0
Only knew there was a governor's house in town because I delivered newspapers to it, so I've made it about four blocks in life.	0
Worked my way through college, paid my way through law school.	0
But, you know, I had a chance to actually go from delivering newspapers to the governor's house as a kid to now raising our three kids in it.	0
We got to recognize for far too many people now in America that shot no longer exists.	0
And for far too many in this country, it never has.	0
I'm running for president to beat Donald Trump, win back the places we lost, and make sure that Americans know that where Washington has left them behind in the economy, in the political system, I'll be there.	0
This isn't a choice just between center and left or about -- we don't have to choose between what we don't want and what we can't afford.	0
Folks want a different way.	0
They want to believe the economy and our democracy can work for us.	0
That's why I'm running for president.	0
Thank you.	0
Ms. Williamson?	0
Yes, our problem is not just that we need to defeat Donald Trump.	0
We need a plan to solve institutionalized hatred, collectivized hatred, and white nationalism.	0
And in order to do that, we need more than political insider game and wonkiness and intellectual argument.	0
Those things will not defeat Donald Trump.	0
We need some radical truth-telling, not just to talk about health care, but talk about why are we so sick all the time.	0
We need to have a serious conversation about race and what is truly owed.	0
Even on the subject of foreign policy, it's all about symptoms and not about cause.	0
We need to talk about the fact that the United States has sacrificed our moral leadership.	0
The fact that countries see us, not only domestically but internationally, with policies that simply support our corporate overlords.	0
The fact that our national defense agenda is driven more by short-term profits for defense contractors than by genuine peace-building.	0
There's some corruption that is so deep, ladies and gentlemen.	0
And until the Democratic Party is ready to speak to the deeper corruption, knowing that we ourselves sometimes because of our own corporate donations have participated, than I'm afraid those who vote for Trump will continue to vote for Trump and those who might not like Donald Trump will continue to stay home.	0
I want a politics that goes much deeper.	0
I want a politics that speaks to the heart, because the only way to fight -- you keep talking about how we're going to fight Donald Trump.	0
You can't fight dog whistles.	0
You have to override them.	0
And the only way you can override them is with new voices, voices of energy that only come from the fact that America has been willing to live up to our own mistakes, atone for our mistakes, make amends for our own mistakes, love each other, love our democracy, love future generations, something emotional and psychological that will not be -- be emerging from anything on this stage.	0
It will emerge from something I'm the one who's qualified to bring forth.	0
Congressman Delaney?	0
Thank you, Jake.	0
John F. Kennedy famously said we should not seek the Republican answer, we should not seek the Democratic answer, we should seek the right answer.	0
He was right when he said it and he's right today, as well.	0
Donald Trump is the symptom of a disease.	0
And the disease is divisiveness.	0
And I'm the only one on the stage talking about curing that disease, which -- with big ideas like national service, by focusing on actually solving problems.	0
If we work together, we can fix health care and build infrastructure.	0
We can invest in not just technology, but people and entrepreneurs, whether they be in Storm Lake, Iowa, or Detroit, Michigan, or Baltimore, Maryland.	0
We can fight climate change and reimagine our education system.	0
But we have to do it with real solutions, not impossible promises.	0
Isn't it time we had a president who was a leader in both the private sector and in government, to lead us into the future?	0
I promise, as president, I will restore vision, unity, and leadership, and decency to this country.	0
And that's why I'm running for president.	0
Thank you.	0
Congressman Ryan?	0
So in a few minutes, all of the pundits are going to be looking at this debate and saying, well, who captured the left lane and who captured the center lane and who captured the moderate lane?	0
I hope tonight at some level I captured your imagination, your imagination about what this country could be like if we united, if we put together real policy that weren't left or right, but new and better.	0
That's how we win the future.	0
It's new and better.	0
A new and better economy, a new and better education system, a new and better health care system that focuses on prevention, an education system that focuses on the trauma of our kids.	0
There's not going to be a savior.	0
Not going to be a superstar that's going to fix all this.	0
It's going to be you and me.	0
It's going to be us.	0
That's how we fix this country, you and I coming together to do big things, to imagine the new country that we want by coming together, not left or right.	0
New and better.	0
Governor Hickenlooper?	0
Thank you.	0
And what a night.	0
I've loved it.	0
I'd like to ask every American to imagine that you are facing life-threatening surgery tomorrow.	0
Would you choose a doctor who had a track record of proven success, who'd actually done the work, or someone who had just talked about it?	0
That's the question we're facing in this primary.	0
I've actually got a track record as small-business owner, as a mayor, and as a governor.	0
We expanded health care in Colorado.	0
We got near universal coverage.	0
We fought climate change directly.	0
We beat the NRA.	0
And for the last three years, we've been the number-one economy in the country.	0
We can wrap all that out.	0
I'm as progressive as anybody up on this stage, but I'm also pragmatic.	0
And I've done the things that most of these other people are just talking about.	0
And I know I can get results.	0
And I can lead the people of this country towards a stronger, a healthier, and a more secure future, and defeat Donald Trump and return this country to its glory.	0
Thank you.	0
Senator Klobuchar?	0
Well, thank you, Detroit.	0
To win, we have to listen to people.	0
And out there today is Casey Jo's mom.	0
Casey Jo was a champion high school swimmer from a small town.	0
She got sick, went to the emergency room, and got hooked on opioids.	0
"The last thing that she said to her mom was, ""Mama, it's not my fault."""	0
And she died.	0
A lot of Americans say the same thing every day.	0
And that is what I will stand up for and what I will stand up against are companies like those pharma companies that got her hooked on those opioids and didn't tell the doctors or the patients what was going to happen.	0
We need someone that has people's back.	0
We also need someone that can win.	0
And I have won in these red districts.	0
I win in the Midwest.	0
I can win in states like Wisconsin and Michigan and Iowa.	0
I also will do my job without fear or favor, just like I did as a prosecutor, and get through the gridlock like I've done as a senator, where I've passed over 100 bills where I've been the lead Democrat.	0
And last, yes, I will govern with integrity.	0
We have a president where people turn off their TV when they see him.	0
Not me.	0
I will make you proud as your president.	0
Congressman O'Rourke?	0
We are as divided and polarized as a country as we have ever been.	0
And right now we have a president who uses fear to try to drive us further apart.	0
To meet this challenge, we have to have hope in one another and a faith in a future of the country that includes everyone.	0
My whole life, I've been including people in the success of this country, starting a small business with high-value, high-wage, high-skilled jobs in the third poorest urban county in America, serving on City Council and holding town hall meetings every single week to remind myself who it is that I serve at the end of the day, and in Congress, being in the minority but working with Democrats and Republicans alike to deliver for my constituents and this country.	0
And then in Texas, this last year, traveling to every county, not writing anybody off, not taking anyone for granted, and at the end of the day, winning more votes than any Democrat had in the history of the state, winning independents for the first time in decades, and winning nearly half-a-million Republicans, and those 38 Electoral College votes in Texas are now in play and I can win them.	0
That is how we defeat Donald Trump in November of 2020 and how we bring this divided country together again in January of 2021.	0
Thank you.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Mayor Buttigieg?	0
There's good news and bad news.	0
I'm going to start with the bad news.	0
Our country is in trouble.	0
GDP is going up and life expectancy is going down.	0
Think about what that means.	0
And it's only getting tougher.	0
By 2030, we will have passed the point of no return on climate, there are going to be 130 million more guns on our streets.	0
I'll be in my forties then.	0
If you have kids, think about how old they will be then.	0
It's not too late.	0
We can tell our kids that before we ran out of time, just before we ran out of time, in 2020, we did what it took to deliver a climate that we didn't have to wonder if it could support us, to deliver a society where race has no bearing on your health or your wealth or your relationship with law enforcement, that we did what it took to deliver an economy where a rising tide actually does lift all boats.	0
We can do this, if and only if we are ready to walk away from what hasn't worked with bold action and win, not only defeat this president, but defeat his congressional allies with a defeat so big that it reunites the Republican Party with its conscience as well as bringing Democrats to office.	0
Join me, and let's make it happen.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Warren?	0
From the time I was 7 years old, I had a dream.	0
I wanted to be a public schoolteacher.	0
But my daddy ended up as janitor.	0
And by the time I graduated from high school, my family didn't have the money to send me off to college.	0
My big chance was what was then a commuter college that cost $50 a semester.	0
For me, what this election is all about is opportunity.	0
Every budget, every policy that we talk about is about who's going to get opportunity.	0
Is it going to go to the billionaires?	0
Or is it going to go to our kids?	0
Right now, for decades, we have had a government that has been on the side of the rich and the powerful.	0
It has been on the side of the wealthy.	0
And that means it has not been on the side of everyone else, not on the side of people living on our Native American reservations, people living in inner cities, people living in small farms, and small communities across this country.	0
How do we beat it?	0
We beat it by being the party of big, structural change.	0
Give people a reason to show up and vote.	0
"And we beat it by building a grassroots movement across this country, not showing up behind closed doors with millionaires, but actually building it person by person across this country, with small-dollar donations, with volunteers, with people who show up and say, ""I have a stake in this democracy."""	0
I will not only beat Donald Trump in 2020, I'll start to make real change come 2021.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Sanders?	0
As somebody who grew up in family that lived in a rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York, and lived paycheck to paycheck, I'm running for president not just to defeat the most dangerous president in the history of this country, a guy who's a racist and a sexist and a homophobe.	0
I'm running to transform this country and to stand with the working class of America, which for the last 45 years has been decimated.	0
Two days ago, I had a remarkable experience which should tell you everything you need to know about what's going on in America.	0
I took 15 people with diabetes from Detroit a few miles into Canada, and we bought insulin for one-tenth the price being charged by the crooks who run the pharmaceutical industry in America today.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
But it's not just the price-fixing and the corruption and the greed of the pharmaceutical industry.	0
It's what's going on in the fossil fuel industry.	0
It's what's going on in Wall Street.	0
It's what's going on with the prison industrial complex.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We need a mass political movement.	0
Please go to	0
berniesanders.com .	0
Become one of our million volunteers.	0
Stand up and take on the greed and corruption of the ruling class of this country.	0
Let’s create a government and an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Candidates, thank you so much.	0
That completes tonight's debate.	0
Join us tomorrow night at 8:00 p.m. Eastern time for round two, 10 more Democratic candidates for president, right back here in Detroit.	0
Now stay tuned for special coverage of tonight’s debate with Anderson Cooper and Chris Cuomo.	0
That begins right now.	0
