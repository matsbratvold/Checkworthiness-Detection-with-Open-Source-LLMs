4,MADDOW,"Face-to-face, just one-on-one, just the two of them.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
5,TODD,And neither party has seen this yet.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
6,TODD,"These candidates are both running for the Democratic nomination, but they are very different from each other when it comes to what matters most and how they would go about the job of being president.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
7,TODD,"Our job tonight is to draw out those differences so you, the voters, can understand them and be fully informed.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
8,MADDOW,And we do hope that the candidates will take this opportunity to show us the distinctions -- show us the differences between them.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
9,MADDOW,That's the whole reason that we're here tonight.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
10,MADDOW,We're not here for talking points.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
11,MADDOW,We're to learn about the difference between the candidates.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
12,MADDOW,"And with that, let's get going.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
13,MADDOW,Please join us in welcoming Secretary Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
14,SYSTEM,(APPLAUSE),0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv

16,TODD,"The rules tonight, by the way, are simple",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
17,TODD,"90 seconds for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
18,MADDOW,"And with that, that's it.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
19,MADDOW,We're going to begin with 60- second opening statements from each of the candidates.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
20,MADDOW,"And as agreed to in advance by the two campaigns, we're going to begin tonight with Senator Sanders.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
21,SANDERS,"Rachel, thank you very much.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
22,SANDERS,Millions of Americans are giving up on the political process.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
23,SANDERS,And they're giving up on the political process because they understand the economy is rigged.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
24,SANDERS,They are working longer hours for low wages.,1,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
25,SANDERS,"They're worried about the future of their kids, and yet almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent.",1,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
26,SANDERS,Not what America is supposed to be about.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
27,SANDERS,Not the fairness that we grew up believing that America was about.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
28,SANDERS,"And then sustaining that rigged economy is a corrupt campaign finance system undermining American democracy, where billionaire, Wall Street, corporate America can contribute unlimited sums of money into super PACs and into candidates.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
29,SANDERS,"Our job, together, is to end a rigged economy, create an economy that works for all, and absolutely overturn Citizens United.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
30,SANDERS,"One person, one vote.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
31,SANDERS,That's what American democracy is about.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
32,TODD,"Thank you, Senator.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
33,TODD,Secretary Clinton.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
34,CLINTON,"Well, I'm happy to be here in New Hampshire for this debate, as we move toward the primary on Tuesday.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
35,CLINTON,"I believe that America has the opportunity to once again live by our values, live up to our values in the 21st century, but I think that America can only do that if Americans can succeed.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
36,CLINTON,And there are lots of reasons why Americans today are feeling left out and left behind.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
37,CLINTON,"Yes, of course, the economy has not been working for most Americans.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
38,CLINTON,"Yes, of course, we have special interests that are unfortunately doing too much to rig the game.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
39,CLINTON,"But there's also the continuing challenges of racism, of sexism, of discrimination against the LGBT community, of the way that we treat people as opposed to how we want to be treated.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
40,CLINTON,I believe that we can get back on the right track.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
41,CLINTON,"I want to imagine a country where people's wages reflect their hard work, where we have healthcare for everyone, and where every child gets to live up to his or her potential.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
42,CLINTON,"I'm fighting for people who cannot wait for those changes, and I'm not making promises that I cannot keep.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
43,TODD,All right.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
44,TODD,Let's get started.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
45,TODD,"Secretary Clinton, last night you cited the Concord Monitor when you said of Senator Sanders that, quote, ""It's very hard to see how any of his proposals could ever be achievable.""",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
46,TODD,"So please tell us why you think if he's elected president on a platform of promising things like free public college and universal healthcare, that he cannot achieve those things.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
47,CLINTON,"Well, let me start by saying that Senator Sanders and I share some very big progressive goals.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
48,CLINTON,"I've been fighting for universal healthcare for many years, and we're now on the path to achieving it.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
49,CLINTON,I don't want us to start over again.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
50,CLINTON,"I think that would be a great mistake, to once again plunge our country into a contentious debate about whether we should have and what kind of system we should have for healthcare.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
51,CLINTON,I want to build on the progress we've made; got from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent coverage.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
52,CLINTON,And I don't want to rip away the security that people finally have; 18 million people now have healthcare; preexisting conditions are no longer a bar.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
53,CLINTON,So we have a difference.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
54,CLINTON,"I also believe in affordable college, but I don't believe in free college, because every expert that I have talked to says, look, how will you ever control the costs.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
55,CLINTON,"What I want to do is make sure middle class kids, not Donald Trump's kids, get to be able to afford college.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
56,CLINTON,I want to get the economy going again.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
57,CLINTON,"It's not just enough about what we're against, as important as that is.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
58,CLINTON,"I have a plan to create new jobs, manufacturing, infrastructure, clean energy jobs that will make us the 21st century clean energy super power.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
59,CLINTON,I also want to make sure small businesses can start and grow again.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
60,CLINTON,"And of course, I believe in raising the minimum wage and equal pay for work.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
61,CLINTON,"But the numbers just don't add up, from what Senator Sanders has been proposing.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
62,CLINTON,"That's why all of the independent experts, all of the editorial boards that have vetted both of us have concluded that it is just not achievable.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
63,CLINTON,Let's go down a path where we can actually tell people what we will do.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
64,CLINTON,A progressive is someone who makes progress.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
65,CLINTON,That's what I intend to do.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
66,TODD,"Thank you, Secretary.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
67,TODD,"Senator Sanders, so just explain how you spent nearly two decades in Congress and haven't gotten any of these things passed.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
68,TODD,"Why do you think as president you'll be able to achieve big, big new programs like this?",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
69,SANDERS,"Well, I haven't quite run for president before.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
70,SYSTEM,(LAUGHTER),0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
71,SYSTEM,(APPLAUSE),0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
72,SANDERS,Let's deal with some of the comments that Secretary Clinton made.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
73,SANDERS,"And by the way, you know, sometimes there's a lot of drama here.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
74,SANDERS,I have known Secretary Clinton for 25 years and respect her very much.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
75,SANDERS,Here is the issue.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
76,SANDERS,"Every major country on earth, whether it's the U.K., whether it's France, whether it's Canada, has managed to provide healthcare to all people as a right and they are spending significantly less per capita on health care than we are.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
77,SANDERS,So I do not accept the belief that the United States of America can't do that.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
78,SANDERS,I do not accept the belief that the United States of America and our government can't stand up to the ripoffs of the pharmaceutical industry which charge us by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
79,SANDERS,"Number two, in the economy today, everybody understands that we need a well educated workforce.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
80,SANDERS,This is 2016.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
81,SANDERS,"When we talk about public education, it can no longer be K through 12th grade.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
82,SANDERS,I do believe that public colleges and universities should be tuition free.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
83,SANDERS,"Well, how do we pay for that?",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
84,SANDERS,It's an expensive proposition.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
85,SANDERS,"I do believe that we should substantially lower student debt in this country, which is crushing millions of people.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
86,SANDERS,"We pay for it, in my view, by a tax on Wall Street speculation.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
87,SANDERS,The middle class bailed out Wall Street in their time of need.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
88,SANDERS,"Now, it is Wall Street's time to help the middle class.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
89,SYSTEM,(APPLAUSE),0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
90,CLINTON,If I could just follow up on that.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
91,SYSTEM,(APPLAUSE),0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
92,CLINTON,"There is no disagreement between us on universal coverage for health care, the disagreement is where do we start from and where do we end up.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
93,CLINTON,"The Republicans want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I want to improve it.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
94,CLINTON,"I want to build on it, get the costs down, get prescription drug costs down.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
95,CLINTON,Senator Sanders wants us to start all over again.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
96,CLINTON,"This was a major achievement of President Obama, of our country.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
97,CLINTON,It is helping people right now.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
98,CLINTON,I am not going to wait and have us plunge back into a contentious national debate that has very little chance of succeeding.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
99,CLINTON,Let's make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
100,SYSTEM,(APPLAUSE),0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
101,SANDERS,Let me...,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
102,TODD,Go.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
103,SANDERS,... this is a good discussion here.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
104,TODD,"Yes, go ahead.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
105,SANDERS,And let me just say this.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
106,SANDERS,"As Secretary Clinton may know, I am on the Health Education Labor Committee.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
107,SANDERS,That committee wrote the Affordable Care Act.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
108,SANDERS,The idea I would dismantle health care in America while we're waiting to pass a Medicare for all is just not accurate.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
109,SANDERS,"The Affordable Care Act has clearly, as Secretary Clinton made the point, done a lot of good things, but, what it has not done is dealt with the fact we have 29 million people today who have zero health insurance, we have even more who are underinsured with large deductibles and copayments and prescription drug prices are off the wall.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
110,SANDERS,"So I do believe that in the future, not by dismantling what we have here -- I helped write that bill -- but by moving forward, rallying the American people, I do believe we should have health care for all.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
111,SYSTEM,(APPLAUSE),0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
112,TODD,"All right, thank you both.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
113,TODD,Rachel.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
114,MADDOW,"Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders is campaigning against you now, at this point in the campaign, basically arguing that you are not progressive enough to be the Democratic nominee.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
115,MADDOW,"He has said that if you voted for the Iraq war, if you are in favor of the death penalty, if you wobbled on things like the Keystone Pipeline or TPP, if you said single payer health care could never happen, then you're too far to the right of the Democratic Party to be the party's standard bearer.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
116,MADDOW,"Given those policy positions, why should liberal Democrats support you and not Senator Sanders?",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
117,CLINTON,Well because I am a progressive who gets things done.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
118,CLINTON,"And the root of that word, progressive, is progress.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
119,CLINTON,"But I've heard Senator Sanders comments, and it's really caused me to wonder who's left in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
120,CLINTON,"Under his definition, President Obama is not progressive because he took donations from Wall Street; Vice President Biden is not progressive because she supported Keystone; Senator Shaheen is not progressive because she supports the trade pact.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
121,CLINTON,"Even the late, great Senator Paul Wellstone would not fit this definition because he voted for DOMA.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
122,CLINTON,"You know, we have differences and, honestly, I think we should be talk about what we want to do for the country.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
123,CLINTON,"But if we're going to get into labels, I don't think it was particularly progressive to vote against the Brady Bill five times.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
124,SYSTEM,(APPLAUSE),0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
125,CLINTON,I don't think it was progressive to vote to give gun makers and sellers immunity.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
126,CLINTON,I don't think it was progressive to vote against Ted Kennedy's immigration reform.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
127,CLINTON,"So we could go back and forth like this, but the fact is most people watching tonight want to know what we've done and what we will do.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
128,CLINTON,"That's why I am laying out a specific agenda that will make more progress, get more jobs with rising incomes, get us to universal health care coverage, get us to universal pre-k, paid family leave and the other elements of what I think will build a strong economy, that will ensure Americans keep making progress.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
129,CLINTON,That's what I'm offering and that's what I will do as president.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
130,SYSTEM,(APPLAUSE),0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
131,MADDOW,"Senator Sanders, have you established a list of what it means to be a progressive that is unrealistic?",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
132,SANDERS,"No, not at all.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
133,SANDERS,Here's the reality of American economic life today.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
134,SANDERS,The reality is that we have one of lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth because so many people have given up on the political process.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
135,SANDERS,The reality is that there has been trillions of dollars of wealth going from the middle class in the last 30 years to the top 1/10th of 1 percent.,1,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
136,SANDERS,The reality is we that have a corrupt campaign finance system which separates the American people's needs and desires from what Congress is doing.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
137,SANDERS,"So to my mind, what we have got to do is wage a political revolution where millions of people have given up on the political process, stand up and fight back, demand the government that represents us and not just a handful of campaign contribution -- contributors.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
138,SANDERS,"Now all of the ideas that I'm talking about, they are not radical ideas.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
139,SANDERS,"Making public colleges and universities tuition free, that exists in countries all over the world, used to exist in the United States.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
140,SANDERS,"Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and creating 13 million jobs by doing away with tax loopholes that large corporations now enjoy by putting their money into the Cayman Islands and other tax havens.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
141,SANDERS,That is not a radical idea.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
142,SANDERS,"What we need to do is to stand up to the big money interests, and the campaign contributors.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
143,SANDERS,"When we do that, we can, in fact, transform America.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
144,MADDOW,Thank you Senator.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
145,SYSTEM,(APPLAUSE),0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
146,TODD,"I'd like to follow up on a comment that Secretary Clinton said, Senator.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
147,TODD,President Obama has not called for abolishing the death penalty.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
148,TODD,"President Obama is for the big Asian trade deal known as TPP, and just yesterday you said you can't be both a moderate or a progressive, but you can't be both.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
149,TODD,"Is President Obama, in your judgment, based on these policies positions, a progressive?",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
150,SANDERS,Let me just pick up on this point.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
151,SANDERS,"This whole discussion began because I commented, not making overall evaluation about the Secretary.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
152,SANDERS,"She was in Ohio, I think, in September or November and she got up and said something like, I have been -- I'm paraphrasing, I have been criticized because people think I'm a moderate.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
153,SANDERS,"Well, I am a moderate.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
154,SANDERS,That's where this came from.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
155,SANDERS,It wasn't me paraphrasing her.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
156,SANDERS,"It is what she said, and all that I said was there's nothing wrong with being a moderate.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
157,SANDERS,"But, you can't be a moderate, you can't a progressive.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
158,SANDERS,"In terms of President Obama, I think if we remember where this country was seven years ago, 800,000 jobs being lost every month, $1.4 trillion dollar deficit.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
159,SANDERS,The world's financial system on the verge of collapse.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
160,SANDERS,"I think that President Obama, Vice President Biden, and the Democratic leadership in the House and the Senate have done a fantastic job.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
161,SANDERS,"We are in much better shape than we were seven years ago, although my Republican colleagues seem to have forgotten where we were seven years ago.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
162,SANDERS,"That's the fact, but, we still have a very long way to go.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
163,SANDERS,Do I think President Obama is a progressive?,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
164,SANDERS,"Yes, I do.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
165,SANDERS,I disagree with him on a number of issues including the trade agreement.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
166,SANDERS,"But, yes, I think he has done an excellent job.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
167,CLINTON,"Well, Chuck...",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
168,TODD,"... (inaudible) Clinton, go ahead...",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
169,CLINTON,"If I could, you know, in the very first debate I was asked am I a moderate or a progressive and I said I'm a progressive who likes to get things done.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
170,CLINTON,"Cherry picking a quote here or there doesn't change my record of having fought for racial justice, having fought for kids rights, having fought the kind of inequities that fueled my interest in service in the first place going back to my days in the Children's Defense Fund.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
171,CLINTON,It certainly didn't stop me from taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
172,CLINTON,"Before it was called Hillarycare -- I mean, before it was called ObamaCare it was called Hillarycare because we took them on, and we weren't successful, but we kept fighting and we got the children's health insurance program.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
173,CLINTON,"Every step along the way I have stood up, and fought, and have the scars to prove it.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
174,CLINTON,"So, again...",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
175,SYSTEM,(APPLAUSE),0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
176,CLINTON,"I think it's important that, look, I understand Senator Sanders really trying to distinguish himself.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv

376,MADDOW,"... on the issue of Wall Street, when our reporters go out and talk to people on the ground in the early states, what they tell us over and over again when they find voters who are leaning toward Senator Sanders rather than yourself is that the most frequent area of concern that they hear from those voters is the issue of Wall Street and whether or not you are too close to Wall Street.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv

400,SANDERS,Wall Street is perhaps the most powerful economic and political force in this country.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
401,SANDERS,"You have companies like Goldman Sachs, who just recently paid a settlement fine with the federal government for $5 billion for defrauding investors.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
402,SANDERS,Goldman Sachs was one of those companies whose illegal activity helped destroy our economy and ruin the lives of millions of Americans.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
403,SANDERS,But this is what a rigged economy and a corrupt campaign finance system and a broken criminal justice is about.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
404,SANDERS,"These guys are so powerful that not one of the executives on Wall Street has been charged with anything after paying, in this case of Goldman Sachs, a $5 billion fine.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv

414,CLINTON,And that's why I have put forward a plan to do just that.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
415,CLINTON,"And it's been judged to be the toughest, most effective and comprehensive one.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
416,CLINTON,I have great respect for Senator Sanders's commitment to try to restore Glass-Steagall.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv

419,CLINTON,"You know, we now have power under the Dodd-Frank legislation to break up banks.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
420,CLINTON,And I've said I will use that power if they pose a systemic risk.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
421,CLINTON,"But I want to go further, because it was investment banks, it was insurance companies, it was mortgage companies, all of which contributed.",0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
422,CLINTON,So let's not just be narrowly focused on one part of the problem.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv
423,CLINTON,We have a lot of issues with corporate power that have to be addressed.,0,20160209_msnbc_dem.tsv

491,CLINTON,And what we have here is a big difference.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
492,CLINTON,Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill five times.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
493,CLINTON,"He voted for the most important NRA priority, namely giving immunity from liability to gun-makers and dealers, something that is at the root of a lot of the problems that we are facing.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
494,CLINTON,"Then he doubled down on that in the New York Daily News interview, when asked whether he would support the Sandy Hook parents suing to try to do something to rein in the advertising of the AR-15, which is advertised to young people as being a combat weapon, killing on the battlefield.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
495,CLINTON,He said they didn't deserve their day in court.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
496,CLINTON,I could not disagree more.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
497,CLINTON,"And, finally, this is the only industry in America, the only one.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
498,SYSTEM,(APPLAUSE),0,20160414_9dem.tsv
499,CLINTON,That has this kind of special protection.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv

502,BLITZER,... Thank you...,0,20160414_9dem.tsv

505,BLITZER,Senator?,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
506,BLITZER,"Well, the only problem is, Wolf, she didn't answer your question.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
507,BLITZER,You asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
508,BLITZER,You asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible for a lot of the gun violence.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
509,BLITZER,You made the point what she said was totally absurd.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
510,BLITZER,"I asked her, are you seriously blaming Vermont and implicitly Senator Sanders for New York's gun violence.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
511,BLITZER,She said no.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
512,BLITZER,"But, go ahead.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
513,SANDERS,Then why did she put out that statement?,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
514,CLINTON,I put it out...,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
515,SANDERS,"... Excuse me, I think I'm responding now.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
516,BLITZER,"Please, go ahead sir.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
517,SANDERS,"A statement that was refuted by the governor of the state of Vermont, who was a supporter of hers, who said, yeah, in campaigns people tend to exaggerate.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
518,SANDERS,Here is the fact on guns.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
519,SANDERS,Let's talk about guns.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
520,SANDERS,"That horrible, horrible Sandy Hook -- what's the word we want to use, murder, assault, slaughter, unspeakable act.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
521,SANDERS,"Back in 1988, I ran for the United States Congress one seat in the state of Vermont.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
522,SANDERS,"I probably lost that election, which I lost by three points, because I was the only candidate running who said, you know what?",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
523,SANDERS,"We should ban assault weapons, not seen them sold or distributed in the United States of America.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv

525,SYSTEM,(APPLAUSE),0,20160414_9dem.tsv

527,SYSTEM,(APPLAUSE),0,20160414_9dem.tsv
528,BLITZER,"Thank you, Senator.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv

530,SYSTEM,(CHEERING),0,20160414_9dem.tsv
531,BLITZER,"Secretary Clinton, I want you to respond to that, but why did you put out that statement blaming Vermont and its gun policy for some of the death of -- by guns in New York?",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
532,CLINTON,"Well, the facts are that most of the guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from out of state.",1,20160414_9dem.tsv
533,CLINTON,They come from the states that don't have kind of serious efforts to control guns that we do in New York.,1,20160414_9dem.tsv
534,CLINTON,"But let me say this -- in 1988, as we've heard on every debate occasion, Senator Sanders did run for the Congress and he lost.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
535,CLINTON,"He came back in 1990 and he won, and during that campaign he made a commitment to the NRA that he would be against waiting periods.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
536,CLINTON,"And, in fact, in his own book, he talks about his 1990 campaign, and here's what he said.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
537,CLINTON,"He clearly was helped by the NRA, because they ran ads against his opponent.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
538,CLINTON,"So, then he went to the Congress, where he has been a largely very reliable supporter of the NRA.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
539,CLINTON,"Voting -- he kept his word to the NRA, he voted against the Brady Bill five times because it had waiting periods in it.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
540,CLINTON,"Thankfully, enough people finally voted for it to keep guns out of the hands of who should not have them.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
541,SYSTEM,(APPLAUSE),0,20160414_9dem.tsv
542,BLITZER,"Senator, I want you to respond, but I also want you to respond to this.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
543,BLITZER,You recently said you do not think crime victims should be able to sue gun makers for damages.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
544,BLITZER,"The daughter of the Sandy Hook Elementary School who was killed back in the 2012 mass shooting, says you owe her and families an apology.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
545,BLITZER,Do you?,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
546,SANDERS,What we need to do is to do everything that we can to make certain that guns do not fall into the hands of people who do not have them.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
547,SANDERS,"Now, I voted against this gun liability law because I was concerned that in rural areas all over this country, if a gun shop owner sells a weapon legally to somebody, and that person then goes out and kills somebody, I don't believe it is appropriate that that gun shop owner who just sold a legal weapon to be held accountable and be sued.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
548,SANDERS,"But, what I do believe is when gun shop owners and others knowingly are selling weapons to people who should not have them -- somebody walks in.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
549,SANDERS,"They want thousands of rounds of ammunition, or they want a whole lot of guns, yes, that gun shop owner or that gun manufacturer should be held liable.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv

551,SANDERS,"No, I don't think I owe them an apology.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
552,SANDERS,"They are in court today, and actually they won a preliminary decision today.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
553,SANDERS,"They have the right to sue, and I support them and anyone else who wants the right to sue.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
554,CLINTON,"Well, I believe that the law that Senator Sanders voted for that I voted against, giving this special protection to gun manufacturers and to dealers, is an absolute abdication of responsibility on the part of those who voted for it.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
555,CLINTON,"This is a -- this is a unique gift given to only one industry in the world by the United States Congress, as Senator Murphy from Connecticut said, we have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
556,CLINTON,And the point that Senator Sanders keeps making about how he wouldn't want a mom and pop store -- that was not the point of this.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
557,CLINTON,"And if he can point to any, any incident where that happened, I would love to hear about it.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
558,CLINTON,"What was really going on, I'll tell you, because it has a lot to do with New York City.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
559,CLINTON,New York City was on the brink of being able to hold manufacturers and dealers accountable through a very carefully crafted legal strategy.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
560,BLITZER,Thank you.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
561,CLINTON,"The NRA came to their supporters in the Congress and said, stop it, stop it now, and Senator Sanders joined those who did.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
562,BLITZER,"Thank you, Secretary.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
563,BLITZER,"Senator, go ahead.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
564,SANDERS,"Let me just reiterate -- just reiterate so there is no confusion, decades ago, before it was popular, in a rural state with no gun control, Bernie Sanders said, let's ban assault weapons, not see them distributed in the United States of America.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
565,BLITZER,"Thank you, Senator.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
566,BLITZER,"Let's turn it over to Errol Lewis, of New York 1 Time Warner Cable News.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
567,LOUIS,"Secretary Clinton, the 1994 crime bill that you supported added 100,000 police officers across the country and banned certain assault weapons.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
568,LOUIS,It also imposed tougher prison sentences and eliminated federal funding for inmate education.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
569,LOUIS,"Looking at the bill as a whole, do you believe it was a net positive or do you think it was a mistake?",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
570,CLINTON,"Well, I think that it had some positive aspects to it.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
571,CLINTON,And you mentioned some of them.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
572,CLINTON,"The Violence Against Women Act, which has been a very important piece of legislation, in my opinion.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
573,SYSTEM,(APPLAUSE),0,20160414_9dem.tsv
574,CLINTON,And it also did some things which were to provide more opportunities for young people.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
575,CLINTON,"So if we were to have the balance sheet on one side, there are some positive actions and changes.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
576,CLINTON,"On the other side, there were decisions that were made that now we must revisit and we have to correct.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
577,CLINTON,I think that sentences got much too long.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
578,CLINTON,"The original idea was not that we would increase sentences for non-violent low-level offenders, but once the federal government did what it did, states piled on.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
579,CLINTON,So we have a problem.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
580,CLINTON,And the very first speech I gave in this campaign was about what I will do to reform the criminal justice system and end the over-mass incarceration.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
581,CLINTON,"So I think that if all of us go and look back at where we were, Senator Sanders voted for the crime bill, and he says the same thing, there were some good things, and things that we have to change and learn from.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
582,CLINTON,So that's how I see it.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
583,CLINTON,And I think we ought to be putting our attention on forging a consensus to make the changes that will divert more people from the criminal justice system to start.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv

603,LOUIS,Why did you call him out?,0,20160414_9dem.tsv

666,CLINTON,"But there has never been any doubt that when I was a senator, I tried -- I joined with others to try to get rid of the subsidies for big oil.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
667,CLINTON,"And I have proposed that again, because that's what I think needs to be done as we transition from fossil fuels to clean energy.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv

670,CLINTON,Best we can tell from the reports that are done.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv

886,CLINTON,"That's exactly right, including you.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
887,CLINTON,And what we did was to try to provide support for our European and Arab allies and partners.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
888,CLINTON,The decision was the president's.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
889,CLINTON,Did I do the due diligence?,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
890,CLINTON,Did I talk to everybody I could talk to?,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
891,CLINTON,Did I visit every capital and then report back to the president?,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
892,CLINTON,"Yes, I did.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
893,CLINTON,That's what a secretary of state does.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
894,CLINTON,"But at the end of the day, those are the decisions that are made by the president to in any way use American military power.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
895,CLINTON,And the president made that decision.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
896,CLINTON,"And, yes, we did try without success because of the Libyans' obstruction to our efforts, but we did try and we will continue to try to help the Libyan people.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
897,BLITZER,"Thank you, Secretary.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
898,BLITZER,"Go ahead, Senator.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
899,SANDERS,"If you listen, you know -- two points.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
900,SANDERS,"Number one, yes, 100-0 in the Senate voted for democracy in Libya and I would vote for that again.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
901,SANDERS,But that is very different from getting actively involved to overthrow and bring about regime change without fully understanding what the consequence of that regime change would be.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
902,SANDERS,"Second of all, I know you keep referring to Barack Obama all night here, but you in Syria, you in Syria talked about a no-fly zone, which the president certainly does not support, nor do I support because, A, it will cost an enormous sum of money, second of all, it runs the risk of getting us sucked into perpetual warfare in that region.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
903,SANDERS,"Thirdly, when we talk about Syria right now, no debate, like Gadhafi, like Saddam Hussein, Assad is another brutal murdering dictator, but right now our fight is to destroy ISIS first, and to get rid of Assad second.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
904,CLINTON,"Well, I think Senator Sanders has just reinforced my point.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
905,CLINTON,"Yes, when I was secretary of state I did urge, along with the Department of Defense and the CIA that we seek out, vet, and train, and arm Syrian opposition figures so that they could defend themselves against Assad.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
906,CLINTON,The president said no.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
907,CLINTON,"Now, that's how it works.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
908,CLINTON,People who work for the president make recommendations and then the president makes the decision.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
909,CLINTON,So I think it's only fair to look at where we are in Syria today.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
910,CLINTON,"And, yes, I do still support a no-fly zone because I think we need to put in safe havens for those poor Syrians who are fleeing both Assad and ISIS and have some place that they can be safe.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
911,BLITZER,"Staying on national security, Dana Bash has a question.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
912,BASH,"Senator Sanders, in 1997, you said this about NATO, you said, quote: ""It is not the time to continue wasting tens of billions of dollars helping to defend Europe, let alone assuming more than our share of any cost associated with expanding NATO.""",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
913,BASH,Do you still feel that way?,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
914,SANDERS,"Well, what I believe, if my memory is correct here, we spend about 75 percent of the entire cost of the military aspect of NATO.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
915,SANDERS,"Given the fact that France has a very good health care system and free public education, college education for their people, the U.K. has a good National Health Service and they also provide fairly reasonable higher education, you know what, yeah, I do believe that the countries of Europe should pick up more of the burden for their defense.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
916,SANDERS,"Yes, I do.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
917,SYSTEM,(APPLAUSE),0,20160414_9dem.tsv
918,BASH,"And just following up, Senator Sanders, Donald Trump also argues that NATO is unfair economically to the U.S. because America pays a disproportionate share.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
919,BASH,So how is what you say about NATO and your proposal different than his?,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
920,SANDERS,"Well, you got to ask -- you got to ask Trump.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
921,SANDERS,"All I can tell you is, with a huge deficit, with 47 million people living in poverty, with our inner cities collapsing, yeah, I do think countries like Germany and U.K. and France and European countries whose economy, or at least its standard of living and health care and education, they're doing pretty well.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
922,SANDERS,"So I would not be embarrassed as president of the United States to stay to our European allies, you know what, the United States of America cannot just support your economies.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
923,SANDERS,You got to put up your own fair share of the defense burden.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv

927,CLINTON,I support our continuing involvement in NATO.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
928,CLINTON,And it is important to ask for our NATO allies to pay more of the cost.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
929,CLINTON,"There is a requirement that they should be doing so, and I believe that needs to be enforced.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
930,CLINTON,But there's a larger question here.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
931,CLINTON,NATO has been the most successful military alliance in probably human history.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
932,CLINTON,"It has bound together across the Atlantic countries that are democracies, that have many of the same values and interests, and now we need to modernize it and move it into the 21st century to serve as that head of our defense operations in Europe when it comes to terrorism and other threats that we face.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
933,CLINTON,So...,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
934,BASH,"But, Madam Secretary... CLINTON: ... yes, of course they should be paying more, but that doesn't mean if they don't we leave, because I don't think that's in America's interests.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
935,BASH,"That's going to be part of my -- my question to you is, to that point, there are 28 countries in the alliance, and the United States gives more money to NATO's budget than 21 of those countries combined.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
936,BASH,"If they don't agree to pay more, as you suggested, then what would you do as commander-in-chief?",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
937,CLINTON,I will stay in NATO.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
938,CLINTON,"I will stay in NATO, and we will continue to look for missions and other kinds of programs that they will support.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
939,CLINTON,"Remember, NATO was with us in Afghanistan.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
940,CLINTON,Most of the member countries also lost soldiers and civilians in Afghanistan.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
941,CLINTON,They came to our rallying defense after 9/11.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
942,CLINTON,That meant a lot.,0,20160414_9dem.tsv
943,CLINTON,"And, yes, we have to work out the financial aspects of it, but let's not forget what's really happening.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv
944,CLINTON,"With Russia being more aggressive, making all kinds of intimidating moves toward the Baltic countries, we've seen what they've done in Eastern Ukraine, we know how they want to rewrite the map of Europe, it is not in our interests.",0,20160414_9dem.tsv

19,HOLT,"Well, I don't expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
20,HOLT,"We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we're going to press for specifics.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
21,HOLT,"I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
22,HOLT,"Candidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
23,HOLT,"So, let's begin.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
24,HOLT,"We're calling this opening segment ""Achieving Prosperity.""",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
25,HOLT,And central to that is jobs.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
26,HOLT,There are two economic realities in America today.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
27,HOLT,"There's been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
28,HOLT,"However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
29,HOLT,"Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
30,CLINTON,"Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
31,CLINTON,The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
32,CLINTON,"Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
33,CLINTON,"First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
34,CLINTON,"That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
35,CLINTON,I want us to invest in you.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
36,CLINTON,I want us to invest in your future.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
37,CLINTON,"That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
38,CLINTON,We also have to make the economy fairer.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
39,CLINTON,"That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
40,CLINTON,I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
41,CLINTON,"If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
42,CLINTON,And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
43,CLINTON,I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
44,CLINTON,"So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
45,CLINTON,Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
46,CLINTON,How are we going to do it?,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
47,CLINTON,We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
48,CLINTON,"Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
49,CLINTON,We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
50,CLINTON,"You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
51,CLINTON,I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
52,HOLT,"Secretary Clinton, thank you.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
53,HOLT,"Mr. Trump, the same question to you.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
54,HOLT,It's about putting money -- more money into the pockets of American workers.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
55,HOLT,You have up to two minutes.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
56,TRUMP,"Thank you, Lester.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
57,TRUMP,Our jobs are fleeing the country.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
58,TRUMP,They're going to Mexico.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
59,TRUMP,They're going to many other countries.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
60,TRUMP,You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
61,TRUMP,"They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
62,TRUMP,And we have a very good fight.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
63,TRUMP,And we have a winning fight.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
64,TRUMP,"Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
65,TRUMP,"So we're losing our good jobs, so many of them.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
66,TRUMP,"When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
67,TRUMP,"They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
68,TRUMP,"With the United States, as he said, not so much.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
69,TRUMP,So Ford is leaving.,1,20160926_1pres.tsv
70,TRUMP,"You see that, their small car division leaving.",1,20160926_1pres.tsv
71,TRUMP,"Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio.",1,20160926_1pres.tsv
72,TRUMP,They're all leaving.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
73,TRUMP,And we can't allow it to happen anymore.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
74,TRUMP,"As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
75,TRUMP,"We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
76,TRUMP,But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
77,TRUMP,"We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
78,TRUMP,All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
79,TRUMP,"They left -- fired 1,400 people.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
80,TRUMP,They're going to Mexico.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
81,TRUMP,So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
82,TRUMP,We cannot let it happen.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
83,TRUMP,"Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
84,TRUMP,That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
85,TRUMP,It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
86,TRUMP,Companies will come.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
87,TRUMP,They will build.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
88,TRUMP,They will expand.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
89,TRUMP,New companies will start.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
90,TRUMP,"And I look very, very much forward to doing it.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
91,TRUMP,"We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
92,HOLT,"Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
93,CLINTON,"Well, I think that trade is an important issue.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
94,CLINTON,"Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
95,CLINTON,"And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
96,CLINTON,"We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
97,CLINTON,And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
98,CLINTON,"In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
99,CLINTON,"I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
100,CLINTON,That is not how we grow the economy.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
101,CLINTON,"We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
102,CLINTON,I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
103,CLINTON,I understand that.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
104,CLINTON,"You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
105,CLINTON,"He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.",1,20160926_1pres.tsv
106,CLINTON,I don't buy that.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
107,CLINTON,I have a different experience.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
108,CLINTON,My father was a small-businessman.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
109,CLINTON,He worked really hard.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
110,CLINTON,"He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
111,CLINTON,"And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
112,CLINTON,That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
113,HOLT,"Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
114,HOLT,"You've talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
115,HOLT,How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas?,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
116,HOLT,"How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
117,TRUMP,"Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.",1,20160926_1pres.tsv
118,TRUMP,Our country's in deep trouble.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
119,TRUMP,"We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
120,TRUMP,"They're the best, the best ever at it.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
121,TRUMP,"What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
122,TRUMP,So we have to do that.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
123,TRUMP,We have to renegotiate our trade deals.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
124,TRUMP,"And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
125,TRUMP,Let me give you the example of Mexico.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
126,TRUMP,They have a VAT tax.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
127,TRUMP,We're on a different system.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
128,TRUMP,"When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
129,TRUMP,"When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
130,TRUMP,"When they sell into us, there's no tax.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
131,TRUMP,It's a defective agreement.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
132,TRUMP,"It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
133,TRUMP,"Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK?",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
134,TRUMP,Good.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
135,TRUMP,I want you to be very happy.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
136,TRUMP,It's very important to me.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
137,TRUMP,"But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
138,TRUMP,She's been doing this for 30 years.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
139,TRUMP,And why hasn't she made the agreements better?,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
140,TRUMP,The NAFTA agreement is defective.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
141,TRUMP,"Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
142,HOLT,"Let me interrupt just a moment, but...",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
143,TRUMP,"Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
144,TRUMP,They should have been doing this for years.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
145,TRUMP,"What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
146,TRUMP,"We cannot do it any longer, Lester.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
147,HOLT,"Back to the question, though.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
148,HOLT,"How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers?",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
149,HOLT,How do you make them bring the jobs back?,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
150,TRUMP,"Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
151,TRUMP,The companies are leaving.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
152,TRUMP,"I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
153,TRUMP,"They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
154,TRUMP,"And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
155,TRUMP,We wish you a lot of luck.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
156,TRUMP,"But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
157,TRUMP,"And once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
158,TRUMP,"So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
159,TRUMP,We have to stop them from leaving.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
160,TRUMP,"And that's a big, big factor.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
161,HOLT,Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
162,CLINTON,"Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
163,CLINTON,"We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
164,CLINTON,"That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
165,CLINTON,"In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
166,CLINTON,"He said, back in 2006, ""Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.""",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
167,CLINTON,"Well, it did collapse.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
168,TRUMP,"That's called business, by the way.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
169,CLINTON,Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
170,CLINTON,Five million people lost their homes.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
171,CLINTON,And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
172,CLINTON,"Now, we have come back from that abyss.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
173,CLINTON,And it has not been easy.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
174,CLINTON,"So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
175,CLINTON,"Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.",1,20160926_1pres.tsv
176,CLINTON,"They've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy.",1,20160926_1pres.tsv
177,CLINTON,Take clean energy.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
178,CLINTON,Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
179,CLINTON,Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.,1,20160926_1pres.tsv
180,CLINTON,I think it's real.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv

184,CLINTON,I think science is real.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
185,TRUMP,I do not say that.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
186,CLINTON,"And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
187,CLINTON,And here's what we can do.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
188,CLINTON,We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
189,CLINTON,We can have enough clean energy to power every home.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
190,CLINTON,We can build a new modern electric grid.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
191,CLINTON,That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
192,CLINTON,"So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
193,HOLT,Mr. Trump?,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
194,TRUMP,She talks about solar panels.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
195,TRUMP,"We invested in a solar company, our country.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
196,TRUMP,That was a disaster.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
197,TRUMP,They lost plenty of money on that one.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
198,TRUMP,"Now, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
199,TRUMP,Our energy policies are a disaster.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
200,TRUMP,"Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
201,TRUMP,You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
202,TRUMP,"The Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
203,TRUMP,"He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
204,TRUMP,So I will tell you this.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
205,TRUMP,We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
206,TRUMP,"And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
207,TRUMP,"And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
208,TRUMP,"And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
209,TRUMP,You've been doing this for 30 years.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv

486,CLINTON,"You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
487,CLINTON,We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
488,CLINTON,"So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
489,CLINTON,And I think there may be a couple of reasons.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
490,CLINTON,"First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
491,CLINTON,"Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv

493,CLINTON,"Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.",1,20160926_1pres.tsv
494,TRUMP,That makes me smart.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
495,CLINTON,"So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
496,CLINTON,"And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv

498,CLINTON,They don't give you all the details that tax returns would.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
499,CLINTON,And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
500,CLINTON,"And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
501,CLINTON,And we'll guess.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
502,CLINTON,We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
503,CLINTON,"But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts?",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
504,CLINTON,Who does he owe money to?,0,20160926_1pres.tsv

524,TRUMP,You learn a lot from financial disclosure.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv

539,TRUMP,And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
540,TRUMP,It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv

620,CLINTON,We have to restore trust between communities and the police.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
621,CLINTON,"We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
622,CLINTON,"Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
623,CLINTON,"Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
624,CLINTON,"So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
625,CLINTON,I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
626,CLINTON,"But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
627,CLINTON,So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
628,CLINTON,And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
629,CLINTON,"The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
630,CLINTON,"So we have to do two things, as I said.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
631,CLINTON,We have to restore trust.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
632,CLINTON,We have to work with the police.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
633,CLINTON,We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
634,CLINTON,"And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
635,HOLT,"All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
636,HOLT,How do you heal the divide?,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
637,TRUMP,"Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
638,TRUMP,And we need law and order.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
639,TRUMP,"If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
640,TRUMP,"And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
641,TRUMP,"I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just -- just came in.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
642,TRUMP,"We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv

648,TRUMP,Is this a war-torn country?,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
649,TRUMP,What are we doing?,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
650,TRUMP,And we have to stop the violence.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
651,TRUMP,We have to bring back law and order.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
652,TRUMP,"In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed.",1,20160926_1pres.tsv
653,TRUMP,We have to bring back law and order.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
654,TRUMP,"Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
655,TRUMP,It brought the crime rate way down.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
656,TRUMP,But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
657,TRUMP,We have gangs roaming the street.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
658,TRUMP,"And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
659,TRUMP,And they have guns.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
660,TRUMP,And they shoot people.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
661,TRUMP,And we have to be very strong.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
662,TRUMP,And we have to be very vigilant.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
663,TRUMP,We have to be -- we have to know what we're doing.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
664,TRUMP,"Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
665,TRUMP,"We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
666,HOLT,"Your two -- your two minutes expired, but I do want to follow up.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
667,HOLT,"Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men.",1,20160926_1pres.tsv
668,TRUMP,"No, you're wrong.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
669,TRUMP,"It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
670,TRUMP,It was taken away from her.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
671,TRUMP,"And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
672,TRUMP,They would have won an appeal.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
673,TRUMP,"If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
674,HOLT,The argument is that it's a form of racial profiling.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
675,TRUMP,"No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
676,TRUMP,These are felons.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
677,TRUMP,"These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
678,TRUMP,You need more police.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
679,TRUMP,"You need a better community, you know, relation.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
680,TRUMP,You don't have good community relations in Chicago.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
681,TRUMP,It's terrible.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
682,TRUMP,I have property there.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
683,TRUMP,It's terrible what's going on in Chicago.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
684,TRUMP,"But when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
685,TRUMP,You need better relationships.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
686,TRUMP,I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
687,TRUMP,"You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
688,TRUMP,"But you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
689,TRUMP,So there's some bad things going on.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
690,TRUMP,Some really bad things.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
691,HOLT,Secretary Clinton...,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
692,TRUMP,"But we need -- Lester, we need law and order.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
693,TRUMP,"And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
694,TRUMP,And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
695,HOLT,Secretary Clinton?,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
696,CLINTON,"Well, I've heard -- I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
697,TRUMP,Ugh.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
698,CLINTON,"You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
699,CLINTON,There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
700,CLINTON,But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
701,CLINTON,"There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
702,CLINTON,"Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective.",1,20160926_1pres.tsv
703,CLINTON,It did not do what it needed to do.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
704,CLINTON,"Now, I believe in community policing.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
705,CLINTON,"And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
706,CLINTON,Property crime is down 40 percent.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
707,CLINTON,We just don't want to see it creep back up.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
708,CLINTON,We've had 25 years of very good cooperation.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
709,CLINTON,"But there were some problems, some unintended consequences.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
710,CLINTON,Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
711,CLINTON,"And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
712,CLINTON,So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
713,CLINTON,We cannot just say law and order.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
714,CLINTON,"We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
715,CLINTON,We need to have more second chance programs.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
716,CLINTON,I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
717,CLINTON,You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
718,CLINTON,So there are some positive ways we can work on this.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
719,CLINTON,And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
720,CLINTON,"Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
721,CLINTON,"In a lot of places, our police are outgunned.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
722,CLINTON,"We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
723,CLINTON,And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
724,CLINTON,"If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
725,CLINTON,"So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
726,HOLT,"Secretary Clinton, last week, you said we've got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
727,HOLT,Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
728,CLINTON,"Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
729,CLINTON,"I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
730,CLINTON,"And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
731,CLINTON,"But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
732,CLINTON,"I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
733,CLINTON,They admit it's an issue.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
734,CLINTON,They've got a lot of concerns.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
735,CLINTON,"Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
736,CLINTON,"They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
737,CLINTON,And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
738,HOLT,Mr. Trump...,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
739,TRUMP,I'd like to respond to that.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
740,HOLT,Please.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
741,TRUMP,"First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
742,TRUMP,I agree with you.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
743,TRUMP,"When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
744,TRUMP,"These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
745,TRUMP,But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
746,TRUMP,"And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
747,TRUMP,But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
748,TRUMP,I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
749,TRUMP,"And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
750,TRUMP,I think you've apologized for it.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
751,TRUMP,But I think it was a terrible thing to say.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
752,TRUMP,"And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
753,TRUMP,"Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
754,TRUMP,"And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
755,TRUMP,"I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
756,TRUMP,Five hundred murders is a lot of murders.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
757,TRUMP,"It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
758,TRUMP,"But we went from 2,200 to 500.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
759,TRUMP,And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
760,TRUMP,And it was terminated by current mayor.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
761,TRUMP,But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
762,TRUMP,Tremendous beyond belief.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
763,TRUMP,"So when you say it has no impact, it really did.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
764,TRUMP,"It had a very, very big impact.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
765,CLINTON,"Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders.",1,20160926_1pres.tsv

776,CLINTON,"Look, one murder is too many.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
777,CLINTON,But it is important that we learn about what has been effective.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv

825,HOLT,That was...,0,20160926_1pres.tsv

831,HOLT,The birth certificate was produced in 2011.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv

837,TRUMP,"I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
838,TRUMP,But nobody was caring much about it.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
839,TRUMP,But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
840,TRUMP,And I think I did a good job.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
841,TRUMP,Secretary Clinton also fought it.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv

855,TRUMP,I say nothing.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
856,TRUMP,But let me just tell you.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
857,TRUMP,"When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv

865,CLINTON,But it can't be dismissed that easily.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
866,CLINTON,He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
867,CLINTON,"There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
868,CLINTON,"But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
869,CLINTON,He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv
870,CLINTON,So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv

872,CLINTON,"You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity.",0,20160926_1pres.tsv
873,CLINTON,And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv

879,TRUMP,You treated him with terrible disrespect.,0,20160926_1pres.tsv

13,CLINTON,Are you a teacher?,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
14,CLINTON,"Yes, I think that that's a very good question, because I've heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
15,CLINTON,And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we're good.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
16,CLINTON,"And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv

18,CLINTON,I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
19,CLINTON,"That's why the slogan of my campaign is ""Stronger Together,"" because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals -- and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv

33,TRUMP,"I cannot believe I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
34,TRUMP,And my whole concept was to make America great again.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
35,TRUMP,"When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.",1,20161010_2pres.tsv
36,TRUMP,"When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it's in business and trade, where we're doing so badly.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
37,TRUMP,"Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit.",1,20161010_2pres.tsv

40,TRUMP,It's hard to believe.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
41,TRUMP,Inconceivable.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv

49,TRUMP,"At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
50,TRUMP,We need justice.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
51,TRUMP,"But I want to do things that haven't been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
52,TRUMP,It's called make America great again.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
53,COOPER,"Thank you, Mr. Trump.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
54,COOPER,The question from Patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for today's youth?,0,20161010_2pres.tsv

57,COOPER,"You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
58,COOPER,That is sexual assault.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv

61,TRUMP,"No, I didn't say that at all.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
62,TRUMP,I don't think you understood what was -- this was locker room talk.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv

66,TRUMP,Certainly I'm not proud of it.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
67,TRUMP,But this is locker room talk.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
68,TRUMP,"You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have -- and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
69,TRUMP,"We haven't seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv

74,TRUMP,I hate it.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv

76,TRUMP,I will knock the hell out of ISIS.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
77,TRUMP,We're going to defeat ISIS.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv

80,COOPER,"So, Mr. Trump...",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
81,TRUMP,And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
82,COOPER,"Just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?",0,20161010_2pres.tsv

102,COOPER,"Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
103,CLINTON,"Well, like everyone else, I've spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
104,CLINTON,"You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
105,CLINTON,Donald Trump is different.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
106,CLINTON,I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
107,CLINTON,And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
108,CLINTON,"What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
109,CLINTON,And he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
110,CLINTON,But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
111,CLINTON,Because we've seen this throughout the campaign.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
112,CLINTON,We have seen him insult women.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
113,CLINTON,"We've seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
114,CLINTON,We've seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
115,CLINTON,"We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
116,CLINTON,"So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
117,CLINTON,"But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
118,CLINTON,So this is who Donald Trump is.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
119,CLINTON,"And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
120,CLINTON,"That's why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
121,CLINTON,"These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv

333,CLINTON,"But here's what I don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million got insurance who didn't have it before.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv

341,CLINTON,So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
342,CLINTON,But we've got to get costs down.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
343,CLINTON,We've got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv

365,TRUMP,It's going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv

456,CLINTON,"Well, thank you for asking your question.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv

458,CLINTON,"And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
459,CLINTON,I want to say just a couple of things.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
460,CLINTON,"First, we've had Muslims in America since George Washington.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
461,CLINTON,And we've had many successful Muslims.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
462,CLINTON,We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
463,CLINTON,"My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you're willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
464,CLINTON,That's what America is.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
465,CLINTON,That's what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
466,CLINTON,It's also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
467,CLINTON,We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
468,CLINTON,I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
469,CLINTON,"I've met with a lot of them, and I've heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that's what I want to see.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
470,CLINTON,"It's also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
471,CLINTON,"Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans?",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
472,CLINTON,"And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
473,CLINTON,We are not at war with Islam.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
474,CLINTON,And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
475,CLINTON,So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv

482,RADDATZ,Is that correct?,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
483,RADDATZ,"And if it is, was it a mistake to have a religious test?",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
484,TRUMP,"First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
485,TRUMP,Iraq was disaster.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
486,TRUMP,So he would have been alive today.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
487,TRUMP,The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
488,TRUMP,Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands -- excuse me.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
489,TRUMP,Excuse me..,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
490,RADDATZ,And why did it morph into that?,0,20161010_2pres.tsv

492,RADDATZ,Do you still believe...,0,20161010_2pres.tsv

496,TRUMP,Why don't you interrupt her?,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
497,RADDATZ,Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
498,TRUMP,It's called extreme vetting.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
499,TRUMP,We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
500,TRUMP,And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
501,TRUMP,"People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
502,TRUMP,This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
503,TRUMP,We have enough problems in this country.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
504,TRUMP,I believe in building safe zones.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
505,TRUMP,"I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
506,TRUMP,"But I don't want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
507,TRUMP,We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
508,RADDATZ,"And, Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 Syrian refugees.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
509,RADDATZ,We know you want tougher vetting.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
510,RADDATZ,That's not a perfect system.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
511,RADDATZ,So why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country?,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
512,CLINTON,"Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
513,CLINTON,"But there are a lot of refugees, women and children -- think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he'd been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
514,CLINTON,"There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
515,CLINTON,And we need to do our part.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
516,CLINTON,We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
517,CLINTON,"But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
518,CLINTON,"But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
519,CLINTON,How do you do that?,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
520,CLINTON,We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
521,CLINTON,How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county?,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
522,CLINTON,Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country?,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
523,CLINTON,And how do we expect to be able to implement those?,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
524,CLINTON,So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
525,CLINTON,"And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv

685,CLINTON,"His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they've ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv

771,CLINTON,I'm very glad to do so.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
772,CLINTON,"Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children's Health Insurance Program.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv

777,CLINTON,Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
778,CLINTON,I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
779,CLINTON,"And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv

788,RADDATZ,This is about the audience.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
789,TRUMP,Excuse me.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
790,TRUMP,Because she has been a disaster as a senator.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
791,TRUMP,A disaster.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
792,RADDATZ,"Mr. Trump, we're going to move on.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
793,RADDATZ,"The heart-breaking video of a 5-year-old Syrian boy named Omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in Aleppo focused the world's attention on the horrors of the war in Syria, with 136 million views on Facebook alone.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv

795,RADDATZ,"Just days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its ally, Russia, for their bombardment of Aleppo.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
796,RADDATZ,So this next question comes through social media through Facebook.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
797,RADDATZ,"Diane from Pennsylvania asks, if you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo?",0,20161010_2pres.tsv

802,CLINTON,And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
803,CLINTON,Russia hasn't paid any attention to ISIS.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
804,CLINTON,They're interested in keeping Assad in power.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv

806,CLINTON,"We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
807,CLINTON,And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
808,CLINTON,But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
809,CLINTON,"Russia has decided that it's all in, in Syria.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
810,CLINTON,"And they've also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it's not me.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
811,CLINTON,I've stood up to Russia.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv

813,CLINTON,"I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that's fine.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
814,CLINTON,And I did as secretary of state.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
815,CLINTON,That's how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons.,1,20161010_2pres.tsv
816,CLINTON,It's how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
817,CLINTON,So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv

852,TRUMP,I'm sure you probably have heard that.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
853,TRUMP,It was a disaster.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
854,TRUMP,"Because the fact is, almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it's been a disaster.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
855,TRUMP,"But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn't there, but possibly she's consulted.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv

885,TRUMP,We have people that want to fight both at the same time.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv

905,TRUMP,"Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
906,TRUMP,Why can't they do it quietly?,0,20161010_2pres.tsv

908,TRUMP,People leave.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv

918,TRUMP,"And we have -- look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv

927,TRUMP,They're gone.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
928,TRUMP,"Because everybody's talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
929,TRUMP,"Now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can't believe it.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv

931,TRUMP,"General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the Middle East.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv

935,RADDATZ,You talk about diplomatic efforts.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
936,RADDATZ,Those have failed.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
937,RADDATZ,Cease-fires have failed.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
938,RADDATZ,Would you introduce the threat of U.S. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime to back up diplomacy?,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
939,CLINTON,I would not use American ground forces in Syria.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
940,CLINTON,I think that would be a very serious mistake.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
941,CLINTON,"I don't think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
942,CLINTON,I don't think that is a smart strategy.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
943,CLINTON,"I do think the use of special forces, which we're using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just...",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
944,RADDATZ,But what would you do differently than President Obama is doing?,0,20161010_2pres.tsv

947,CLINTON,I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
948,CLINTON,I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
949,CLINTON,"And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
950,CLINTON,"No, he doesn't.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
951,CLINTON,"There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
952,CLINTON,And that takes a lot of planning and preparation.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
953,CLINTON,I would go after Baghdadi.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
954,CLINTON,"I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders -- and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones -- made a difference.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
955,CLINTON,So I think that could help.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
956,CLINTON,I would also consider arming the Kurds.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
957,CLINTON,"The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
958,CLINTON,"And I know there's a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv

1142,CLINTON,This is one of the most important issues in this election.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1143,CLINTON,"I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv

1158,RADDATZ,"Thank you, Secretary Clinton.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1159,RADDATZ,Thank you.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1160,RADDATZ,You're out of time.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1161,RADDATZ,Mr. Trump?,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1162,TRUMP,"Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1163,TRUMP,And we have a vacancy.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1164,TRUMP,I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1165,TRUMP,"I'm looking for judges -- and I've actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1166,TRUMP,But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1167,TRUMP,And I think that this is so important.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1168,TRUMP,"Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1169,TRUMP,"They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1170,TRUMP,So important to me.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1171,TRUMP,"Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1172,TRUMP,"So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in -- of my money, meaning I'm not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she's doing.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1173,TRUMP,What I ask is this.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1174,TRUMP,"So I'm putting in more than -- by the time it's finished, I'll have more than $100 million invested.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1175,TRUMP,Pretty much self-funding money.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1176,TRUMP,"We're raising money for the Republican Party, and we're doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1177,TRUMP,"I ask Hillary, why doesn't -- she made $250 million by being in office.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1178,TRUMP,She used the power of her office to make a lot of money.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1179,TRUMP,"Why isn't she funding, not for $100 million, but why don't you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1180,TRUMP,"It's $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1181,TRUMP,Why aren't you putting some money in?,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1182,TRUMP,You have a lot of it.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1183,TRUMP,You've made a lot of it because of the fact that you've been in office.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1184,TRUMP,"Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1185,TRUMP,So why aren't you putting money into your own campaign?,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1186,TRUMP,I'm just curious.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1187,CLINTON,Well...,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1188,SYSTEM,(CROSSTALK),0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1189,RADDATZ,Thank you very much.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1190,RADDATZ,We're going to get on to one more question.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1191,CLINTON,The question was about the Supreme Court.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1192,CLINTON,"And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1193,CLINTON,"But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1194,COOPER,Thank you.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1195,RADDATZ,"We have -- we have one more question, Mrs. Clinton.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1196,CLINTON,We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1197,COOPER,We have one more question from Ken Bone about energy policy.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1198,COOPER,Ken?,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1199,QUESTION,"What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1200,COOPER,"Mr. Trump, two minutes?",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1201,TRUMP,Absolutely.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1202,TRUMP,"I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1203,TRUMP,Under absolutely siege.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1204,TRUMP,"The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1205,TRUMP,And foreign companies are now coming in buying our -- buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1206,TRUMP,We are killing -- absolutely killing our energy business in this country.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1207,TRUMP,"Now, I'm all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1208,TRUMP,But we need much more than wind and solar.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1209,TRUMP,And you look at our miners.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1210,TRUMP,Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business.,1,20161010_2pres.tsv
1211,TRUMP,There is a thing called clean coal.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1212,TRUMP,"Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1213,TRUMP,Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1214,TRUMP,"We have unbelievable -- we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1215,TRUMP,So good.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1216,TRUMP,Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1217,TRUMP,I will bring our energy companies back.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1218,TRUMP,They'll be able to compete.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1219,TRUMP,They'll make money.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1220,TRUMP,They'll pay off our national debt.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1221,TRUMP,"They'll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1222,TRUMP,But we are putting our energy companies out of business.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1223,TRUMP,We have to bring back our workers.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1224,TRUMP,"You take a look at what's happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1225,TRUMP,We have to guard our energy companies.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1226,TRUMP,We have to make it possible.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1227,TRUMP,The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1228,TRUMP,"And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they're doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1229,TRUMP,It's a disgrace.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1230,COOPER,Your time is up.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1231,COOPER,Thank you.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1232,TRUMP,It's an absolute disgrace.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1233,COOPER,"Secretary Clinton, two minutes.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1234,CLINTON,"And actually -- well, that was very interesting.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1235,CLINTON,"First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1236,CLINTON,That's something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don't get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1237,CLINTON,"You know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business -- you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent.",1,20161010_2pres.tsv
1238,CLINTON,We are not dependent upon the Middle East.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1239,CLINTON,But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1240,CLINTON,So the price of oil has been way down.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1241,CLINTON,"And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right?",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1242,CLINTON,"We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1243,CLINTON,And I think that's an important transition.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1244,CLINTON,We've got to remain energy-independent.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1245,CLINTON,It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1246,CLINTON,We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1247,CLINTON,"So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1248,CLINTON,"And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1249,CLINTON,But I also want to be sure that we don't leave people behind.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1250,CLINTON,"That's why I'm the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1251,CLINTON,A lot of them lost their lives.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1252,CLINTON,"They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1253,CLINTON,I don't want to walk away from them.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1254,CLINTON,So we've got to do something for them.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1255,COOPER,Secretary Clinton...,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1256,CLINTON,But the price of coal is down worldwide.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1257,CLINTON,So we have to look at this comprehensively.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1258,COOPER,Your time is up.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1259,CLINTON,And that's exactly what I have proposed.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1260,CLINTON,I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1261,COOPER,Time is up.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1262,COOPER,We have time for one more...,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1263,RADDATZ,We have...,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1264,COOPER,One more audience question.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1265,RADDATZ,"We've sneaked in one more question, and it comes from Karl Becker.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1266,QUESTION,Good evening.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1267,QUESTION,"My question to both of you is, regardless of the current rhetoric, would either of you name one positive thing that you respect in one another?",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1268,SYSTEM,(APPLAUSE),0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1269,RADDATZ,"Mr. Trump, would you like to go first?",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1270,CLINTON,"Well, I certainly will, because I think that's a very fair and important question.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1271,CLINTON,"Look, I respect his children.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1272,CLINTON,"His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1273,CLINTON,"I don't agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1274,CLINTON,And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1275,CLINTON,"So I believe that this election has become in part so -- so conflict-oriented, so intense because there's a lot at stake.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1276,CLINTON,"This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1277,CLINTON,"We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1278,CLINTON,It's one of the most consequential elections that we've had.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1279,CLINTON,"And that's why I've tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1280,CLINTON,"And that's why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I've spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1281,CLINTON,And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1282,RADDATZ,Mr. Trump?,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1283,TRUMP,"Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1284,TRUMP,"I don't know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great -- I'm very proud of my children.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1285,TRUMP,"And they've done a wonderful job, and they've been wonderful, wonderful kids.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1286,TRUMP,So I consider that a compliment.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1287,TRUMP,I will say this about Hillary.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1288,TRUMP,She doesn't quit.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1289,TRUMP,She doesn't give up.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1290,TRUMP,I respect that.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1291,TRUMP,I tell it like it is.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1292,TRUMP,She's a fighter.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1293,TRUMP,I disagree with much of what she's fighting for.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1294,TRUMP,I do disagree with her judgment in many cases.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1295,TRUMP,"But she does fight hard, and she doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1296,TRUMP,And I consider that to be a very good trait.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1297,RADDATZ,Thanks to both of you.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1298,COOPER,We want to thank both the candidates.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1299,COOPER,We want to thank the university here.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1300,COOPER,This concludes the town hall meeting.,0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1301,COOPER,"Our thanks to the candidates, the commission, Washington University, and to everybody who watched.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1302,RADDATZ,"Please tune in on October 19th for the final presidential debate that will take place at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1303,RADDATZ,"Good night, everyone.",0,20161010_2pres.tsv
1,WALLACE,"Good evening from the Thomas and Mack Center at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
2,WALLACE,"I'm Chris Wallace of Fox News, and I welcome you to the third and final of the 2016 presidential debates between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
3,WALLACE,This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
4,WALLACE,"The commission has designed the format: Six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
5,WALLACE,Both campaigns have agreed to those rules.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
6,WALLACE,"For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
7,WALLACE,None of those questions has been shared with the commission or the two candidates.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
8,WALLACE,The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
9,WALLACE,"No cheers, boos, or other interruptions so we and you can focus on what the candidates have to say.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
10,WALLACE,"No noise, except right now, as we welcome the Democratic nominee for president, Secretary Clinton, and the Republican nominee for president, Mr. Trump.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
11,SYSTEM,(APPLAUSE),0,20161019_3pres.tsv
12,WALLACE,"Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, welcome.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
13,WALLACE,Let's get right to it.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
14,WALLACE,The first topic is the Supreme Court.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
15,WALLACE,"You both talked briefly about the court in the last debate, but I want to drill down on this, because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
16,WALLACE,"Which means that you will, in effect, determine the balance of the court for what could be the next quarter century.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
17,WALLACE,"First of all, where do you want to see the court take the country?",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
18,WALLACE,"And secondly, what's your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted?",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
19,WALLACE,Do the founders' words mean what they say or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances?,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
20,WALLACE,"In this segment, Secretary Clinton, you go first.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
21,WALLACE,You have two minutes.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
22,CLINTON,"Thank you very much, Chris.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
23,CLINTON,And thanks to UNLV for hosting us.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
24,CLINTON,"You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be?",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
25,CLINTON,What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens?,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
26,CLINTON,What kind of rights will Americans have?,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
27,CLINTON,"And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
28,CLINTON,"For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
29,CLINTON,I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
30,CLINTON,"But I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
31,CLINTON,"That's how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
32,CLINTON,And I look forward to having that opportunity.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
33,CLINTON,I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
34,CLINTON,That's the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
35,CLINTON,"The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
36,WALLACE,"Secretary Clinton, thank you.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
37,WALLACE,"Mr. Trump, same question.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
38,WALLACE,Where do you want to see the court take the country?,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
39,WALLACE,And how do you believe the Constitution should be interpreted?,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
40,TRUMP,"Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
41,TRUMP,The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
42,TRUMP,"Our country is so, so -- it's just so imperative that we have the right justices.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
43,TRUMP,"Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
44,TRUMP,And she was forced to apologize.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
45,TRUMP,And apologize she did.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
46,TRUMP,"But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
47,TRUMP,"We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
48,TRUMP,"I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
49,TRUMP,"But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
50,TRUMP,I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint -- and I've named 20 of them -- the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
51,TRUMP,They will have a conservative bent.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
52,TRUMP,They will be protecting the Second Amendment.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
53,TRUMP,"They are great scholars in all cases, and they're people of tremendous respect.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
54,TRUMP,They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
55,TRUMP,"And I believe that's very, very important.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
56,TRUMP,I don't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
57,TRUMP,"It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
58,TRUMP,And those are the people that I will appoint.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
59,WALLACE,"Mr. Trump, thank you.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
60,WALLACE,We now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
61,WALLACE,"I want to focus on two issues that, in fact, by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
62,WALLACE,"First is one that you mentioned, Mr. Trump, and that is guns.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
63,WALLACE,"Secretary Clinton, you said last year, let me quote, ""The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment.""",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
64,WALLACE,"And now, in fact, in the 2008 Heller case, the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms, but a right that is reasonably limited.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
65,WALLACE,Those were the words of the Judge Antonin Scalia who wrote the decision.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
66,WALLACE,What's wrong with that?,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
67,CLINTON,"Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
68,CLINTON,I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
69,CLINTON,I represented upstate New York.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
70,CLINTON,I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
71,CLINTON,It goes back to the founding of our country.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
72,CLINTON,But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
73,CLINTON,"Because I support the Second Amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
74,CLINTON,"And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns.",1,20161019_3pres.tsv
75,CLINTON,"I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
76,CLINTON,There's other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
77,CLINTON,You mentioned the Heller decision.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
78,CLINTON,"And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them.",1,20161019_3pres.tsv
79,CLINTON,"And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
80,CLINTON,So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
81,WALLACE,Let me bring Mr. Trump in here.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
82,WALLACE,"The bipartisan Open Debate Coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here, and this was, in fact, one of the top questions that they got.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
83,WALLACE,How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected?,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
84,WALLACE,You just heard Secretary Clinton's answer.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
85,WALLACE,"Does she persuade you that, while you may disagree on regulation, that, in fact, she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms?",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
86,TRUMP,"Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly -- and she was extremely angry about it.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
87,TRUMP,I watched.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
88,TRUMP,"I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
89,TRUMP,And Justice Scalia was so involved.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
90,TRUMP,And it was a well-crafted decision.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
91,TRUMP,"But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
92,TRUMP,And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
93,WALLACE,"Well, let me bring in Secretary Clinton.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
94,WALLACE,Were you extremely upset?,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
95,CLINTON,"Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
96,CLINTON,"But there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
97,CLINTON,"That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
98,CLINTON,"And, you know, look, I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the NRA.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
99,CLINTON,The gun lobby's on his side.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
100,CLINTON,They're running millions of dollars of ads against me.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
101,CLINTON,"And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
102,CLINTON,"But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
103,WALLACE,"Let me bring Mr. Trump back into this, because, in fact, you oppose any limits on assault weapons, any limits on high- capacity magazines.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
104,WALLACE,You support a national right to carry law.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
105,WALLACE,"Why, sir?",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
106,TRUMP,"Well, let me just tell you before we go any further.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
107,TRUMP,"In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city.",1,20161019_3pres.tsv
108,TRUMP,"So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.",1,20161019_3pres.tsv
109,TRUMP,I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
110,TRUMP,"And I am -- I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
111,TRUMP,And it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
112,TRUMP,So I'm very honored by all of that.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
113,TRUMP,We are going to appoint justices -- this is the best way to help the Second Amendment.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
114,TRUMP,"We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
115,WALLACE,"Well, let's pick up on another issue which divides you and the justices that whoever ends up winning this election appoints could have a dramatic effect there, and that's the issue of abortion.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
116,TRUMP,Right.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
117,WALLACE,"Mr. Trump, you're pro-life.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
118,WALLACE,"But I want to ask you specifically: Do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v. Wade, which includes -- in fact, states -- a woman's right to abortion?",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
119,TRUMP,"Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
120,WALLACE,But I'm asking you specifically.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
121,WALLACE,Would you like to...,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
122,TRUMP,"If they overturned it, it will go back to the states.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
123,WALLACE,"But what I'm asking you, sir, is, do you want to see the court overturn -- you just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
124,WALLACE,Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade?,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
125,TRUMP,"Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
126,TRUMP,"And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
127,TRUMP,"I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
128,WALLACE,Secretary Clinton?,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
129,CLINTON,"Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
130,CLINTON,"And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
131,CLINTON,It is about what's happening right now in America.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
132,CLINTON,"So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
133,CLINTON,Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.,1,20161019_3pres.tsv
134,CLINTON,He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood.,1,20161019_3pres.tsv
135,CLINTON,I will defend Planned Parenthood.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
136,CLINTON,"I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
137,WALLACE,Secretary Clinton…,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
138,CLINTON,And we have come too far to have that turned back now.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
139,WALLACE,"And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions.",1,20161019_3pres.tsv
140,WALLACE,And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
141,WALLACE,"I'm going to give you a chance to respond, but I want to ask you, Secretary Clinton, I want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
142,WALLACE,You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
143,WALLACE,"You also voted against a ban on late-term, partial-birth abortions.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
144,WALLACE,Why?,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
145,CLINTON,Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
146,CLINTON,"And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
147,CLINTON,"The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
148,CLINTON,"I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
149,CLINTON,I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
150,CLINTON,So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
151,WALLACE,"Mr. Trump, your reaction?",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
152,WALLACE,"And particularly on this issue of late-term, partial-birth abortions.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
153,TRUMP,"Well, I think it's terrible.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
154,TRUMP,"If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.",1,20161019_3pres.tsv
155,TRUMP,"Now, you can say that that's OK and Hillary can say that that's OK.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
156,TRUMP,"But it's not OK with me, because based on what she's saying, and based on where she's going, and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day.",1,20161019_3pres.tsv
157,TRUMP,And that's not acceptable.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
158,CLINTON,"Well, that is not what happens in these cases.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
159,CLINTON,And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
160,CLINTON,"You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
161,CLINTON,This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
162,CLINTON,And I do not believe the government should be making it.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
163,CLINTON,"You know, I've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
164,CLINTON,"I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
165,CLINTON,"And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
166,CLINTON,And I will stand up for that right.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
167,WALLACE,All right.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
168,WALLACE,"But just briefly, I want to move on to another segment...",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
169,TRUMP,"And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
170,TRUMP,Nobody has that.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
171,WALLACE,All right.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
172,WALLACE,Let's move on to the subject of immigration.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
173,WALLACE,And there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
174,WALLACE,"Actually, there are a lot of issues that separate the two of you.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
175,WALLACE,"Mr. Trump, you want to build a wall.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
176,WALLACE,"Secretary Clinton, you have offered no specific plan for how you want to secure our southern border.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
177,WALLACE,"Mr. Trump, you are calling for major deportations.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
178,WALLACE,"Secretary Clinton, you say that within your first 100 days as president you're going to offer a package that includes a pathway to citizenship.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
179,WALLACE,"The question, really, is, why are you right and your opponent wrong?",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
180,WALLACE,"Mr. Trump, you go first in this segment.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
181,WALLACE,You have two minutes.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
182,TRUMP,"Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
183,TRUMP,We need strong borders.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
184,TRUMP,"In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of -- I mean, these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
185,TRUMP,You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
186,TRUMP,They're coming in illegally.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
187,TRUMP,Drugs are pouring in through the border.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
188,TRUMP,We have no country if we have no border.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
189,TRUMP,Hillary wants to give amnesty.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
190,TRUMP,She wants to have open borders.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
191,TRUMP,"The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
192,TRUMP,First time they've ever endorsed a candidate.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
193,TRUMP,It means their job is tougher.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
194,TRUMP,But they know what's going on.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
195,TRUMP,They know it better than anybody.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
196,TRUMP,They want strong borders.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
197,TRUMP,They feel we have to have strong borders.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
198,TRUMP,I was up in New Hampshire the other day.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
199,TRUMP,"The biggest complaint they have -- it's with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
200,TRUMP,All of the problems -- the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
201,TRUMP,It's just pouring and destroying their youth.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
202,TRUMP,It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
203,TRUMP,We have to have strong borders.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
204,TRUMP,We have to keep the drugs out of our country.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
205,TRUMP,"We are -- right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
206,TRUMP,We need strong borders.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
207,TRUMP,We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
208,TRUMP,"Now, I want to build the wall.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
209,TRUMP,We need the wall.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
210,TRUMP,"And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
211,TRUMP,We stop the drugs.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
212,TRUMP,We shore up the border.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
213,TRUMP,"One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
214,TRUMP,We're going to get them out; we're going to secure the border.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
215,TRUMP,"And once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
216,TRUMP,"But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
217,WALLACE,"Mr. Trump, thank you.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
218,WALLACE,"Same question to you, Secretary Clinton.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
219,WALLACE,"Basically, why are you right and Mr. Trump is wrong?",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
220,CLINTON,"Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
221,CLINTON,"They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
222,CLINTON,And you're right.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
223,CLINTON,I don't want to rip families apart.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
224,CLINTON,I don't want to be sending parents away from children.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
225,CLINTON,I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
226,CLINTON,We have 11 million undocumented people.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
227,CLINTON,"They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
228,CLINTON,He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
229,CLINTON,"Now, here's what that means.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
230,CLINTON,"It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
231,CLINTON,"And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
232,CLINTON,I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
233,CLINTON,I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
234,CLINTON,I have been for border security for years.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
235,CLINTON,I voted for border security in the United States Senate.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
236,CLINTON,And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
237,CLINTON,But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv

454,CLINTON,"I would work with our allies in Asia, in Europe, in the Middle East, and elsewhere.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
455,CLINTON,That's the only way we're going to be able to keep the peace.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
456,WALLACE,"We're going to -- no, we are going to move on to the next topic, which is the economy.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
457,WALLACE,And I hope we handle that as well as we did immigration.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
458,WALLACE,You also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
459,WALLACE,"Secretary Clinton, in your plan, government plays a big role.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
460,WALLACE,"You see more government spending, more entitlements, more tax credits, more tax penalties.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
461,WALLACE,"Mr. Trump, you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
462,TRUMP,Yes.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
463,WALLACE,We're going to drill down into this a little bit more.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
464,WALLACE,"But in this overview, please explain to me why you believe that your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponent's plan will not.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
465,WALLACE,"In this round, you go first, Secretary Clinton.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
466,CLINTON,"Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
467,CLINTON,"And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
468,CLINTON,"I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
469,CLINTON,"I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
470,CLINTON,"New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
471,CLINTON,I want us to do more to help small business.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
472,CLINTON,That's where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
473,CLINTON,"I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not -- who work full-time should not still be in poverty.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
474,CLINTON,And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
475,CLINTON,I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
476,CLINTON,"That's why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
477,CLINTON,"I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
478,CLINTON,"And we're going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
479,CLINTON,Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
480,CLINTON,So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
481,CLINTON,We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
482,CLINTON,That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs.,1,20161019_3pres.tsv
483,CLINTON,"By contrast, Donald's plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs.",1,20161019_3pres.tsv
484,CLINTON,Why?,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
485,CLINTON,"Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
486,CLINTON,So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
487,CLINTON,The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
488,WALLACE,"Secretary, thank you.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
489,WALLACE,"Mr. Trump, why will your plan create more jobs and growth than Secretary Clinton's?",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
490,TRUMP,"Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
491,TRUMP,Her tax plan is a disaster.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
492,TRUMP,And she can say all she wants about college tuition.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
493,TRUMP,And I'm a big proponent.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
494,TRUMP,We're going to do a lot of things for college tuition.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
495,TRUMP,But the rest of the public's going to be paying for it.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
496,TRUMP,"We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan.",1,20161019_3pres.tsv
497,TRUMP,"But I'd like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I'm -- not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
498,TRUMP,"Saudi Arabia, nothing but money.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
499,TRUMP,We protect Saudi Arabia.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
500,TRUMP,Why aren't they paying?,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
501,TRUMP,"She immediately -- when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
502,TRUMP,Why aren't the NATO questioned -- why aren't they paying?,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
503,TRUMP,Because they weren't paying.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
504,TRUMP,"Since I did this -- this was a year ago -- all of a sudden, they're paying.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
505,TRUMP,And I've been given a lot -- a lot of credit for it.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
506,TRUMP,"All of a sudden, they're starting to pay up.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
507,TRUMP,They have to pay up.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
508,TRUMP,"We're protecting people, they have to pay up.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
509,TRUMP,And I'm a big fan of NATO.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
510,TRUMP,But they have to pay up.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
511,TRUMP,"She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
512,TRUMP,"Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
513,TRUMP,"We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
514,TRUMP,"We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt.",1,20161019_3pres.tsv
515,TRUMP,We're up to $20 trillion.,1,20161019_3pres.tsv
516,TRUMP,So my plan -- we're going to renegotiate trade deals.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
517,TRUMP,We're going to have a lot of free trade.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
518,TRUMP,"We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
519,TRUMP,But we have horrible deals.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
520,TRUMP,"Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever.",1,20161019_3pres.tsv

526,TRUMP,I am going to renegotiate NAFTA.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv

541,CLINTON,"the fact is, he's going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv

545,CLINTON,"He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt.",1,20161019_3pres.tsv
546,CLINTON,"Well, he mentioned the debt.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
547,CLINTON,We know how to get control of the debt.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
548,CLINTON,"When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
549,CLINTON,"When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
550,CLINTON,He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
551,CLINTON,"So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
552,CLINTON,"So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv

555,CLINTON,"Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we've tried that.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
556,CLINTON,It has not worked the way that it has been promised.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
557,WALLACE,"Secretary Clinton, I want to pursue your plan, because in many ways it is similar to the Obama stimulus plan in 2009, which has led to the slowest GDP growth since 1949.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
558,TRUMP,Correct.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
559,WALLACE,"Thank you, sir.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
560,WALLACE,You told me in July when we spoke that the problem is that President Obama didn't get to do enough in what he was trying to do with his stimulus.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv

562,CLINTON,"Well, it's a combination, Chris.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
563,CLINTON,"And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
564,CLINTON,I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
565,CLINTON,I've never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
566,CLINTON,I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
567,CLINTON,He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
568,CLINTON,But it was a terrible recession.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
569,CLINTON,"So now we've dug ourselves out of it, we're standing, but we're not yet running.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
570,CLINTON,"So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
571,CLINTON,That is not going to work.,0,20161019_3pres.tsv
572,CLINTON,"That's why what I have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv
573,CLINTON,"We're beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs.",0,20161019_3pres.tsv

526,TRUMP,"And it’s a beautiful, vibrant — this is an amazing place.",0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
527,TRUMP,But they are really having trouble over in Venezuela.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
528,TRUMP,"But Miami is filled with hardworking, incredible Venezuelan people.",0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
529,TRUMP,But it’s been hurt very badly by Socialist Venezuela.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
530,TRUMP,And the next president of the United States must stand in solidarity with all people oppressed in our atmosphere.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
531,TRUMP,And we will stand with oppressed people.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
532,TRUMP,And there are many.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
533,TRUMP,"The oppressed people of Venezuela, they are yearning to be free.",0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
534,TRUMP,They are yearning for help.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
535,TRUMP,The system is bad.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
536,TRUMP,But the people are great.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv

548,TRUMP,"And yet — it’ll be the greatest cut, I believe, in the history of our country.",0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
549,TRUMP,"But I will tell you what surprises me tremendously is that the people that have these cuts, they’re more concerned with regulation than even a big tax decrease because regulations are choking and killing our businesses and stopping our businesses from hiring people, jobs.",0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
550,TRUMP,So I’m going to appoint justices of the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv

575,TRUMP,So we’re going to protect your Second Amendment.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv

584,TRUMP,We’re going to make great deals out of horrible deals.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
585,TRUMP,"And if we can’t renegotiate the deal because the other side is so, so happy with it, we’re going to terminate the deal and we’ll start all over again, folks.",0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
586,TRUMP,We’ll have new deals.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
587,TRUMP,And they’ll be much better deals.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv

589,TRUMP,"The traffic, it’ll be coming our way.",0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
590,TRUMP,It’s a one-way street out of the United States for our jobs and our money.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv

601,TRUMP,That’s on top of spending billions and billions of dollars.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
602,TRUMP,And then you wonder why I’m winning in Michigan.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
603,TRUMP,Because I’ve been telling the people in Michigan.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
604,TRUMP,I’ve been telling the people in Ohio for five years that this is happening.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
605,TRUMP,And our politicians don’t do anything about it.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
606,TRUMP,And Hillary Clinton will never do anything about it.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
607,TRUMP,She doesn’t have the capability to do it.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
608,TRUMP,"We will rebuild our roads and bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.",0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv

613,TRUMP,American steel will send new skyscrapers right here in Miami into the clouds.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv

615,TRUMP,American hands will rebuild this nation.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
616,TRUMP,And American energy mined from American sources will power our energy.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv

618,TRUMP,"And we’ll take care of our miners who have been destroyed by this administration, destroyed.",0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
619,TRUMP,And Hillary Clinton has already said she’s going to put the miners out of business.,1,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
620,TRUMP,We’re going to take care of our miners.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv

624,TRUMP,I will fight for every neglected part of this nation.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
625,TRUMP,And I will fight to bring us all together as one people.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
626,TRUMP,"Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one flag.",0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
627,TRUMP,"It’s time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.",0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv
628,TRUMP,We’re not prosperous anymore.,0,20180916_trump_miami.tsv

5,TRUMP,It’s a lot of people.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
6,TRUMP,A lot of media.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
7,SYSTEM,(LAUGHTER),0,20180926_un_press.tsv
8,TRUMP,We’ve covered a great deal of territory.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
9,TRUMP,"Just left, as you know, Prime Minister Abe of Japan.",0,20180926_un_press.tsv
10,TRUMP,We’re starting trade talks with Japan.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
11,TRUMP,"They were not willing, for years, to talk trade, and now they’re willing to talk trade.",0,20180926_un_press.tsv
12,TRUMP,And I’m sure we’ll make a very good deal.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
13,TRUMP,"Just concluded, as you know — two days ago, signed a deal with South Korea — a trade deal.",0,20180926_un_press.tsv
14,TRUMP,A tremendous deal with South Korea.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
15,TRUMP,It means a lot of business for our farmers.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
16,TRUMP,We’re opening up for farmers.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
17,TRUMP,We’re opening up for a lot of different groups.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
18,TRUMP,We’re going to be able to sell much more than double the number of automobiles that we were allowed under a deal that was totally defective that was there before.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
19,TRUMP,And so we’re very happy with that.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
20,TRUMP,That deal is actually concluded.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
21,TRUMP,We’re very well along the way with Mexico.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
22,TRUMP,The relationship is very good.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
23,TRUMP,"And with Canada, we’ll see what happens.",0,20180926_un_press.tsv
24,TRUMP,They’re charging us 300-percent tariffs on dairy products.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
25,TRUMP,We can’t have that.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
26,TRUMP,We can’t have that.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
27,TRUMP,"With China, as you know, we put out an announcement today.",0,20180926_un_press.tsv
28,TRUMP,They would like to see me lose an election because they’ve never been challenged like this.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
29,TRUMP,But I want to open up China to our farmers and to our industrialists and our companies.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
30,TRUMP,"And China is not open, but we’re open to them.",0,20180926_un_press.tsv
31,TRUMP,"They charge us 25, 35, 55 percent for things, and we charge them nothing in terms of coming into the country.",0,20180926_un_press.tsv
32,TRUMP,"Cars, they’re at 25 percent.",0,20180926_un_press.tsv
33,TRUMP,"And we’re at 2 percent and 2.5 percent, and don’t even collect it.",0,20180926_un_press.tsv
34,TRUMP,But we collect it now.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
35,TRUMP,So we’re doing very well in our situation with China on trade.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
36,TRUMP,"I have a great relationship with the President of China, President Xi.",0,20180926_un_press.tsv
37,TRUMP,But it’s got to be a two-way street.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
38,TRUMP,"It — for 25 years and longer, it was not.",0,20180926_un_press.tsv
39,TRUMP,And trillions and trillions of dollars was taken out of the United States for the benefit of China.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
40,TRUMP,We just can’t have that.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
41,TRUMP,We have to make it fair.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
42,TRUMP,"So we’re at $250 billion now, at 25 percent interest.",0,20180926_un_press.tsv
43,TRUMP,And a lot of money is coming into our coffers.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
44,TRUMP,"And it’s had no impact on our — absolutely, by the way, no impact on our economy, which I said it wouldn’t.",0,20180926_un_press.tsv
45,TRUMP,"In fact, steel is like the hottest industry there is.",0,20180926_un_press.tsv
46,TRUMP,"If you look at what happened with steel, we’re charging a 25 percent tariff for the dumpers.",0,20180926_un_press.tsv
47,TRUMP,They dump massive amounts of steel.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
48,TRUMP,They want to put the steel companies out of business.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
49,TRUMP,"And after they’re out of business, they’ll come in and charge five times more than you ever thought possible.",0,20180926_un_press.tsv
50,TRUMP,And we need steel and we need aluminum.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
51,TRUMP,And those industries are doing well.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
52,TRUMP,But steel is incredible.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
53,TRUMP,U.S. Steel is opening up a minimum of eight plants.,1,20180926_un_press.tsv
54,TRUMP,Nucor is opening up plants.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
55,TRUMP,"And these are big plants — $750 million and a billion dollar plants, in some cases.",0,20180926_un_press.tsv
56,TRUMP,So what’s happening with the steel industry is very exciting to me.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
57,TRUMP,It’s being rebuilt overnight.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
58,TRUMP,"If you look at the miners in coal, if you look at energy, LNG — Japan just gave us some numbers that are incredible.",0,20180926_un_press.tsv
59,TRUMP,They’re doubling the amount that they are going to be buying for Japan.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
60,TRUMP,They’re taking the LNG and they’re doubling it up.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
61,TRUMP,"I said, ""You have to do me a favor. We don’t want these big deficits. You’re going to have to buy more""",0,20180926_un_press.tsv
62,TRUMP,"They’re buying massive amounts of equipment and military equipment, and other countries are doing the same thing.",0,20180926_un_press.tsv
63,TRUMP,Because we have trade imbalances with almost everybody.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
64,TRUMP,It’s a rare exception that we don’t.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
65,TRUMP,So we are doing great as a country.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
66,TRUMP,"Unfortunately, they just raised interest rates a little bit because we are doing so well.",0,20180926_un_press.tsv
67,TRUMP,"I’m not happy about that, because I know it’s going to be a question.",0,20180926_un_press.tsv
68,TRUMP,I am not happy about that.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
69,TRUMP,"I’d rather pay down debt or do other things, create more jobs.",0,20180926_un_press.tsv
70,TRUMP,So I’m worried about the fact that they seem to like raising interest rates.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
71,TRUMP,We can do other things with the money.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
72,TRUMP,And — but they raised them.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
73,TRUMP,And they’re raising them because we’re doing so well.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
74,TRUMP,"You know, we’re doing much better than I had projected in terms of — when I was campaigning, I said we were going to do this and we’re doing much better than anybody ever thought possible.",0,20180926_un_press.tsv
75,TRUMP,"And, I will say, if others got in, it would have been just the opposite because they were going to put restrictions on.",0,20180926_un_press.tsv
76,TRUMP,They were going to put regulations on.,0,20180926_un_press.tsv
77,TRUMP,"They were going to choke the economy as it was already choking, but it would have been worse.",0,20180926_un_press.tsv

129,TRUMP,"And you have 300,000, 400,000, 500,000 people working for these companies, and all of a sudden it became like a big waterfall, a big, beautiful waterfall where so many companies are doing it.",0,20182601_trump_world.tsv

138,TRUMP,Nobody ever thought of this as a possibility even.,0,20182601_trump_world.tsv

42,TRUMP,The federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security.,0,20190108_oval_office.tsv
43,TRUMP,My administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation.,0,20190108_oval_office.tsv
