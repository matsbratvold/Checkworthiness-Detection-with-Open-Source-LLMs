9,CLINTON,"You know, the American president has to both keep our families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone, not just those at the top.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv

12,CLINTON,I'm very clear that we have a distinct difference between those of us on this stage tonight and all of our Republican counterparts.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
13,CLINTON,"From my perspective, we have to prevent the Republicans from rolling back the progress that we've made.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
14,CLINTON,"They would repeal the Affordable Care Act, not improve it.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
15,CLINTON,"They would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and corporations, not to the middle class.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
16,CLINTON,"And they would, despite all their tough talk about terrorism, continue to let people who are on the no-fly list buy guns.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
17,CLINTON,"So we have a lot of work to do in this campaign to make it clear where we stand in the Democratic Party, what we will do for our country, and I look forward to this evening's discussion of real issues that face the American people.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv

22,O'MALLEY,"Martha, thank you.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
23,O'MALLEY,"Tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far, because tonight is different because of this reason, that in the course of this presidential campaign America has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists, American lives taken from us.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
24,O'MALLEY,"So, yes, we must talk about our ideas to move our economy forward, but the first job of the president of the United States is to protect the people of the United States.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
25,O'MALLEY,I visited with a number of our neighbors in Northern Virginia at a mosque last Friday.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
26,O'MALLEY,"And as I looked out there at the eyes of our neighbors, I also looked in the eyes of veterans.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
27,O'MALLEY,I looked into the eyes of Boy Scouts.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
28,O'MALLEY,I looked into the eyes of moms and dads who would do anything in their power to protect our country's values and our freedoms.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
29,O'MALLEY,"What our nation needs right now is to realize that, while we face a terrible danger, we also face a different sort of political danger.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
30,O'MALLEY,And that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
31,O'MALLEY,What our country needs right now is new leadership that will bring us together around the values that unite us and the freedoms that we share as Americans.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
32,O'MALLEY,We will rise to challenge of ISIL and we will rise together to the challenges that we face in our economy.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
33,O'MALLEY,"But we will only do so if we hold true to the values and the freedoms that unite us, which means we must never surrender them to terrorists, must never surrender our Americans values to racist, must never surrender to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
34,O'MALLEY,We are a better country than this.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv

38,MUIR,Senator Sanders.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
39,SANDERS,Good evening.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
40,SANDERS,I am running for president of the United States because it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
41,SANDERS,I'm running for president because our economy is rigged because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
42,SANDERS,I'm running for president because I'm going to create an economy that works for working families not just billionaires.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
43,SANDERS,"I'm running for president because we have a campaign finance system which is corrupt, where billionaires are spending hundreds of millionaires of dollars to buy candidates who will represent their interests rather than the middle class and working families.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
44,SANDERS,I'm running because we need to address the planetary crisis of climate change and take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
45,SANDERS,"I'm running for president because I want a new foreign policy; one that takes on Isis, one that destroys ISIS, but one that does not get us involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East but rather works around a major coalition of wealthy and powerful nations supporting Muslim troops on the ground.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
46,SANDERS,That's the kind of coalition we need and that's the kind of coalition I will put together.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
47,SYSTEM,(APPLAUSE),0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
48,MUIR,Senator Sanders thank you and thank you all.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
49,MUIR,We do have a lot of important issues to get here tonight and we want to address the controversy of the last 24 hours right off the top because we heard some of the most heated rhetoric of the campaign so far between two of the campaigns on this stage tonight.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
50,MUIR,"Senator Sanders, you fired a campaign staffer you have sued the Democratic National Committee; all of this after your campaign acknowledge that some of your staffers quote, ""irresponsibly accessed data from another campaign.""",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
51,MUIR,"The Clinton campaign called this a very egregious breech of data of ethics and said, quote, ""our data was stolen.""",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
52,MUIR,Did they overstate this or were your staffers essentially stealing part of the Clinton playbook?,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
53,SANDERS,"David, let me give you a little bit of background here.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
54,SANDERS,The DNC has hired vendors.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
55,SANDERS,"On two occasions, there were breeches in information two months ago.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
56,SANDERS,Our staff found information on our computers from the Clinton campaign.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
57,SANDERS,"And when our staffers said, ""whoa, what's going here?""",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
58,SANDERS,They went to the DNC quietly.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
59,SANDERS,"They went to the vendor and said, ""hey, something is wrong,"" and that was quietly dealt with.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
60,SANDERS,None of that information was looked at.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
61,SANDERS,Our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
62,SANDERS,A few days ago a similar incident happened.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
63,SANDERS,"There was a breach because the DNC vendor screwed up, information came to our campaign.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
64,SANDERS,"In this case, our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked a that information.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
65,SANDERS,As soon as we learned that they looked at that information - we fired that person.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
66,SANDERS,We are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
67,SANDERS,"Thirdly, what I have a really problem, and as you mentioned - this is a problem, I recognize it as a problem.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
68,SANDERS,But what the DNC did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
69,SANDERS,That is an egregious act.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
70,SANDERS,"I'm glad that late last night, that was resolved.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
71,SANDERS,"Fourthly, I work -- look forward to working with Secretary Clinton for an investigation, an independent investigation, about all of the breaches that have occurred from day one in this campaign, because I am not convinced that information from our campaign may not have ended up in her campaign.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
72,SANDERS,Don't know that.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
73,SANDERS,"But we need an independent investigation, and I hope Secretary Clinton will agree with me for the need of that.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
74,SANDERS,Last point.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
75,SANDERS,"When we saw the breach two months, we didn't go running to the media and make a big deal about it.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
76,SANDERS,"And it bothers me very much that, rather than working on this issue to resolve it, it has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign later.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
77,MUIR,"But Senator, you do mention the DNC -- the vender.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
78,MUIR,But you said of your staff that they did the wrong thing.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
79,SANDERS,Absolutely.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
80,SANDERS,Bernie Sanders apologizes to Hillary Clinton,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
81,SANDERS,"At ABC's Democratic presidential debate, candidate Bernie Sanders apologizes to rival Hillary Clinton for a scandal involving key voter data.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
82,MUIR,"So, does Secretary Clinton deserve an apology tonight?",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
83,SANDERS,"Yes, I apologize.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
84,MUIR,Secretary Clinton...,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
85,SYSTEM,(APPLAUSE),0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
86,SANDERS,Not only -- not only do I apologize to Secretary Clinton -- and I hope we can work together on an independent investigation from day one -- I want to apologize to my supporters.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
87,SANDERS,This is not the type of campaign that we run.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
88,SANDERS,"And if I find anybody else involved in this, they will also be fired.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
89,MUIR,"Secretary Clinton, he has apologized.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
90,MUIR,How do your react?,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
91,CLINTON,"I very much appreciate that comment, Bernie.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
92,CLINTON,It really is important that we go forward on this.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
93,CLINTON,"I know that you now have your data back, and that there has been an agreement for an independent inquiry into what did happen.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
94,CLINTON,"Obviously, we were distressed when we learned of it, because we have worked very hard -- I said in the beginning of this campaign, we want to reach as many voters as possible, and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that, and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
95,CLINTON,"And so, now that, I think, you know, we have resolved your data, we have agreed on an independent inquiry, we should move on.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
96,CLINTON,Because I don't think the American people are all that interested in this.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
97,SYSTEM,(APPLAUSE),0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
98,CLINTON,I think they're more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
99,O'MALLEY,"Yeah, David, look, for crying out loud, our country has been attacked, we have pressing issues involving how we're going to adapt to this changing era of warfare.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
100,O'MALLEY,Our economy -- people are working harder and being left behind.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
101,O'MALLEY,You want to know why things don't get done in Washington?,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
102,O'MALLEY,"Because for the last 24 hours, with those issues being so urgent to people as they tune in tonight, wondering how they're even be able to buy presents for their kids.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
103,O'MALLEY,"Instead, we're listening to the bickering back and forth.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
104,O'MALLEY,"Maybe that is normal politics in Washington, but that is not the politics of higher purpose that people expect from our party.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
105,O'MALLEY,"We need to address our security issues, we need to address the economic issues around the kitchen table.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
106,O'MALLEY,"And if people want a more high-minded politics and want to move our country forward, go on to martinomalley.com and help my campaign move our country forward.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
107,SYSTEM,(APPLAUSE),0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
108,MUIR,All three candidates are weighing in.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
109,SANDERS,Let me agree with Governor O'Malley and let me agree with Secretary Clinton.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
110,SANDERS,"You know, we had this incident before, Secretary, with your famous e-mails.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
111,SANDERS,Right?,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
112,SANDERS,"And what I said and I think what Governor O'Malley is saying, and I hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
113,SANDERS,Media notwithstanding.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
114,SANDERS,Those are the issues that the American people want discussed.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
115,SANDERS,I hope those are the issues we'll discuss.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
116,MUIR,"Good let's move on -- Senator Sanders, let's move on right to some of those issues.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
117,SYSTEM,(APPLAUSE),0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
118,MUIR,"It is just six days before Christmas, as we all know in this country.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
119,MUIR,"It's typically a joyful time, as it is this year, as well.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
120,MUIR,But it's also an anxious time.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
121,MUIR,President Obama has acknowledged that what we saw in San Bernardino was an act of terrorism.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
122,MUIR,"But we remember the president said, right before Thanksgiving, there is no known specific and credible intelligence indicating a plot on the homeland.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
123,MUIR,We now know that this couple had assembled an arsenal.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
124,MUIR,They were not on law enforcement's radar.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
125,MUIR,They were completely undetected.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
126,MUIR,"So as we approach another holiday, with the president again saying, late this week, no credible threat, Secretary Clinton, how confident should the American people be, that there aren't others like that couple right now in the U.S. going undetected?",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
127,MUIR,And what would you do as president to find them?,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
128,CLINTON,"Well, first, the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of America safe.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
129,CLINTON,I have a plan that I've put forward to go after ISIS.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
130,CLINTON,"Not to contain them, but to defeat them.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
131,CLINTON,And it has three parts.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
132,CLINTON,"First, to go after them and deprive them of the territory they occupy now in both Syria and Iraq.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
133,CLINTON,"Secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
134,CLINTON,"And thirdly, to do more to keep us safe.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
135,CLINTON,"Under each of those three parts of my plan, I have very specific recommendations about what to do.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
136,CLINTON,"Obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an American-led air campaign, we have to have Arab and Kurdish troops on the ground.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
137,CLINTON,"Secondly, we've got to go after everything from North Africa to South Asia and beyond.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
138,CLINTON,"And then, most importantly, here at home, I think there are three things that we have to get right.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
139,CLINTON,We have to do the best possible job of sharing intelligence and information.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
140,CLINTON,"That now includes the internet, because we have seen that ISIS is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
141,CLINTON,That means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
142,CLINTON,"They can't see the government as an adversary, we can't see them as obstructionists.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
143,CLINTON,We've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
144,CLINTON,And we must work more closely with Muslim-American communities.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
145,CLINTON,"Just like Martin, I met with a group of Muslim-Americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
146,CLINTON,They will be our early warning signal.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
147,CLINTON,"That's why we need to work with them, not demonize them, as the Republicans have been doing.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
148,O'MALLEY,"David, I am the very first...",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
149,MUIR,(inaudible) thank you.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
150,SYSTEM,(APPLAUSE),0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
151,MUIR,I am the very first post-9/11 mayor and the very first post-9/11 governor.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
152,MUIR,"I understand, from the ground up, that when attacks like San Bernardino happen, when attacks like the attacks of 9/11 happen, that when people call 911, the first people to show up are the local first responders.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
153,MUIR,"Many of the things Secretary Clinton said are absolutely true, but they underscore a lack of investment that we have, as a nation, failed to make over these last 15 years in intelligence gathering, intelligence analysis, intelligence sharing.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
154,MUIR,"Not only in theater, in Syria and Iraq and other places where we embalk (ph) ourselves in toppling dictators without having any idea what comes next, but here in the homeland, as we protect people from this threat of the lone wolves and these changing tactics and strategies.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
155,MUIR,"I believe that what's happened here is that the president had us on the right course, but it's a lack of battle tempo.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
156,MUIR,"We have to increase the battle tempo, we have to bring a modern way of getting things done and forcing the sharing of information and do a much better job of acting on it in order to prevent these sorts of attacks in the future.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
157,MUIR,"And we're going to break down these issues tonight, but I do want to go to Senator Sanders because the concern going into Christmas is significant, as you know.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
158,MUIR,A new ABC News poll shows 77 percent of Americans have little or no confidence in the government's ability to prevent a lone wolf attack.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
159,MUIR,How would you specifically find would-be terrorist who are going undetected?,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
160,SANDERS,I'm one of the 77 percent.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
161,SANDERS,I think this is a very difficult issue.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
162,SANDERS,Let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
163,SANDERS,Let me tell you what I think we have got to do.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
164,SANDERS,I think it's a two-pronged issue.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
165,SANDERS,"Number one, our goal is to crush and destroy ISIS.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
166,SANDERS,What is the best way to do it?,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
167,SANDERS,"Well, I think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
168,SANDERS,I voted against the war in Iraq because I thought unilateral military action would not produce the results that were necessary and would lead to the kind of unraveling and instability that we saw in the Middle East.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
169,SANDERS,I do not believe in unilateral American action.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
170,SANDERS,"I believe in action in which we put together a strong coalition of forces, major powers and the Muslim nations.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
171,SANDERS,"I think one of the heroes in a real quagmire out there, in a dangerous and difficult world, one of the heroes who we should recognize in the Middle East is King Abdullah II of Jordan.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
172,SANDERS,This small country has welcomed in many refugees.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
173,SANDERS,"And Abdullah said something recently, very important.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
174,SANDERS,"He said, ""Yes, international terrorism is by definition an international issue, but it is primarily an issue of the Muslim nations who are fighting for the soul of Islam. We the Muslims should lead the effort on the ground.""",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
175,SANDERS,And I believe he is absolutely right.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
176,MUIR,"Senator, thank you.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
177,RADDATZ,"Secretary Clinton, in the wake of the San Bernardino attack, you all emphasized gun control.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
178,RADDATZ,"But our latest poll shows that more Americans believe arming people, not stricter gun laws, is the best defense against terrorism.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv

731,CLINTON,"Well, I've been talking to a lot of these families, and this is such an outrage, both because it's bad for our economy, we're a 70 percent consumption economy, people need to feel optimistic and confident, they need to believe their hard work is going to be rewarded, and it's bad for our democracy.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv

770,CLINTON,I want to do more to help incentivize and create more small businesses.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
771,CLINTON,"So if -- if people who are in the private sector know what I stand for, it's what I fought for as a senator, it's what I will do as president, and they want to be part of once again building our economy so it works for everybody, more power to them, because they are the kind of business leaders who understand that if we don't get the American economy moving and growing, we're not going to recognize our country and we're not going to give our kids the same opportunities that we had.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv

780,SANDERS,The CEOs of large multinationals may like Hillary.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv

783,SANDERS,"And the reason for that is we've got to deal with the elephant in the room, which is the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
784,SANDERS,"When you have six financial institutions in this country that issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages, when three out of four of them are larger today than when we bailed them out because they are too big to fail, we've got to re- establish Glass-Steagall, we have got to break the large financial institutions up.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv

790,SANDERS,"And let me be clear: While there are some great corporations creating jobs and trying to do the right thing, in my view -- and I say this very seriously -- the greed of the billionaire class, the greed of Wall Street is destroying this economy and is destroying the lives of millions of Americans.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv

800,O'MALLEY,But there is a better way forward than either of those offered by my two opponents here on this stage.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
801,O'MALLEY,"We're not going to fix what ails our economy, we're not going to make wages go up for everyone by either trying to replace American capitalism with socialism -- which, by the way, the rest of the world is moving away from -- nor will we fix it by submitting to sort of Wall Street-directed crony capitalism.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv

804,O'MALLEY,I believe that the way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
805,O'MALLEY,There's mergers that are happening in every aspect of our country that is bad for competition and it's bad for -- for upward mobility of wages.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv

807,O'MALLEY,"And that's why today you still cannot support, as I do, breaking up the big banks and making sure that we pass a modern-day Glass- Steagall, like we had in late 1999, before it was repealed and led to the crash, where so many millions of families lost their jobs and their homes.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv

831,CLINTON,"So, you know, again, the difference between us and the Republicans is night and day.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv

1137,SYSTEM,(APPLAUSE),0,20151219_3_dem.tsv

1163,SANDERS,What do we do?,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
1164,SANDERS,"Well, for a start, this may seem like a radical idea, but I think we have got to tell the medical profession and doctors who are prescribing opiates and the pharmaceutical industry that they have got to start getting their act together, we cannot have this huge number of opiates out there throughout this country, where young people are taking them, getting hooked, and then going to heroin.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
1165,SANDERS,"Second of all, and the reason I believe in a health care for all program, we need to understand that addiction is a disease, not a criminal activity.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv

1183,CLINTON,"There are too many opioids being prescribed, and that leads directly now to heroin addiction.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv

1193,O'MALLEY,"But together, every single year, I expanded drug treatment funding within our city and then I expanded it in our state, and we were saving lives every single year doing the things that work, intervening earlier, understanding the continuum of care that's required until we got hit like every other state in the state -- in the United States, especially in New Hampshire and in the northeast with this opioid addiction, the over-prescribing.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
1194,O'MALLEY,"I agree, we need better -- we need to rein in the over- prescribing, but I have put forward on my -- in my plan a $12 billion federal investment.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv

1215,CLINTON,"The United States was asked to support the Europeans and the Arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, I recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of Gadhafi.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv

1228,RADDATZ,How much responsibility do you bear for the chaos that followed those elections?,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv

1232,CLINTON,"You know, we can't -- if we're not going to send American troops, which there was never any idea of doing that, then to try to send trainers, to try to send experts, is something we offered, Europeans offered, the U.N. offered, and there wasn't a lot of responsiveness at first.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
1233,CLINTON,"I think a lot of the Libyans who had been forced out of their country by Gadhafi who came back to try to be part of a new government, believed they knew what to do and it turned out that they were no match for some of the militaristic forces inside that country.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv

1237,CLINTON,"Well, there's always a retrospective to say what mistakes were made.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
1238,CLINTON,But I know that we offered a lot of help and I know it was difficult for the Libyans to accept help.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
1239,CLINTON,What we could have done if they had said yes would have been a lot more than what we were able to have done.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv

1244,SANDERS,There are no simple solutions.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
1245,SANDERS,"But where we have a disagreement is that I think if you look at the history of regime changes, you go back to Mossaddegh (ph) in Iran, you go back to Salvador Allende who we overthrew in Chile, you go back to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq, you go back to where we are today in Syria with a dictator named Assad.",0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
1246,SANDERS,The truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like America to overthrow a dictator but it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
1247,SANDERS,So I think secretary Clinton and I have a fundamental disagreement.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv
1248,SANDERS,I'm not quite the fan of regime change that I believe she is.,0,20151219_3_dem.tsv

1130,CHRISTIE,I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it.,0,20160129_7_gop.tsv

1187,PAUL,I have said that we could leave it to the states but I've also introduced a federal solution as well.,0,20160129_7_gop.tsv
1188,PAUL,So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.,0,20160129_7_gop.tsv

170,DINAN,"Senator Rubio in late 2014, Disney laid off 250 tech workers in Orlando, replacing many of them with foreign workers.",0,20160311_12_gop.tsv
171,DINAN,Some of the Americans even had to train their own replacements.,0,20160311_12_gop.tsv
172,DINAN,You support increasing the H-1B visa program that made it possible to bring in these foreign workers.,0,20160311_12_gop.tsv
173,DINAN,Doesn't this program take jobs away from Americans?,0,20160311_12_gop.tsv
174,RUBIO,If it's being abused the way Disney did.,0,20160311_12_gop.tsv
175,RUBIO,"Understand that program, it is illegal now under that program to use it to replace American workers.",0,20160311_12_gop.tsv
176,RUBIO,"Under that program, you have to prove not only that you're not replacing Americans, but that you've tried to hire Americans.",0,20160311_12_gop.tsv
177,RUBIO,"And if a company is caught abusing that process, they should never be allowed to use it again.",0,20160311_12_gop.tsv
178,RUBIO,The second problem with the current structure of the program that people perhaps don't understand is a lot of these companies are not directly hiring employees from abroad.,0,20160311_12_gop.tsv
179,RUBIO,"They are hiring a consulting company like Tata, for example, out of India.",0,20160311_12_gop.tsv

182,RUBIO,You hire - Disney or some other company hires this company.,0,20160311_12_gop.tsv
183,RUBIO,What they're basically doing is they are insourcing and outsourcing.,0,20160311_12_gop.tsv
184,RUBIO,"They are bringing in workers from abroad that are not direct employees of a Disney or someone else, they're employees of this consulting business.",0,20160311_12_gop.tsv

186,RUBIO,"It is illegal now, it is a violation of the law now to use that program to replace Americans.",0,20160311_12_gop.tsv

193,RUBIO,"Well first, I think - well, I'd be open to it if it takes a pause.",0,20160311_12_gop.tsv
194,RUBIO,But I don't think it takes a pause to enforce the law.,0,20160311_12_gop.tsv
195,RUBIO,What they are doing is they are in fact using that program to replace an American.,0,20160311_12_gop.tsv

198,RUBIO,They are outsourcing the entire tech division to a consulting company.,0,20160311_12_gop.tsv
199,RUBIO,They are making the argument that we didn't replace you.,0,20160311_12_gop.tsv
200,RUBIO,We just replaced the whole unit by hiring a company to do it instead.,0,20160311_12_gop.tsv
201,RUBIO,And that company that they're hiring is bringing their workers from abroad.,0,20160311_12_gop.tsv
