Instead, it is assumed that the factual claims are generally true and supported by evidence, but the exact extent and details may vary."

It is a matter of public record that many politicians have opposed such reforms in the past. However, the statement is not specific about the number of politicians or the time frame, which limits the ability to fact-check it fully. Therefore, the score is not 100 but rather 80."
17131,0,80.0,"Real interest rates -- the real cost of interest -- will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that we're moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession.","This sentence contains multiple factual claims:'real interest rates -- the real cost of interest' and'many economists are predicting that we're moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession'. Both claims can be fact-checked using publicly available information, such as economic reports and expert opinions. However, the sentence does not provide specific numbers or sources, which could increase the score if included."
15016,0,80.0,"When I was campaigning in 1976, everywhere I went, the mayors and local officials were in despair about the rapidly deteriorating central cities of our nation.","This statement contains a factual claim about the state of central cities during the 1976 campaign. However, it is not clear who 'everywhere I went' refers to, which limits the scope of fact-checking. Additionally, the statement does not provide specific numbers or statistics, which could strengthen its factual basis. Therefore, the score is set at 80, indicating a moderately check-worthy claim."
20717,0,80.0,"When I was in the United States Senate I worked with former President Bush, your father.","This statement contains a factual claim that the speaker (presumably a senator) worked with former President Bush. The claim is salient as it involves a former president and a current senator. However, the statement does not provide enough context to determine which specific Bush administration the speaker is referring to (George H.W. Bush or George W. Bush), or the time frame of their collaboration. This lack of specificity reduces the check-worthiness score."
5565,0,100.0,"In other words, we're going to take Joe's money, give it to Senator Obama, and let him spread the wealth around.",This sentence contains a clear factual claim that money is being transferred from one person (Joe) to another person (Senator Obama).

This claim is salient to the general public as it touches on the impact of safety concerns on children's activities.

17689,0,80.0,"Now, we need a tight budget, but there's no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and they're hurting.","The sentence contains a claim that the administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life and are hurting. This claim can be fact-checked by looking at specific policies and their impact on vulnerable populations. However, the sentence is not very specific about which policies or populations are being referred to, so the fact-checking process may require additional research to determine the exact claims to be fact-checked."
32886,0,80.0,We have a very divided nation.,"This statement is factual and salient to the general public as it reflects a common perception about the current state of the United States. While it is subjective in nature, it is based on observable facts and can be supported by various data and statistics, such as political polls, social media sentiment analysis, and news articles. For example, a 2021 Pew Research Center survey found that 75% of Americans believe the country is more divided than it was five years ago. Therefore, while the statement is not a definitive fact, it is based on a widely held belief and can be fact-checked using publicly available information."
18237,0,80.0,"And so, the answer to your question is: When our general is on the ground and Ambassador Negroponte tells me that Iraq is ready to defend herself from these terrorists, that elections will have been held by then, that their stability and that they're on their way to, you know, a nation that's free; that's when.","This sentence contains several factual claims: the readiness of Iraq to defend itself, the holding of elections, and the progress towards a free nation. These claims can be fact-checked using publicly available information, such as news articles and reports from international organizations. However, the sentence also includes subjective elements, such as the assessment of the stability of Iraq and the characterization of the Iraqi government as 'on their way' to a free nation. These elements make it difficult to assign a definitive fact-checking score without additional context."
1430,0,100.0,And inflation hits everybody: those who are working and those who are on welfare.,This sentence contains a factual claim that inflation affects both employed and unemployed individuals. It is a widely known economic concept and is relevant to the general public.

It is salient to the general public as it relates to an important government program and economic concept. However, the sentence does not provide a specific numerical value for inflation or Social Security payments, which would make the fact-checking process more straightforward.

This is a significant issue that affects many families in the US and is of public interest.

These claims can be fact-checked using publicly available data and economic indicators such as GDP growth rate, unemployment rate, and tax revenue.

Therefore, the score is not 100, but rather 80, which reflects the degree of fact-checkability of the statement."

The claims about the size of government, industry, and labor unions can be verified through statistics from government reports and economic indicators. The claim about children being victims of mass education can be checked by looking at educational attainment rates and graduation rates. However, the sentence is not entirely check-worthy as it also contains subjective language ('victims') and a vague term ('mass education'). Therefore, the score is not 100 but rather 80."
2890,0,80.0,"I've served as the Governor of Georgia and have traveled extensively in foreign countries and South America, Central America, Europe, the Middle East and in Japan.","This sentence contains factual claims about the speaker's past experiences, which are salient to the public.

4145,0,80.0,The Iranians have met with Ambassador Crocker in Baghdad.,"This statement is checkworthy because it contains a factual claim about a diplomatic meeting between Iranians and a U.S. Ambassador, which is a matter of public interest.

The claim is specific enough to be checkable, as it mentions a particular church being located just outside of Washington, DC. However, the score is not 100 because the sentence does not provide enough information to definitively verify the existence or identity of the church in question. To fact-check this claim, one would need to find publicly available information about black churches located outside of Washington, DC and compare the description to the one given in the sentence."

However, the sentence also includes the conditional statement 'they can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and me, who said we're not going to take any options off the table.' While this statement may be true, it is subjective and does not add to the factual content of the claim. Therefore, the score is not 100 as some of the sentence is not fact-checkable."
