The claim is salient to the general public as it involves a president's actions and discrimination against a religious group. However, the exact identity of the president is not mentioned, so some research would be required to fact-check the claim fully. Therefore, the score is not 100 as some additional fact-checking is needed."
19700,1,30.0,"And what we've done during the Bush administration, the Kurds were at the State Department, negotiating, trying to work their differences out.","This sentence mentions the Bush administration and the Kurds negotiating, but it does not contain any specific factual claims that can be easily checked using publicly available information. The focus is more on the actions taken during the Bush administration and the negotiation process, which are subjective and opinion-centered."
12600,1,20.0,"Do you know we don't have a single program sponsored by our government to Cuba - to tell them our story, to tell them that we are their friends, that we want them to be free again?","This sentence contains subjective claims and opinions, and does not contain any clear factual claims that can be checked using publicly available information."

32496,1,60.0,"And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world.","This statement contains a factual claim about taxes being high in the world. However, without specific numbers or a reliable source, it is difficult to determine the exact position of the US taxes in the global ranking. Therefore, the score is set to 60, indicating a moderately check-worthy statement."
24266,1,95.0,"We have a four trillion dollar debt, and only in America would you finance seventy percent of it five years or less.","This sentence contains two factual claims: 1) We have a four trillion dollar debt, and 2) only in America would you finance seventy percent of it five years or less. The first claim can be fact-checked using publicly available information from sources such as the US Treasury Department or the Federal Reserve. The second claim can be fact-checked by comparing the average maturity of US government debt to that of other countries. Both claims are salient to the general public and therefore the sentence is highly check-worthy."
15712,1,80.0,We're in the serious stages of negotiation with the Soviet Union on the strategic arms control talks.,"This statement is checkworthy because it contains a factual claim about ongoing negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union. The strategic arms control talks were a significant geopolitical event, and the public would be interested in knowing about their progress. However, the score is not 100 because the specific details of the negotiations, such as the terms being discussed, are not mentioned and would require additional fact-checking."

However, it also includes the subjective claim that 'both parties' made this mistake, which may require additional context or evidence to fact-check accurately. Therefore, the score is not 100, but rather 80, to account for the uncertainty surrounding the 'both parties' claim."
1789,1,50.0,And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions.,"This sentence contains a claim about a person's intention to pay for something by closing loopholes and deductions. However, it is not clear who the person is or which specific loopholes and deductions are being referred to. Without more context or identifiable facts, it would be difficult to fact-check this claim with publicly available information. Therefore, it is given a medium check-worthiness score of 50."
32725,1,50.0,"So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.","This sentence contains a claim about an upcoming military attack on Mosul, but the exact timing is uncertain (three or four weeks). While the claim itself is factual, the lack of a specific date makes it difficult to fact-check using publicly available information. Therefore, the check-worthiness score is moderate."
27509,1,60.0,"And then the president began what I have called an apology tour, of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America.","This sentence contains a claim about the president's actions during a tour in the Middle East. However, it is not clear which president is being referred to, and the term 'apology tour' is a subjective interpretation of the president's actions. To fact-check this claim, we would need to identify which president is being referred to and determine if they indeed went on an 'apology tour' in the Middle East. This would require additional context or information beyond the given sentence."
2336,1,50.0,That's one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank.,"This sentence implies a factual claim about the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank, but it is not clear what specific consequence is being referred to. To determine the factual accuracy of this claim, more context or information would be needed. Therefore, the check-worthiness score is medium (50)."
12993,1,80.0,We find four times as many projects undertaken and completed in this Administration than in the previous one.,"This statement contains a factual claim about the number of projects undertaken and completed in two different administrations. However, without specific numbers, it is difficult to determine the exact score. A fact-check would involve looking up the number of projects in each administration from a reliable source."
17464,1,80.0,It was only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that the Federal Government intervened in what had always been a State policy.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about the Supreme Court's decision and the Federal Government's intervention. However, it does not provide enough information to definitively fact-check the claim, as the specifics of the case and the timing of the intervention are not mentioned. Therefore, the score is not 100, but rather 80, which indicates a moderately check-worthy statement."
11247,1,50.0,That's what we've been doing over the last eight years and that has actually made us more safe.,"This statement contains a claim about making the country safer over the last eight years, which is factual. However, without additional context or specific data, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of this claim and its salience to the general public. Therefore, I assign it a medium check-worthiness score of 50."
2874,1,100.0,"Immediately before the Kansas City convention, he added back another one point eight billion dollars in the defense budget.",This sentence contains a factual claim about a specific amount of money being added to the defense budget at a particular time. This information can be fact-checked using publicly available records of government budgets.
26076,1,100.0,We reduced the welfare rolls by 2 million already.,This statement is factual and salient to the general public as it mentions a specific number (2 million) of people who have been removed from welfare rolls.

21706,1,80.0,In Houston there's been a 15- percent drop in the crime rate in the last year because of the work the mayor did there in increasing the police force.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about a percentage drop in crime rate in Houston in the last year. However, it also includes an opinionated statement about the cause of the drop, which is the mayor's work in increasing the police force. To fact-check this claim, we would need to find publicly available data on Houston's crime rate for the last year and compare it to previous years. We would also need to find information on the mayor's actions regarding increasing the police force. While we can fact-check the crime rate claim, the cause attribution claim would require additional research and potentially expert analysis, which may not be publicly available."
25315,1,0.0,"Georgie Anne, we, believe me, supported the Simpson-Mazzoli bill strongly -- and the bill that came out of the Senate.",This sentence contains no factual claims that can be checked using publicly available information.

However, the exact cost figures are not provided, making it difficult to determine the exact check-worthiness score. A score of 50 is given as a rough estimate based on the presence of factual claims."

These claims can be fact-checked using publicly available information. However, the sentence does not specify the location or the country of this system, which might limit the scope of fact-checking. Therefore, the score is not 100 but 80."
20122,1,50.0,There are actually more people in government except for people in defense related jobs.,"This statement is somewhat factual but lacks specificity and quantifiable data. It is a claim about the number of people in government, but it does not specify which government or which jobs are included in the definition of 'defense related'. Without this information, it is difficult to fact-check the statement definitively."
28296,1,80.0,"It's ironic that there are now -- there is now a smaller percentage of the voters made up of parents with children than ever in American history because of the aging of our population, but at the same time we've got the largest generation of students in public schools ever.","This sentence contains two factual claims: 1) there is now a smaller percentage of voters who are parents with children than ever before in American history, and 2) there is the largest generation of students in public schools ever. These claims can be fact-checked using publicly available data from sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center for Education Statistics."
7721,1,80.0,"When he selected his vice presidential running mate, he selected a man who had voted against most of these proposals and who opposes them at the present time.","This sentence contains a factual claim about a specific action taken by a person (selecting a vice presidential running mate) and the fact that the selected person had opposed certain proposals in the past. However, it does not provide specific details about which proposals were in question or the number of times the person had opposed them. Therefore, the score is not 100 as more information would be needed to fully fact-check the claim."

19702,1,0.0,"We're even shipping 3,000 Kurds to Guam.","This sentence is non check-worthy as it contains a statement about shipping 3,000 Kurds to Guam, which is an opinion-centered statement and not factual. There is no publicly available information to fact-check this claim."
17550,1,0.0,"In my opinion, as we deal with this deficit, people from about $70,000 a year on down have to be dealt with very, very carefully, because they are the ones who didn't get any relief the first time around.","This sentence is non check-worthy as it contains an opinion statement 'have to be dealt with very, very carefully' and a subjective statement 'people from about $70,000 a year on down'."
2316,1,80.0,"You had loan officers were -- that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn't have been given, because the folks didn't qualify.","This sentence implies that loan officers were issuing mortgages to people who did not qualify for them. This is a factual claim that could be checked using data on mortgage approvals and applicant qualifications. However, it is not clear who the loan officers were or which specific loans and mortgages are being referred to, which limits the scope of the fact-checking inquiry. Therefore, the score is not 100, but rather 80, reflecting the partial check-worthiness of the statement."
32009,1,80.0,And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about Donald's behavior towards certain individuals based on their religion. However, it does not provide specific details about who these individuals are or when exactly this behavior occurred.

14867,1,50.0,"I would call to your attention that we were in a war that wound down during those eight years, which of course made a change in military spending because of turning from war to peace.","This sentence mentions a historical fact (the winding down of a war during a specific time period), but it does not provide enough specific information to fact-check effectively. A fact-checker would need to know which war is being referred to and when exactly it ended to verify the claim. Therefore, the sentence receives a medium check-worthiness score."

However, it is not clear if the exact quotes or sources are publicly available, which may impact the ability to fact-check the claim definitively. Additionally, the sentence implies that the same Government made these statements twice, but it does not specify which Government is being referred to, which could also impact the ability to fact-check the claim. Therefore, the score is set to 80, indicating a moderately check-worthy claim."
13427,1,85.0,"And the Vice President cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers' salaries in the Senate, which prevented that being added.","This sentence contains a factual claim about the Vice President casting a deciding vote against federal aid for teachers' salaries in the Senate. This information can be fact-checked using publicly available records of Senate votes.

These claims can be fact-checked using publicly available information, such as historical economic data and government budget reports.

Therefore, the score is set at 80 to reflect the presence of factual claims but also the presence of assumptions and projections."
2820,1,50.0,"A few months later, he said he wanted to cut the defense budget by eight or nine billion dollars.","This sentence contains a claim about a specific amount of money that 'he' (presumably a political figure) wants to cut from the defense budget. However, without further context or a specific source, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of this claim. Additionally, the sentence does not provide enough information to fact-check the claim definitively. Therefore, I assign a score of 50 to this sentence."
34250,1,0.0,"He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful.","This sentence contains a claim about aligning 'He' with Iran and making Iran'very powerful'. However, it lacks specificity and quantifiability, making it difficult to fact-check using publicly available information.

10863,1,70.0,"Nuclear power is safe, and it's clean, and it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs.","This sentence contains three claims: 1) Nuclear power is safe, 2) Nuclear power is clean, and 3) Nuclear power creates hundreds of thousands of jobs. While all three claims can be fact-checked, the level of factual detail and publicly available information for each claim varies. The claim 'Nuclear power is safe' can be fact-checked using data on nuclear accidents and radiation exposure. The claim 'Nuclear power is clean' can be fact-checked by examining the environmental impact of nuclear power plants, including their carbon emissions and water usage. The claim 'Nuclear power creates hundreds of thousands of jobs' can be fact-checked by looking at employment data from the nuclear power industry. However, the level of detail and specificity required to fact-check each claim may make this a time-consuming and complex task. Therefore, I assign a score of 70 to this sentence, indicating that it is checkworthy but may require significant effort to fact-check thoroughly."

16829,1,80.0,"This permits a company to create uh - a dummy corporation, to export their products, and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them.","This sentence contains a claim about a company's tax evasion practices, which is factual and salient to the general public.

However, it is important to note that the exact amount of the imbalance and the effectiveness of the proposed solution are not specified, leaving some room for interpretation and potential inaccuracies.

It is salient to the general public as it relates to a controversial issue and a former U.S. President. However, it would require some effort to fact-check as it would require accessing primary sources such as legislative records or news articles reporting on the vote in question. Therefore, the score is not 100 but rather 85, indicating a high level of check-worthiness."
3116,1,30.0,"Just recently, President Rabin said that our relations were never better.","This statement is factual but it is not checkworthy because it is a subjective assessment of the current state of relations between two entities, which is not publicly verifiable.

28462,1,50.0,Right now our military is the strongest in the entire history of the world.,"This statement is subjective and opinion-centered, as it relies on the qualifier'strongest in the entire history of the world'. While it is possible to fact-check the military strength of various countries, determining which one is the strongest at any given point in history is a complex task that goes beyond the scope of a fact-checking assistant. Additionally, military strength can be measured in various ways, such as numbers of troops, weapons, or technological capabilities, and different metrics may yield different results. Therefore, it is not feasible to assign a definitive factual value to this claim."

However, it also includes an opinionated statement about the insufficiency of these sanctions.

16609,1,80.0,"We have twenty different agencies in the federal government responsible for the production, the regulation, the uh - information about energy, the conservation of energy, spread all over government.","This sentence contains a factual claim about the number of federal agencies responsible for energy production, regulation, and information. However, it is not clear if the number is exact or an approximation, and the sentence mentions'spread all over government' which could include more or fewer agencies than mentioned. Therefore, the score is not 100 but rather an estimate based on the given information."
8202,1,100.0,We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven years.,This sentence contains two factual claims: the growth rates of GNP during the two administrations.

However, it is not clear from the sentence alone whether the boycott specifically targets American businesses with Jewish ownership or involvement.

Therefore, the score is not 100, as more information would be needed to fully fact-check the claim."
14710,1,0.0,It's been tried for 12 years and it's failed.,This sentence is non check-worthy as it only contains a statement about the duration of an event (12 years) and a subjective statement ('it's failed'). There is no factual claim that can be verified using publicly available information.

These claims can be fact-checked using publicly available information.
2018,1,30.0,"Well, the economy is still growing slow.","This sentence contains a factual claim about the economy growing slowly, but it is not a clear and definitive statement. The term'still' implies that this has been a ongoing trend, but it does not provide any specific numbers or time frame to fact-check. Additionally, the claim is subjective as it is based on the speaker's interpretation of'slow' growth. Therefore, the claim is only somewhat check-worthy."
19658,1,50.0,"And even when it finally got near passage, Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days, because he wasn't satisfied with one provision.","This sentence mentions a factual claim about Senator Kennedy holding up a bill for 100 days. However, it does not provide enough context or information to definitively fact-check this claim. It is also unclear which bill is being referred to. Therefore, a score of 50 is given, indicating that this sentence is somewhat check-worthy."
8806,1,0.0,That meant immediately 46% of your people that were signing up had no reason for signing up.,This sentence contains a subjective statement 'had no reason for signing up' which cannot be fact-checked using publicly available information.

13613,1,95.0,The rich are paying a bigger percent of the total tax burden.,This statement is factual and salient to the general public as it relates to a significant economic issue. The percentage of taxes paid by different income groups is a commonly discussed topic in politics and economics.

This information is salient to the general public as it pertains to the military's readiness and ability to respond to potential threats. The specific numbers (six out of 10, two out of three) add to the factual nature of the claim and increase the score."
21359,1,80.0,Because the deficit now has been building up for 12 years.,"This statement contains a factual claim about the length of time that the US federal budget deficit has been increasing, which is a matter of public record and can be fact-checked using data from the US Treasury or the Congressional Budget Office."

However, it does not provide any specific numbers or statistics, and the sentence does not directly impact the general public in a significant way. Therefore, the check-worthiness score is moderate."
17655,1,95.0,Half -- one out of two of the full-time college students in the United States are receiving some form of Federal aid.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about the percentage of full-time college students in the US receiving Federal aid. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, 44 million students were enrolled in degree-granting postsecondary institutions in 2019-2020, and about 15 million of those students received Federal student aid. Therefore, approximately 33% of full-time college students in the US received Federal aid. However, the sentence states 'Half -- one out of two' which is a rounding error from the actual percentage. Thus, I assign a score of 95 instead of 100."
2591,1,0.0,The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty.,"This sentence contains a factual claim, but it is not checkworthy because it is not salient to the general public. The statistic '1 out of 6 people in poverty' is specific to the United States and may change over time. Additionally, it is not a widely known fact, and its significance may not be immediately clear to the general public. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a check-worthy claim."
16677,1,80.0,We estimate that those programs would add a hundred billion dollars minimum and probably two hundred billion dollars - uhh maximum each year to the federal budget.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about the estimated cost of certain programs to the federal budget.

Additionally, the sentence also includes subjective statements such as 'I couldn't take that,' which further reduces its check-worthiness score."
19372,1,80.0,"What about drugs that have increased, doubled in the last 44 months?","This sentence contains a factual claim about an increase or doubling of drugs in the last 44 months. However, the specific drugs and the exact amount of increase or doubling are not mentioned, making it a somewhat vague claim. To fact-check this claim, we would need to identify which drugs are being referred to and find reliable sources that provide data on their price increases or quantities over the last 44 months. Therefore, the score is set to 80, indicating a moderately check-worthy claim."
6595,1,100.0,He voted to increase taxes 98 times.,"This statement is checkworthy as it is a factual claim about a specific number of actions taken by an individual, which can be verified through publicly available records."

29832,1,80.0,But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City.,This statement is checkworthy because it contains a factual claim about the impact of stop-and-frisk on the safety of New York City.

26431,1,80.0,More than half of these 10 and a half million new jobs are in higher wage areas and we'll have more manufacturing and sales around the world.,"The sentence contains the claim that'more than half' of 10 and a half million new jobs are in higher wage areas. This is a factual claim that can be checked using publicly available data on wage levels and job growth in different areas. The sentence also mentions the creation of more manufacturing and sales around the world, which is also a factual claim that can be checked using data on international trade and manufacturing output. However, the sentence does not provide a specific source for this information, so the score is not 100."
11704,1,30.0,But one of the problems we have in the military is we're in a lot of places around the world.,"This sentence mentions a factual situation in the military, but it is not a specific claim that can be fact-checked using publicly available information.

7677,1,80.0,Sixty to seventy percent of our colored children do not finish high school.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about the percentage of colored children who do not finish high school. However, the specific percentage given (sixty to seventy) requires further fact-checking to determine its accuracy. Additionally, the term 'colored children' is vague and potentially outdated, so it would be important to clarify the demographic being referred to in order to properly fact-check the claim."
14339,1,50.0,-- and Glaspie's papers have been presented to the US Senate.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about the presentation of papers to the US Senate, but it is not clear who Glaspie is or what the papers contain. Without more context or information, it would be difficult to fact-check this claim definitively using publicly available information."

25508,1,85.0,And they installed a Marxist-Leninist totalitarian government.,"This statement contains a factual claim about the type of government that was installed, which is relevant to the general public. However, it is important to note that determining whether a government is Marxist-Leninist requires some level of interpretation and analysis, which may introduce some subjectivity. Additionally, the statement does not provide any specific information about where or when this government was installed, which could limit the availability of publicly available information for fact-checking. Therefore, the score is not perfect, but it is still considered check-worthy."

The second claim, '16,500-plus ICE last week', is a factual claim, but it is not salient to the general public and it is not publicly available information. The third claim, 'endorsed me', is an opinion-centered statement and is not factual or salient to the general public."
25526,1,60.0,"What happens in South Africa, where, for example, the Nobel Prize winner, 2 days ago, said this administration is seen as working with the oppressive government of South Africa.","This sentence contains a claim about a Nobel Prize winner making a statement about the South African government being oppressive. While this claim is factual, it is not clear who the Nobel Prize winner is or what they specifically said, making it difficult to fact-check without additional information. Therefore, the score is relatively low."

The claim can be fact-checked using publicly available data from sources such as the Congressional Research Service, the Federal Reserve Economic Data, or the Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, the sentence does not provide a specific time frame or cite a source for the data, which may require additional research to determine the exact figures and years to which the sentence refers.

26963,1,80.0,"Governor Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that Al Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not Al Qaida; you said Russia, in the 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years.","This sentence contains a factual claim about Governor Romney's statement about the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, which can be fact-checked using publicly available information. However, it also includes an opinionated statement about the significance of Romney's mistake and a reference to a past event (the Cold War), which reduces the score slightly."
30219,1,85.0,"And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.","This sentence contains a factual claim about a diplomatic agreement between Iran and the United States, which is a significant event in international relations. The claim can be fact-checked using publicly available information, such as news articles and official statements from the involved parties. However, it is important to note that the sentence also includes the subjective claim'my successor, John Kerry,' which may require additional context or verification to ensure accuracy. Therefore, the score is not a perfect 100, but still relatively high due to the objective and salient nature of the primary claim."

7780,1,60.0,"And therefore we passed an authorization - not an aid bill - which was the first time, really, since the Inter-American Bank which was founded a year ago was developed, that we really have looked at the needs of Latin America; that we have associated ourselves with those people.","The sentence mentions the passing of an authorization bill for Latin America, which is a factual claim. However, the claim about it being the first time since the Inter-American Bank was founded that such a bill was passed is not easily verifiable with publicly available information.

The claim can be fact-checked using publicly available information, such as census data or reports from government agencies.

15637,1,80.0,"And you supported legislation this year that's involved tax increases not once, but twice.","This sentence contains a factual claim about the legislative actions taken by the person being referred to. The claim is salient to the public as it relates to tax policy, which is a significant issue. However, the sentence does not provide specific details about the legislation or the amount of the tax increases, which limits the ability to fact-check the claim fully. Therefore, the score is not 100, but rather 80, which reflects the degree of factual information provided in the sentence."
8722,1,30.0,"The fact is, that in today's oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used.","This statement contains a claim about the amount of oil still in oil wells, which is factual.

26039,1,50.0,American seniors have the highest life expectancy in the world.,"This claim is somewhat checkworthy as it touches on a factual matter, but it is not definitively true. According to the World Bank, Japan and Spain have higher life expectancies than the United States. However, it is worth noting that there are various ways to measure life expectancy and different data sources may yield slightly different results. Therefore, it is possible that some data sources could show the United States having the highest life expectancy for seniors, but this would not be the case based on the most commonly cited data."
16545,1,0.0,"Now it seems to me that uh - as we look at the recommendations of the budget committees and our own projections, there isn't going to be any $60 billion dividend.",This sentence does not contain any factual claims that are checkworthy.

261,1,60.0,He introduced or supported legislation back then that suggested that kids of Massachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war.,"This sentence contains a claim about a specific legislative action taken by an individual (He) in the past (back then). However, it does not provide enough information to definitively fact-check the claim, such as the name of the legislation or the war in question. Additionally, the sentence mentions 'kids of Massachusetts' being exempt from going overseas, which may not be a factual statement for all kids in Massachusetts at the time. Therefore, the score is set to 60, indicating a potentially check-worthy claim with some ambiguity."
32705,1,80.0,"Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS.","This statement is checkworthy because it contains a factual claim about the ongoing conflict in Syria between the Syrian government and ISIS. While the specific details of the conflict, such as the exact location and intensity of fighting, may change over time, the fact that Syria is currently engaged in combat with ISIS is a significant and widely reported fact."
21804,1,95.0,"I've had more people talk to me about their health care problems I guess than anything else, all across America -- you know, people who've lost their jobs, lost their businesses, had to give up their jobs because of sick children.","This sentence contains multiple factual claims about people talking about their health care problems across America, people losing jobs, and having to give up jobs due to sick children. These claims are salient to the general public and can be fact-checked using publicly available data on employment and health care statistics."
25749,1,0.0,"They see 900 FBI files, private person, being gathered up by somebody in the Whitehouse.","This sentence contains multiple factual inaccuracies and lacks sufficient context to determine the truth. The number 900 is not specified as the number of FBI files or the number of files being gathered up. It is also unclear who'somebody' is and where in the White House the gathering is taking place. Additionally, the sentence implies that a private person is involved, but no such identification is made. Without more information, it is impossible to fact-check this claim."
25328,1,80.0,"But as long as they have an economy that leaves so many people in dire poverty and unemployment, they are going to seek that employment across our borders.","This sentence contains a factual claim about poverty and unemployment in another country, which is relevant to the general public.

However, it is not clear which bill the speaker is referring to, or the exact aid amounts for each area mentioned. Therefore, the claim cannot be fact-checked definitively with publicly available information, and the score is set to 70 to reflect the presence of a factual claim."
20063,1,0.0,"I'm trying to save your Medicare, just as I rescued Social Security with a bipartisan commission.",This sentence contains subjective and opinion-centered statements. The claim about saving Medicare is not factual or salient to the general public as it is a political statement. The claim about rescuing Social Security with a bipartisan commission is also not fact-checkable as it requires more context and specific information about the commission and its impact on Social Security.

However, it also mentions an attack on Formosa and the Pescadores, which is not explicitly stated to be part of the same event. To fact-check this claim, one would need to determine if there was a general attack on Formosa and the Pescadores around the same time Mr. Nixon made this statement, and if so, whether he intended to defend those islands as well. This level of fact-checking would require additional research beyond what is publicly available in the given sentence."
12741,1,80.0,Let me point out again that his Congress - the Democratic Congress - has cut eighty million dollars off of the Voice of America appropriations.,This statement contains a factual claim about a specific amount of money being cut from the Voice of America appropriations by the Democratic Congress.

440,1,50.0,No other state programs do that.,"This statement is checkworthy because it implies a factual claim about the existence and uniqueness of a certain state program. However, without more context or specific information about which state program is being referred to, it would be difficult to fact-check this claim definitively using publicly available information. Therefore, the check-worthiness score is set at a moderate level (50) to reflect the uncertainty of the claim."
8587,1,80.0,"Our health program - the one that Senator Javits and other Republican Senators, as well as I supported - is one that provides for all people over sixty-five who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it.","This sentence contains a factual claim about a health program that provides health insurance for people over sixty-five.

It only mentions a proposed action (proposing a hydrogen automobile) and the reason for the action (hydrogen-generated). These are subjective and opinion-centered statements.
13660,1,80.0,He vetoed middle class tax relief this year.,"This statement is checkworthy because it contains a factual claim about a specific action taken by a public figure (the president) in a given year (this year). The factual claim can be verified by checking the official records of the president or the legislative body. However, it is important to note that the statement does not provide enough context to determine which middle class tax relief bill was being referred to, and whether it was indeed a relief bill or not. Therefore, the score is not 100, as additional fact-checking would be required to determine the exact nature of the bill in question."
21376,1,100.0,"Governor Clinton's program wants to tax more and spend more -- $150 billion in new taxes, spend another $220.",This sentence contains two clear factual claims: $150 billion in new taxes and $220 billion in new spending.

8010,1,0.0,We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it's attacked.,"This sentence contains a negation and a conditional statement, making it difficult to fact-check objectively using publicly available information.

However, it is not clear who the 'President' being referred to is, and the sentence does not provide enough context to determine the total coal resources in the United States or where they are located. Therefore, the claim cannot be fact-checked with publicly available information and is given a medium check-worthiness score."
26712,1,80.0,"When you have 900 files gathered up by some guy who is a bouncer in a bar and hired a security officer to collect files, in Watergate -- I know a person who went to jail for looking at one file, one FBI file.","This sentence contains several factual claims: 1) There are 900 files gathered by a guy who is a bouncer in a bar, 2) A security officer was hired to collect the files, 3) This all took place during Watergate, and 4) One person went to jail for looking at one FBI file. However, the sentence does not provide enough context or specific information to fact-check these claims fully.

6838,1,50.0,"Well, he didn't include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the federal government some $28 billion a year and costs our society between $60 billion and $100 billion a year.","This sentence mentions a factual claim about the cost of defensive medicine in the US, but it is not clear enough to fact-check without additional context. The range of costs ($60 billion to $100 billion) is also quite large, making it difficult to determine the accuracy of the claim without more information."
27353,1,80.0,"Now, keep in mind that our military spending has gone up every single year that I've been in office.",This statement is checkworthy because it contains a factual claim about military spending during the speaker's tenure in office.

However, it does not provide a specific numerical value or a reliable source for the reduction in military size during the present administration.

However, this claim is not check-worthy as it is an opinion and the outcome depends on the specifics of the package and its implementation. The sentence also contains a conditional statement ('if it's structured properly') which further reduces its check-worthiness."
15463,1,100.0,"We returned $5.7 billion in tax rebates, credits and cuts to our people.","This statement is factual and salient to the general public as it involves a specific monetary amount that was returned to people through various tax rebates, credits, and cuts.

12528,1,30.0,"We ended the Korean War; by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars; and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table.","This sentence contains several claims, but they are all subjective and opinion-based. The first claim, 'We ended the Korean War,' is factual but does not provide enough context or specificity to be check-worthy. The second claim, 'by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars,' is an opinionated statement about the effectiveness of leadership in preventing wars. The third claim, 'and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table,' is another opinionated statement about the success of diplomacy in maintaining national integrity."
2045,1,85.0,We're now spending 42 percent of our economy on government.,This statement is checkworthy because it contains a factual claim about the percentage of the economy that is spent on government.

32818,1,85.0,African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities.,"This statement contains a factual claim about the poverty rate among African Americans in inner cities. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the poverty rate for Black or African American households in 2019 was 25.8 percent, which is close to 45 percent of 55.6 percent (the overall poverty rate for the U.S. population). However, it's important to note that the sentence's specificity might not be entirely accurate, as the poverty rate can vary significantly between different inner cities and urban areas. Therefore, a more precise fact-check would require examining data from specific cities or regions."

The sentence does mention the use of special forces and trainers in Iraq, but this is a trivial factual claim that is not salient to the general public and can be easily verified. Therefore, the score would be 0 with the reasoning that the sentence is non check-worthy."

The claim is salient to the general public as it relates to a public figure's behavior towards another person, and the time frame and personal nature of the attacks add to its newsworthiness. However, the sentence does not provide enough information to definitively identify the individuals involved, so the score is not 100."

These claims can be fact-checked using publicly available information, such as government reports and news articles. However, the sentence does not provide a clear and concise statement of facts, making it somewhat difficult to assign a high check-worthiness score. Additionally, the sentence mentions the Soviet Union, which may require additional context or information to fully understand the factual claims being made.

While both claims are factual, they are not directly checkable with publicly available information. The first claim can be checked by finding primary sources or historical records that confirm Landon's stance on Social Security. The second claim requires access to specific data on the cost of Social Security during Kennedy's presidency and the projected cost of his proposals, which may not be readily available.

Therefore, the score is set to 85, indicating a high level of check-worthiness, but with some degree of uncertainty due to the complexity of the fact-checking process."

However, it is not clear where this information comes from, so it may require some fact-checking to verify. Additionally, the sentence does not provide enough context to determine if this is a significant or representative statistic, so the check-worthiness score is not at its maximum."
13106,1,30,"I will say this: in the event that such an attack occurred and in the event the attack was a prelude to an attack on Formosa - which would be the indication today because the Chinese Communists say over and over again that their objective is not the offshore islands, that they consider them only steppingstones to taking Formosa - in the event that their attack then were a prelude to an attack on Formosa, there isn't any question but that the United States would then again, as in the case of Berlin, honor our treaty obligations and stand by our ally of Formosa.","The sentence contains several conditional statements and mentions the possibility of an attack on Formosa.

The claim is salient to the general public as it touches on the importance of education and research for technological advancements and economic growth. However, the sentence also contains an inaudible part, which makes it difficult to fact-check fully without additional context. Therefore, the score is not 100, but rather 80, reflecting the uncertainty introduced by the inaudible part."

While the claim itself is factual, the sentence does not provide any publicly available information to fact-check the claim.

However, the first claim requires access to specific aid figures for various countries, which may not be readily available or easily verifiable. The second claim is more straightforward to fact-check, as it involves a shift in political alignment, but it would still require some research to confirm.

Therefore, the overall score is 50."
1940,1,50,The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth.,"This statement is opinionated and does not contain any clear factual claims that can be checked using publicly available information. However, it does touch on a common economic debate, so it may be considered somewhat checkworthy depending on the context. For example, if the sentence is part of a larger discussion that includes specific facts or data about tax rates and economic growth, it could potentially be fact-checked. But without such context, the statement as written is not checkworthy."

8665,1,30,"I simply think that when we are confronting a budget deficit this year - and this fiscal year will end in about 10 days, and we are confronted with the possibility of a deficit of $60 billion, perhaps as much as $63 billion - that that simply would be irresponsible.","This sentence expresses the opinion of the speaker that it would be irresponsible to have a budget deficit of $60-$63 billion.

However, it is not clear whether the statement is referring to the entirety of the Arizona law or just a part of it (E-Verify). To fact-check this claim, one would need to find a reliable source that confirms the identity of Trump's top adviser on immigration and whether this person was indeed the one who designed the entirety of the Arizona law or just a part of it. Therefore, the score is not 100 because the claim is not fully check-worthy without additional context."

18655,1,50,"That's the enemy that is now in 60 countries, with stronger recruits.","This sentence contains a claim about the enemy being in 60 countries, but it does not specify which enemy is being referred to. Without this information, it is difficult to fact-check the claim using publicly available information.

The claim can be fact-checked using publicly available information, such as government reports or news articles. However, the exact number of people who will be affected may depend on various factors, such as the implementation of the bill and the demographic makeup of the population. Therefore, the score is not 100, but rather 85, to account for the potential uncertainty surrounding the precise number of people who will be impacted."
19701,1,0,Now we've got all thousands and thousands of refugees.,"This sentence does not contain any factual claims that are checkworthy. It only mentions the presence of 'thousands and thousands' of refugees, which is a trivial factual claim."

Both claims can be fact-checked using publicly available data such as inflation rates, wage growth, and tax rates. However, it's important to note that the sentence does not specify a particular country or region, which may affect the accuracy of the fact-check. Therefore, the score is not 100, but rather 85 to account for the potential ambiguity."
19156,1,0,"If you made 25,000 as the original proposal, you got your Social Security taxes increased.",This sentence is non check-worthy as it only contains a statement about a specific financial transaction and does not provide any factual information that can be verified publicly.

However, the claim is based on the speaker's belief and there is no citation or publicly available data provided to support it. A score of 80 is given because the claim, if true, would be significant and of public interest."
3130,1,50,"In the meantime, there has developed the problem of the Soviet Backfire - their high-performance aircraft which they say is not a long-range aircraft and which some of our people say is a intercontinental aircraft.","This sentence contains a claim about the range of the Soviet Backfire aircraft, which is factual and potentially salient to the general public. However, the claim is not definitively stated and is open to interpretation, which reduces its check-worthiness score.

18128,1,85,Iraq was not even close to the center of the war on terror before the president invaded it.,"This statement contains a factual claim about the geographical location of the Iraq war in relation to the broader War on Terror. While the exact center of the War on Terror is subjective, it is widely accepted that Iraq was not a central front in the conflict prior to the US invasion in 2003.

These claims can be fact-checked using publicly available data from sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Census Bureau, and the U.S. Department of Commerce. However, the sentence does not provide enough context to determine which state is being referred to, so additional information would be needed to complete the fact-checking process."

The existence and scope of the small business exemption can be fact-checked, but determining whether this was a significant factor in Mr. Bush's decision to veto the bill is beyond the scope of fact-checking."
8208,1,85,We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about the difference in price increase rates between two specific administrations. The claim can be fact-checked using historical data on inflation rates or consumer price indices. However, the sentence does not provide a specific numerical value for the price increase in each administration, so the fact-checking process would require additional research to determine the exact figures. Therefore, the score is not 100, but rather 85, reflecting the level of effort required to fact-check the claim."
2909,1,60,"In many instances we've made agreements, like in Vietnam, uh - that have uh - been revealed later on to our uh - embarrassment.","This sentence contains a claim about past agreements in Vietnam that have caused embarrassment to the US. However, the specifics of these agreements and their impact on embarrassment are not clearly stated, making it difficult to fact-check with publicly available information.

Therefore, the score is set at 50, indicating a moderate level of checkworthiness."
16711,1,0,Now we've increased that amount 25 percent.,"This sentence does not contain any factual claims that are checkworthy. It only mentions an increase of an amount without specifying what that amount is or by how much it was increased previously. Therefore, it is non-checkworthy."

While these claims may be factual, they are not directly checkable with publicly available information as the sentence does not provide enough context or specific details about the 'negotiation' or the 'walk in the woods' event. Therefore, it is given a medium check-worthiness score of 50."

This information can be fact-checked using publicly available data from the Senator's campaign website or news articles.

27252,1,80,Trade grows about 12 percent year.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about the percentage growth rate of trade in a given year.

It is salient to the general public as it relates to international relations and nuclear weapons, which are significant topics.

However, it is not clear which specific states are being referred to beyond New England, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.

The sentence mentions eliminating ten million taxpayers, putting a heavier tax burden on those in higher tax brackets, and other actions taken.

16461,1,50,I notice particularly that he didn't endorse the Humphrey-Hawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform.,"This statement is checkworthy because it mentions a specific legislative bill (Humphrey-Hawkins) and the fact that a particular individual (he) did not endorse it. However, the statement is not very clear about who 'he' is and in what context the statement was made. This lack of context makes it difficult to fact-check the statement definitively, which reduces its check-worthiness score."

The first claim is factual but it requires additional information to determine its saliency to the general public.

However, it would require some effort to fact-check this claim as it would involve finding the specific requests and their timeline.

Therefore, I assign a score of 80 to this sentence."
12259,1,80,"The book you mentioned that Vice President Gore wrote, he also called for taxing -- big energy taxes in order to clean up the environment.","This sentence contains a factual claim about Vice President Gore's position on energy taxes for environmental purposes.

Therefore, while the statement is checkworthy, the score is reduced due to the lack of a definitive source and potential for ambiguity."

To fact-check the claim about the economic crisis, one could look up data on economic indicators such as GDP growth, unemployment rates, and inflation during the Great Depression and the last eight years. To fact-check the opinions about the policies and Washington's unwillingness, one would need more specific information and context, which may not be publicly available."

However, it is not clear where this number comes from and whether it is up-to-date. Therefore, the claim needs to be fact-checked using a reliable source to determine its accuracy. Additionally, the sentence also contains an opinionated statement about the vice president, which does not contribute to the check-worthiness score."

Therefore, while the claim is factual in nature, it is not fully check-worthy without additional context."

However, the sentence also includes subjective statements and opinions, such as the speaker's confusion about the line item veto. The factual claims are salient to the general public as they relate to significant political events, but the subjective statements and opinions reduce the overall check-worthiness score."
33662,1,10,"I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less.",This statement is factual but it is not checkworthy because it is a repetition of a campaign promise and does not provide new or significant factual information to the general public.

However, it is important to note that the number of Libyans who marched and expressed friendship towards America after the events in Benghazi is not an easily verifiable fact.

7617,1,30,"And I said that I felt that rather than tell the lie which we told, rather than indicate that the flights would continue - in fact, I believe Mr. Nixon himself said on May fifteenth that the flights would continue even though Mr. Herter testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that they had been canceled as of May twelfth - that it would have been far better that if we had expressed regrets, if that would have saved the summit, and if the summit is useful - and I believe it is.","The sentence contains several factual claims, but they are not directly checkable with publicly available information. The claims about what Nixon and Herter said are specific to their testimonies, which would require access to the full transcripts to fact-check.

The claim is factual and relevant to the general public, as Social Security is a significant public policy issue.

However, it is not clear from the sentence how much the increase is, or over what time period it occurs. Additionally, the sentence mentions that there may have been one or two years where the tax was not applied, but it does not provide any information about how frequently this occurs or why it happened. Without more context or specific information, it would be difficult to fact-check this claim with publicly available information."
13641,1,50,My plan balances the budget within 6 years.,"This statement is checkworthy because it contains a factual claim about balancing the budget within a specific time frame. However, the claim lacks sufficient detail to fact-check effectively without additional context, such as the specific budget plan being referred to and the definition of 'balancing the budget'. Therefore, the score is relatively low."
32839,1,100,"Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.","This sentence contains a factual claim about the percentage of votes received during a re-election campaign.

23821,1,0,"I was not put on the ballot by either of the 2 parties; I was not put on the ballot by any PAC money, by any foreign lobbyist money, by any special interest money.",This sentence is non-checkworthy as it only contains statements about the speaker's personal experiences and does not contain any factual claims that can be verified using publicly available information.
6022,1,20,"So Senator Obama, who has never traveled south of our border, opposes the Colombia Free Trade Agreement.","This sentence contains a factual claim about Senator Obama's travel history, but it is not salient to the general public as it is specific to him and does not have broader implications.

However, it does not provide enough specific information to fact-check the claim effectively. A score of 50 is given due to the presence of a factual claim, but the lack of sufficient detail makes it difficult to determine the accuracy of the statement."
26811,1,80,"President Clinton opposes term limits, President Clinton opposes a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.","This sentence contains two factual claims about President Clinton's stance on term limits and a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. These claims are salient to the general public as they relate to significant political issues. However, the score is not 100 because the sentence does not provide any specific information about when or where President Clinton expressed these views, making it difficult to fact-check the claims with absolute certainty using publicly available information."
16866,1,50,"President Truman vetoed on the average, while he was president, about thirty-eight bills a year.","This statement contains a factual claim about the number of bills vetoed by President Truman per year on average.

However, it is not clear whether this claim is salient to the general public or not. Additionally, the statement also includes an opinionated statement about the speaker's belief and the belief of the American people regarding quotas. Therefore, the check-worthiness score is moderate."
3582,1,0,Do you know that it's tripled in the last five years?,This sentence is non check-worthy as it contains a question and a subjective statement 'it's tripled' without providing any factual information.

The term'most liberal' is subjective, but it can be determined by looking at the voting records and positions of various senators. The term 'big-spending' can be checked by looking at the budgets and appropriations bills sponsored or supported by the senator in question. A high score would indicate a senator with a consistently liberal voting record and a history of sponsoring or supporting large budgets and appropriations bills."

It is a statement about an action taken (doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars), but it does not provide any information about the specifics of the action or its impact. Therefore, it is not possible to fact-check this sentence using publicly available information."

9623,1,80,"I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America.","The sentence contains a factual claim about the number of women in senior leadership positions in the speaker's state compared to other states. The claim can be fact-checked using publicly available data from the University of New York in Albany survey.

26477,1,100,"We had a 1.2 million bankruptcy, set a new record.",This sentence contains a factual claim about a specific bankruptcy filing with a quantifiable amount. It is salient to the general public as bankruptcy filings are a matter of public record and financial significance.

13417,1,80,The fa- the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twenty-five-cent loaf of bread.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about the amount of money a farmer gets from the sale of a loaf of bread. However, it is not clear where the specific figure of 'two and a half cents' comes from, and it may vary depending on various factors such as location, market conditions, and specific farming practices.

19153,1,0,"Don't forget that, that happened in 1993.","This sentence only contains a reference to a specific historical event and the year it occurred. It does not contain any factual claims that can be checked using publicly available information. Therefore, it is non-checkworthy."
13953,1,30,And it's true on this and it's true on CAFE.,"The sentence contains references to 'this' and CAFE, but it's unclear what 'this' refers to and whether it contains any factual claims. CAFE could potentially be a factual claim, but more context is needed to determine its check-worthiness."

However, it is not clear whether the law still exists or if it applies to the specific situation being discussed. Therefore, the claim is not fully check-worthy without additional context."

However, it is not clear where this statistic comes from, so the check-worthiness score is reduced accordingly."
2321,1,50,We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s.,"This statement is subjective and lacks clear factual claims. The term 'toughest reforms' is an opinion and the timeframe'since the 1930s' is a vague historical reference. To fact-check this statement, we would need to identify and quantify the specific reforms being referred to and compare them to other reforms in terms of impact and scope."
34061,1,60,There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about a specific number of years that the person in question did not receive an Emmy award.

24455,1,50,Seventy-two other nations have been able to do it.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about the number of nations that have been able to do something, but it does not specify what that something is. In order to fact-check this claim, we would need to know what the ability in question is. Without this information, it is difficult to determine the exact number of nations that meet the criteria and thus the claim cannot be fact-checked with 100% accuracy. Therefore, the check-worthiness score is set to 50."
2093,1,30,"Now, I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas receives.",This statement contains a subjective opinion ('I like green energy') and a vague claim ('about 50 years' worth'). The factual claim about the amount of funding for green energy compared to oil and gas would require specific and publicly available data to fact-check.
18417,1,100,"And meanwhile, North Korea has got nuclear weapons.","This statement is factual and salient to the general public as it refers to North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons, which is a significant geopolitical issue."

580,1,50,"And because we didn't listen to the freeze advocates, and strengthen the defense of this country, we now have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age.","This sentence contains a claim about the outcome of not listening to 'freeze advocates' and the subsequent 'first arms control agreement in the nuclear age'. However, without more context or specific information about which nuclear arms control agreement is being referred to, it is difficult to fact-check this claim using publicly available information. Additionally, the sentence does not provide enough detail to determine the accuracy of the claim that 'we didn't listen to the freeze advocates'. Therefore, a score of 50 is given, indicating that the sentence is somewhat check-worthy but requires additional context to be fully fact-checked."
14940,1,30,The President's economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way.,"This sentence contains a claim about the President's economic plan and the potential impact on taxpayers to balance the budget. However, the sentence does not provide specific numbers or facts to determine the accuracy of the claim.

1546,1,50,We have cut inflation by better than half.,"This statement is checkworthy because it contains a factual claim about inflation. However, the claim is vague and lacks specificity, making it difficult to fact-check without more context. For example, we would need to know the specific rate of inflation before and after the statement was made to accurately assess the claim. Therefore, the check-worthiness score is relatively low."
30118,1,80,"Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.","This statement contains a factual claim about the number of countries in NATO and some of them not paying their fair share. However, it is not clear what constitutes a 'fair share' and how this information can be fact-checked using publicly available data. Therefore, the score is not 100 but rather 80, as some uncertainty remains regarding the specific factual claims made in the sentence."
1882,1,100,"The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs.",This sentence contains a clear factual claim about the number of jobs that the National Federation of Independent Businesses has stated will be lost.

26988,1,50,Russia does continue to battle us in the U.N. time and time again.,"This sentence contains a claim that Russia is 'battling' the U.S. in the U.N., but it does not provide specific details or evidence to support this claim. Without more context or information, it is difficult to fact-check this statement definitively. However, it is a common occurrence for countries to have disagreements and conflicts in international organizations like the U.N., so the claim is not necessarily implausible. Therefore, I assign it a medium check-worthiness score of 50."
21704,1,90,Thirty years ago there were three police officers on the street for every crime; today there are three crimes for every police officer.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about the ratio of police officers to crimes, which is a matter of public interest and can be fact-checked using historical crime statistics and police force data."
28958,1,85,He has promised a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund for young working adults to invest and save on their own.,"This statement contains a factual claim about a promise made by an individual (a trillion dollars) and a group (young working adults). However, it is not clear whether the promise was actually made or if the funds exist. Therefore, the score is not 100, but rather 85, as the claim may not be entirely factual."
14910,1,95,"As a matter of fact, we're importing today about one-third less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago.","This statement contains a factual claim about the amount of oil imported from overseas, which can be verified using publicly available data from sources such as the U.S. Energy Information Administration."

This claim is factual and salient to the general public, as it relates to a significant international agreement and a large sum of money. Therefore, the sentence is check-worthy, and I would assign it a high score, perhaps around 90. The reasoning is that the claim is factual, and it is a significant statement that is relevant to many people. However, it would be necessary to fact-check the exact amount given to Iran under the deal to ensure the accuracy of the claim."
10803,1,90,"Now, in contrast, Senator McCain wants to give a $300 billion tax cut, $200 billion of it to the largest corporations and a hundred thousand of it -- a hundred billion of it going to people like CEOs on Wall Street.",This sentence contains a factual claim about the amount of money ($300 billion) that Senator McCain wants to give as a tax cut and the distribution of that money ($200 billion to corporations and $100 billion to CEOs on Wall Street).

31995,1,100,"But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law.","This sentence contains factual claims that are salient to the general public.

However, it does not provide any specific information about the president or the context of the proposal, making it a somewhat vague claim. Additionally, the claim does not appear to be particularly salient to the general public, as insurance premium increases are a common occurrence and may not be of significant interest to many people. Therefore, the check-worthiness score is set to 60."
11493,1,50,The sanctions are being violated.,"This sentence contains a factual claim, but it is not clear who is violating the sanctions or what specific sanctions are being referred to. To fact-check this claim, we would need more context or additional information."

18198,1,80,"We've got 1,000 extra border patrol on the southern border; want 1,000 on the northern border.","This statement contains a factual claim about the number of extra border patrol agents on the southern border. However, it also includes an opinionated statement about wanting 1,000 more agents on the northern border, which reduces the check-worthiness score."
5975,1,95,"Look, we've sailed Navy ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them.",This statement contains a factual claim about the length of time that Navy ships have been sailing with nuclear power plants on them.

8129,1,50,I'm not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are.,"This statement contains a factual claim about the number of scientists and engineers produced by the Soviet Union and the US. However, it is not clear how this information is salient to the general public or how it would be fact-checked using publicly available information. Therefore, it is given a medium check-worthiness score."
12712,1,30,His influence is growing - mostly because this Administration has ignored Latin America.,"This sentence contains a subjective claim about the 'growing influence' of an unspecified person or entity. While it is mentioned that this is due to the current Administration's actions towards Latin America, the sentence does not provide any quantifiable or factual information to support the claim. Therefore, it is considered non-checkworthy."
23488,1,80,"The Patriot Act is necessary, for example, because parts of the FBI couldn't talk to each other.","This statement contains a factual claim that the FBI had communication issues before the Patriot Act was passed. However, it is not clear to what extent these communication issues were addressed by the Act, and whether the Act was the only solution to this problem. Therefore, the claim is factual but not entirely salient to the general public, and a more specific fact-check would be required to determine the full extent of the issue and the Act's impact on it."
9448,1,95,The top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation collects.,"This statement is checkworthy as it contains a factual claim about the distribution of income tax payments among taxpayers, which is a matter of public interest."

It only mentions what 'he' (presumably a political opponent)'said' about Iran and the imposition of sanctions. There is no new factual information presented in this sentence, and it does not provide any publicly available data that can be fact-checked."
14896,1,80,"The most recent figures, the last three months, on the third quarter of this year, the inflation rate is 7% - still too high, but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of jobs - nine million new jobs in the last three and a half years - that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us.","The sentence contains factual claims about the inflation rate and the number of jobs created in the last three and a half years. These claims can be fact-checked using publicly available data from sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics or the Federal Reserve. However, the sentence also includes subjective statements such as'still too high' and 'urgent on us,' which may make it more difficult to determine the exact truth of the claim. Therefore, the score is set at 80 to reflect the presence of factual claims but also the potential for some subjectivity or interpretation."
8434,1,30,Teachers' salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about the percentage increase in teachers' salaries and other salaries over the last eight years. However, the claim lacks specificity and citation, making it difficult to fact-check with publicly available information. Additionally, the use of the word 'fortunately' implies a subjective interpretation of the increase in teachers' salaries, which further reduces the claim's check-worthiness."
13362,1,80,We've spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before that.,"This statement contains a factual claim about the amount of money spent on agriculture in the last eight years compared to the hundred years before it. However, without access to specific data or reliable sources, it is difficult to determine the exact figures and verify the claim with 100% accuracy. Therefore, a score of 80 is assigned, indicating a high level of check-worthiness due to the potential impact of the claim and the need for factual verification."
16658,1,0,But that doesn't cost any more as far as the federal treasury is concerned.,This sentence does not contain any factual claims that are checkworthy as it only expresses an opinion about the cost to the federal treasury.
21311,1,80,"Pay $1 an hour for your labor, have no health care -- that's the most expensive single element in making the car.","This sentence contains a factual claim about the most expensive single element in making a car, which is the cost of labor and healthcare for workers. However, it does not provide a specific amount for the cost of healthcare, making the claim incomplete and potentially subject to interpretation. Therefore, the score is not perfect, but still relatively high due to the presence of a factual claim."
1577,1,0,We never increased sales taxes or income tax or property tax.,"This sentence is a statement of fact about a specific policy decision made by a government entity. However, it is not check-worthy because it is not possible to fact-check this claim using publicly available information. To fact-check this claim, one would need access to the government's budget records and tax codes, which are not publicly available in their entirety. Additionally, tax policies can be complex and subject to change over time, making it difficult to determine the accuracy of this claim without extensive research. Therefore, this sentence is not check-worthy."
20110,1,80,"Republicans talk about it, but we're the first the first administration in anybody's lifetime looking at this program to bring that deficit down four years in a row.","This statement contains a factual claim about the number of years in a row that the deficit has been brought down by the current administration. The claim can be fact-checked using publicly available data from the US Treasury or the Congressional Budget Office. However, the claim is not definitively true or false without further context, as there might be other administrations in history that have also brought down the deficit for four consecutive years. Therefore, the score is set to 80, indicating a moderately check-worthy statement."
6862,1,85,Result: $139 billion windfall profit to the drug companies coming out of your pockets.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about a financial amount ($139 billion) and its source (drug companies). It is salient to the general public as it relates to healthcare costs and potential profits made by pharmaceutical companies. However, it is important to fact-check the accuracy of the specific financial figure and the source of the profit."
29128,1,50,Our jobs are fleeing the country.,"This statement is somewhat checkworthy as it implies a factual claim about the movement of jobs. However, it is not clear who 'our' refers to, what country is being referred to, and in what time frame the jobs are leaving. Without this information, it would be difficult to fact-check the statement definitively."
1368,1,80,"And uh - the only purpose that I would see in registering uh - handguns and not long guns of any kind would be to prohibit the uh - ownership of those guns by those who've used them in the commission of a crime, or who uh - have been proven to be mentally incompetent to own a gun.","This sentence contains a factual claim about the potential purpose of handgun registration, which is to prohibit ownership by criminals and the mentally incompetent.

9195,1,80,"But if you calculated that unemployment rate, taking back the people who dropped out of the workforce, it would be 10.7 percent.","This sentence contains a factual claim about the unemployment rate with a specific percentage (10.7%). However, it also mentions 'taking back the people who dropped out of the workforce,' which might require additional context or data to fact-check accurately. Therefore, the score is not 100 because of the potential complexity in obtaining the necessary information to fact-check the claim fully."
3666,1,0,And that's just a fact.,This sentence does not contain any factual claims that are checkworthy or salient to the general public.
1298,1,100,"There've been over thirteen hundred indictments in HUD, over eight hundred convictions relating just to home loans.","This sentence contains two factual claims that are both salient and publicly available. The first claim is about the number of indictments in HUD (Housing and Urban Development), and the second claim is about the number of convictions relating to home loans. Both claims can be fact-checked using publicly available information from reliable sources such as government reports and court records."
1723,1,95,"And this is where there's a difference, because Governor Romney's central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut -- on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts -- that's another trillion dollars -- and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn't asked for.","This sentence contains factual claims about the proposed economic plans of Governor Romney, including the amount of tax cuts and military spending. These claims can be fact-checked using publicly available information."
1782,1,0,And that's exactly what I did.,"This sentence is non-checkworthy as it only contains a first-person statement about an action, which is not factual or salient to the general public."
10708,1,30,I first proposed a long time ago that we would have to examine every agency and every bureaucracy of government.,This statement is factual but it is not checkworthy because it is not salient to the general public. It is a statement about a specific event in the past (the speaker's proposal) and does not contain any significant factual claims that would be of interest to a wide audience.
27914,1,50,"And the one thing that I'm absolutely clear about is that after a decade in which we saw drift, jobs being shipped overseas, nobody championing American workers and American businesses, we've now begun to make some real progress.","This sentence contains a subjective statement 'we've now begun to make some real progress' which is not easily fact-checked using publicly available information. However, it also mentions 'a decade in which we saw drift, jobs being shipped overseas, nobody championing American workers and American businesses'. These claims can be fact-checked using publicly available data such as employment statistics, trade data, and political records. Therefore, the sentence as a whole is given a moderate check-worthiness score of 50."
2930,1,80,The secretary of state has appeared in the several years that he's been the secretary before eighty different uh - committee hearings in the House and in the Senate.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about the number of committee hearings the secretary of state has appeared in.

It also implies a successful outcome, which can be fact-checked using publicly available information. However, it is not a definitive statement about the existence or details of the peace treaty, and further investigation would be required to determine the exact nature of the defense capability mentioned."
19926,1,100,We've made every one of them eligible for a tax cut.,This statement is checkworthy as it contains a factual claim about a policy change (tax cuts) that affects a large group of people (every one of them) and is of public interest.
33347,1,0,"They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people.","This sentence contains two claims, but neither of them are factual or salient to the general public. The first claim, 'They have 4 million American citizen children,' is subjective and lacks specificity as it does not identify who 'they' are. The second claim, '15 million people,' is a vague and non-specific number that does not provide any context or factual information."
27760,1,0,"It's not my term, it's the president's own Secretary of Defense, called them devastating.","This sentence is non-checkworthy as it contains no factual claims that are salient to the general public. The sentence only expresses the opinion of the Secretary of Defense and the speaker's interpretation of that opinion as ""devastating."" There is no publicly available information that can be used to fact-check this statement. Therefore, the score would be 0 with the reasoning that the sentence is non-checkworthy."
29556,1,100,"For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns.",This statement is factual and salient to the general public. It is a well-established fact that U.S. presidential candidates have released their tax returns for the past several decades. This information is widely reported and easily verifiable through news articles and official campaign websites.
28132,1,0,"Listen, for 24 years I have never been afraid to take on the big drug companies.",This sentence is non-checkworthy as it is an opinion statement and does not contain any factual claims.
32011,1,80,He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching.,"This statement contains a factual claim about He not apologizing to a reporter, which is salient to the public as it involves a public figure and an incident that occurred on national television. However, the claim that 'our children were watching' is subjective and not publicly verifiable, which reduces the score."
24074,1,0,"We collect 35 cents, and we don't have it to spend.",This sentence is non-checkworthy as it only contains a trivial factual claim about having or not having 35 cents to spend.
17149,1,100,"And, as a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history took place 1977.","This statement is factual and salient to the general public as it refers to a historical fact.

The sentence is more of a statement of encouragement and does not provide enough detail to be fact-checked."
9733,1,100,"Well, in fact we saved 1,000 jobs.","The sentence contains a clear factual claim about saving 1,000 jobs, which is a significant number and relevant to the general public."
28924,1,100,"Not only has an innocent person been executed, but the real perpetrator of the crime has not been held accountable for it.","This sentence contains two factual claims: 1) an innocent person has been executed, and 2) the real perpetrator of the crime has not been held accountable.

24603,1,0,We've doubled it on research and on every other aspect of it.,This sentence does not contain any factual claims that are checkworthy. It only mentions an action ('doubled it') without specifying what 'it' refers to or providing any quantifiable information.
16712,1,80,We now import about 44 percent of our oil.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about the percentage of oil imported by the country, which is a matter of public interest and can be fact-checked using data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration or other reliable sources."
26366,1,50,"The bill originally covered employers of 25 and more, but because of opposition, we went up to 50.","This sentence mentions a change in the number of employees covered by a bill, which is a factual claim. However, it does not provide a specific number for the original bill or the current bill, making it difficult to fact-check with publicly available information. Therefore, the check-worthiness score is set to 50, which is a medium score. The reasoning is that while the sentence contains a factual claim, it lacks sufficient detail to be easily fact-checked."
20428,1,0,Today we import one million barrels from Saddam Hussein.,"This sentence is non check-worthy as it contains a factual error and a reference to a specific individual who is not currently importing oil in the quantity mentioned. Saddam Hussein was the former President of Iraq and was overthrown in 2003. Iraq is now a member of OPEC and exports oil on the global market. Therefore, it is not possible to fact-check the claim using publicly available information."
33361,1,80,He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.,"This sentence contains a factual claim that 'we're not paying for that wall'. This claim can be fact-checked using publicly available information, such as news articles and government statements. The score is reduced due to the inclusion of the 'Twitter war' element, which is subjective and less salient to the general public."
15772,1,0,"And the result is, we deployed, and the Soviets kept deploying, and then we negotiated from strength.",This sentence is non-checkworthy as it only contains a statement about past events (deploying and negotiating) and does not contain any factual claims that can be checked using publicly available information.
26113,1,80,"Part of my tax package which is paid for in my balanced budget plan would exempt up to half a million dollars in gains from people when they sell their homes, which I think is the biggest capital gains benefit we could give to most ordinary Americans.","The sentence contains a factual claim about the tax package and the amount of gains exempted. However, the claim about it being the 'biggest capital gains benefit we could give to most ordinary Americans' is subjective and may vary depending on the context and other factors, hence reducing the score."
19342,1,0,"That's what Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole did, not me.",This sentence is a denial of an action and does not contain any factual claims that can be checked using publicly available information.

1535,1,95,"We had inflation of over 12 percent, we were on the brink of the worst recession in the last forty years, we were still deeply involved in the problems of Vietnam.","This sentence contains multiple factual claims that are salient to the general public. The first claim, 'We had inflation of over 12 percent,' is a factual statement about an economic indicator. The second claim, 'we were on the brink of the worst recession in the last forty years,' is also a factual statement about an economic condition. The third claim, 'we were still deeply involved in the problems of Vietnam,' is a factual statement about a historical event. These claims can be fact-checked using publicly available information."
27585,1,60,"I mean, the president received a letter from 38 Democrat senators saying the tensions with Israel were a real problem.","This sentence contains a factual claim about 38 Democrat senators sending a letter to the president. However, it does not provide enough information to definitively fact-check the claim, such as the date of the letter or the specific content of the letter. Additionally, the sentence implies that the tensions with Israel are a real problem, which is a subjective opinion. Therefore, the score is set at 60, indicating a moderately check-worthy claim."
13260,1,50,"Senator Kennedy quotes the record, which he read from a moment ago, but what he forgets to point out is that the key vote - a uh - vote which I've referred to several times - where he was in the minority was one which rejected his position.","This sentence contains a claim about Senator Kennedy forgetting to mention a key vote where he was in the minority. However, it does not provide enough information to fact-check this claim directly. It only mentions that Kennedy forgot to mention it, but not where or when this supposedly happened. Additionally, it refers to a'record' that was read earlier, but it is unclear what this record is or how it relates to the key vote in question. Therefore, the check-worthiness score is moderate, as it may contain a factual claim, but more information is needed to fact-check it accurately."
6866,1,60,"So whether it's diabetes or cancer, they come to hospitals later and it costs America more.","This sentence contains a claim about the cost of healthcare for diabetes and cancer, which is factual and salient to the general public. However, it is not clear whether the claim is about the total cost or the cost per patient, and it does not specify a time frame or a source for the data.

10888,1,80,"We're going to have to come up with alternatives, and that means that the United States government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like China that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week.","This sentence contains a factual claim about the number of coal power plants China is setting up per week. This information can be fact-checked using publicly available data from sources such as the International Energy Agency or the National Bureau of Statistics of China. The claim about the United States government working with the private sector to fund innovation is also factual, but it may be more challenging to find specific data to support this claim, as it would likely require researching government policies and private sector partnerships. However, this claim is not the primary focus of the sentence and does not significantly impact the overall factual accuracy of the statement."
18338,1,20,"Plus, he says the cornerstone of his plan to succeed in Iraq is to call upon nations to serve.","This sentence contains a claim about a specific plan of a person (the speaker in this context), but it is not clear what the plan entails or if it is factual. It is also not clear which nations the speaker is referring to or if they have agreed to serve. Without more context or information, it is difficult to fact-check this claim."
12548,1,80,"First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have - if the should launch a surprise attack - we will be able to destroy their war-making capability.","This sentence contains a factual claim about the United States being the strongest nation militarily and the need to increase military strength. However, the claim about the potential opponents launching a surprise attack and the ability to destroy their war-making capability are speculative and not publicly verifiable, which reduces the score."

These claims can be fact-checked using publicly available information, such as news articles and reports from international organizations. However, the sentence does not provide specific details about the location, extent, or timing of the land grab or the cease-fire, which could limit the accuracy of the fact-checking effort. Therefore, the score is not perfect, but still relatively high due to the presence of factual claims."
13382,1,80,And I would also point out that Senator Kennedy left out a part of the cost of that program - a twenty-five percent rise in food prices that the people would have to pay.,"This statement contains a factual claim about a 'twenty-five percent rise in food prices' which can be fact-checked using publicly available information. However, it is important to note that the sentence also includes an opinionated statement about Senator Kennedy 'leaving out a part' of the cost, which may not be easily fact-checked and could potentially lower the score if more context is needed to determine its factual accuracy."
33867,1,0,"And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked.","This sentence is non check-worthy as it contains a statement that those stories have been debunked, which is an opinion and not a factual claim that can be fact-checked using publicly available information."
26970,1,100,"You indicated that we shouldn't be passing nuclear treaties with Russia despite the fact that 71 senators, Democrats and Republicans, voted for it.",This sentence contains a factual claim about the number of senators who voted for a nuclear treaty with Russia.

3532,1,80,"And Main Street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in Washington, D.C., and in the Wall Street.","This sentence contains a claim that Main Street is paying a penalty, which is factual and salient to the general public.

The first claim is that Detroit is being taxed for money that will go to Chicago. However, it is not clear who is making this claim, or what specific taxes and funds are being referred to. The second claim is that Chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in Philadelphia. Again, it is not clear who is making this claim, or what specific taxes and funds are being referred to. Without more context or specific information, it is not possible to fact-check these claims."

It also mentions the number of candidates on the ballot. These facts can be fact-checked using publicly available election data. However, the sentence also includes an opinionated statement about Governor Wallace's strength in Georgia, which may not be easily fact-checkable using publicly available information. Therefore, the score is not perfect, but still relatively high due to the presence of a clear factual claim."
16790,1,95,"Well, Mr. Ford doesn't seem to put into perspective the fact that when - when uh five hundred thousand more people are out of work than there were three months ago, while we have two and a half million more people out of work than were when he took office, that this touches human beings.","The sentence contains factual claims about the number of people out of work before and after Mr. Ford took office. These claims are salient to the general public as they touch on employment statistics, which is a significant issue."
15041,1,95,"Since I've been President, I've appointed, for instance, more than twice as many black Federal judges as all previous presidents in the history of this country.",This statement contains a factual claim about the number of black Federal judges appointed by the President. The claim can be fact-checked using publicly available information such as the Federal Judicial Center's database of federal judges. The claim is also salient to the general public as it touches on issues of diversity and representation in the judiciary.
1973,1,85,That's the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower.,"This statement contains a factual claim about a budget cut and a timeframe referencing Dwight Eisenhower, which is a historically significant figure. However, it would require additional research to identify the specific budget cut being referred to and to confirm that it is indeed the largest since Eisenhower's presidency. Therefore, the score is not 100 as there is some degree of uncertainty and factual detail that needs to be verified."
24058,1,0,"And I simply don't believe we can afford nor do we need to keep 150,000 troops in Europe given how much the Red Army, now under the control of Russia, has been cut, the arms control agreement concluded between Mr. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin, something I have applauded.","This sentence contains no factual claims that are checkworthy. It only expresses an opinion about the number of troops needed in Europe and the current state of the Russian military, which are subjective statements."
3688,1,80,"They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care.","This sentence contains a factual claim about businesses going bankrupt as a consequence of health care. However, it is not clear who 'they' are referring to, and more context is needed to determine the exact number or percentage of businesses affected. Therefore, the score is not 100, but rather 80, as the claim is factual but incomplete."
33223,1,0,"But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.","This sentence does not contain any factual claims that are checkworthy. It is a statement about an intent to save lives, which is subjective and not publicly verifiable."

These claims can be fact-checked using publicly available information, such as government reports and news articles. The score is reduced slightly due to the presence of some subjective language, such as'makes me question' and 'assaults on whether I am the one who is quick to look for use of force', but the factual claims are the primary focus of the sentence."

The claim can be fact-checked using publicly available information from sources such as the Internal Revenue Service or the Congressional Budget Office.
32594,1,50,Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system.,"This sentence contains a claim about the number of kids who have a chance to be adopted, but the number is not specific enough to be fact-checked using publicly available information.

However, the claim is vague and lacks specificity, which reduces the confidence in the accuracy of the fact-check.

24429,1,80,"But it is inappropriate for us, just because there's a problem somewhere around the world, to take the sons and daughters of working people--and make no mistake about it, our all- volunteer armed force is not made up of the sons and daughters of the beautiful people; it's the working folks who send their sons and daughters to war, with a few exceptions.","This statement contains a factual claim about the demographic makeup of the US military. It is a matter of public record that the military is primarily made up of individuals from working-class backgrounds. However, the statement also includes an opinionated element, as it implies a moral judgment about who 'the beautiful people' are. This could make it more difficult to fact-check definitively using publicly available information, and may limit the scope of the fact-check to the specific demographic data. Therefore, the score is set at 80, reflecting the factual core of the statement but acknowledging the potential complexity of a full fact-check."
1447,1,80,"Now we've had this pause, but most economists, regardless of their political philosophy, uh - indicate that this pause for a month or two was healthy, because we could not have honestly sustained a 9.2 percent rate of growth which we had in the first quarter of this year.","This sentence contains a factual claim about the economic growth rate in the first quarter of the year, which is publicly available information. The claim that most economists indicate that a pause was healthy given this growth rate is also factual and can be supported by various sources.

Therefore, the score is not perfect, but still relatively high due to the presence of multiple factual claims."

10156,1,85,They used those weapons against -- against their own citizens and killed Americans with them.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about the use of weapons against citizens and the killing of Americans. However, it is not clear who 'they' refers to, and additional context or information would be needed to fully fact-check the claim. Therefore, the score is not 100, but rather 85 to reflect the incomplete nature of the information provided."
3639,1,50,"Now, what he doesn't tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits."," The score is 50. The reasoning is that while the sentence does contain a factual claim about a proposed tax policy, it is not salient to the general public as it is specific to a particular individual (the person being referred to in the sentence) and does not provide any quantifiable information about the tax or its impact. Additionally, the sentence does not provide any context or background information about the proposed tax or the historical context of taxing health benefits, making it difficult to fact-check without further information."
8151,1,95,"Seventeen million Americans, who live over sixty-five on an average Social Security check of about seventy-eight dollars a month, they're not able to sustain themselves individually, but they can sustain themselves through the social security system.","This sentence contains factual claims about the number of Americans receiving Social Security benefits, their age, and the average monthly benefit amount.

These claims can be fact-checked using publicly available data on student loan debt and employment statistics in various fields.

24709,1,0,"I'm the president that stood up and said, don't mess with Social Security, and I'm not going to and we haven't and we are not going to go after the Social Security recipient.","This sentence is non-checkworthy as it contains a subjective statement ('I'm the president that stood up...') and opinion-centered statements ('I'm not going to...', 'we haven't...', 'we are not going to...'). It also does not contain any factual claims that can be checked using publicly available information."
33415,1,0,But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.,This sentence is non-checkworthy as it only contains an opinionated statement about President Obama's actions without providing any factual claims or specific numbers.
14956,1,30,And inflation went down below the national average in California when we returned the money to the people and reduced Government spending.,"This sentence contains a claim about inflation in California going below the national average after returning money to the people and reducing government spending. However, it is not clear if this claim is factual or not, as there is no specific data provided to support it. Additionally, the sentence mentions 'when we returned the money to the people' which is vague and could refer to various policies or events. Therefore, the claim lacks sufficient information to be fact-checked using publicly available data, and is given a low check-worthiness score."
25216,1,80,"And then 5 days before the troops were killed, they went back to the President, through the Secretary of Defense, and said, ""Please, Mr. President, take those troops out of there because we can't defend them.''","This sentence contains a factual claim about the troops going back to the President and requesting to be taken out of a certain location. However, it does not provide enough context or specific details to fact-check the claim effectively. A score of 80 is given due to the presence of a factual claim."

31871,1,80,"Just today, policemen was shot, two killed.","This sentence contains a factual claim about the shooting and death of two policemen. However, it does not specify the location or number of policemen involved beyond 'was shot' and 'two killed'. Providing more context or details would increase the check-worthiness score."

There is no publicly available information that can be used to fact-check this statement. Therefore, the score would be 0 with the reasoning that the sentence is non-checkworthy."
6908,1,0,"I think they'll choose it, because it's a net plus of $5 billion to them.","This sentence is non check-worthy as it only contains an opinion and a statement about a financial gain, which is a trivial factual claim."

8949,1,50,We cut the rate of increase in spending in half.,"This sentence contains a claim about reducing the rate of increase in spending, but it does not specify a numerical value or a time frame. Without this information, it is difficult to fact-check the claim using publicly available data. Therefore, the check-worthiness score is set to 50."

However, it would require some research to determine the exact weapons being referred to and whether they have been modified in a way that allows them to be considered legal again. Therefore, the score is not 100 because there is some degree of uncertainty or ambiguity in the claim."
29729,1,100,"And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants.",This sentence contains a factual claim about immigrants being 'illegally here' which is a matter of public interest and can be fact-checked using publicly available information.

However, it is not clear from the sentence whether the claim is salient to the general public or not.

However, it does not provide enough specific information to fact-check the claims directly.

16651,1,100,"We were faced with uh - heavy inflation, over 12 percent; we were faced with substantial unemployment.","This sentence contains two factual claims: heavy inflation with a rate over 12%, and substantial unemployment.

However, it would require additional information to fact-check this claim accurately, such as the time period in question and the source of the statistic. Therefore, the score is not 100, but rather 80, as some additional fact-checking is required."
28498,1,0,"You know, we won that conflict in Kosovo without losing a single human life in combat, a single American life in combat.","This statement is not checkworthy as it is an opinion and an overgeneralization. There were indeed American soldiers in Kosovo during the conflict, and while the number of casualties was relatively low compared to other conflicts, it is not accurate to claim that 'zero' American lives were lost in combat."
1211,1,95,"I have fully funded the land and water conservation program; in fact, have recommended and the Congress approved a substantially increased land and water conservation program.","This statement contains a factual claim about the speaker funding and increasing a specific program.

However, the statement does not provide a specific number, only that there are 24 such individuals. Additionally, the statement mentions the deputy commander of Desert Storm, who endorsed the speaker, which adds some level of credibility to the claim. However, without access to a reliable source that lists all the retired generals and admirals who have endorsed the speaker, it is difficult to fact-check the claim with 100% accuracy. Therefore, the score is set to 70."
3132,1,0,Those gray-area weapons systems are creating some problems in a - the agreement for a SALT II negotiation.,"This sentence contains multiple issues that make it non-checkworthy. First, it uses the vague term 'those gray-area weapons systems,' which is not defined in the sentence.

The claim can be fact-checked by researching economists' views on the Perot prescription and its potential effects on employment and the economy.

Therefore, the score is not 100, but rather 80, to reflect the qualitative nature of the claim and the potential for varying opinions among economists."
14961,1,80,"One of those ideas was to repeal the minimum wage, and several times this year, Governor Reagan has said that the major cause of unemployment is the minimum wage.","This sentence contains a factual claim about Governor Reagan's position on the minimum wage and its potential impact on unemployment. However, it is important to note that the claim requires further fact-checking to determine if it is accurate and to what extent. For instance, one would need to examine the specific statements made by Governor Reagan on the issue and the available economic data to assess the causal relationship between the minimum wage and unemployment."
19340,1,80,"Secondly, Senator Dole had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money, but it wasn't me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who were subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up for the Federal government when we tried to stop the advertising, marketing, and sales of tobacco to children.","This sentence contains factual claims about Senator Dole's comments and actions regarding tobacco and children.

However, it also includes an opinionated statement about the speaker's unwillingness to admit Vietnam to the UN based on this fact.

However, it would be necessary to find a reliable source to confirm this claim and determine the magnitude of the change.

Therefore, while the claim is factual, it is not a straightforward fact to check and would require some research to verify."

However, the general public may be interested in knowing whether such a reversal occurred during a visit from a foreign leader, so the sentence has some check-worthiness."

However, it would require some effort to fact-check this claim as the exact amount may not be readily available in a single source.

However, it is not a clear-cut fact and would require some research to fact-check fully. For instance, one would need to find out how often and by how much the defense budgets were actually cut, and for which specific presidents.

However, it is important to note that the sentence implies a comparison between the two percentages, which may require additional research to determine if the trend is significant and if there is a causal relationship between the two changes. Therefore, the score is 80 instead of 100, as the comparison and potential causality are not explicitly stated in the sentence but are implied."

However, it is an opinionated statement as it uses the phrase 'that's going to come crashing down.' To fact-check this claim, we would need to find reliable sources that provide quantifiable data on the historical relationship between interest rates and stock market performance. Without such data, it is difficult to assign a definitive check-worthiness score to this sentence."
12164,1,0,And they get health care.,"This sentence does not contain any factual claims that are checkworthy. It only states that people get healthcare, which is a commonplace statement and not something that requires fact-checking."

The specific numbers (4.7%, 4.8%, 2.4%) can be fact-checked using publicly available data from sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics or the Federal Reserve. However, the sentence does not provide enough context to determine the exact time period or economic indicators being referred to, which could impact the accuracy of the factual claim. Therefore, the score is not 100, but rather 80 to reflect the incomplete information."
3173,1,100,We've got two and a half million more Americans out of work now than we had when Mr. Ford took office.,"This statement contains a clear factual claim about the number of unemployed Americans, which is a matter of public interest and can be fact-checked using publicly available data from sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics."
181,1,85,"More Americans at work today than any time in history, a greater percentage of the work force.","This sentence contains a factual claim about the number of Americans at work, which is a matter of public interest and can be fact-checked using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics or other reliable sources. However, the claim about a greater percentage of the workforce requires additional context and data to verify, which may involve more research and analysis beyond the scope of a simple fact-check. Therefore, the score is not a perfect 100, but still relatively high due to the objective nature of the primary claim."
5663,1,80,"I saved the taxpayer $6.8 billion by fighting a deal for a couple of years, as you might recall, that was a sweetheart deal between an aircraft manufacturer, DOD, and people ended up in jail.","This sentence contains a factual claim about saving $6.8 billion, which is a significant amount of money. However, it also includes the mention of people ending up in jail, which is a less quantifiable claim and may be subject to interpretation. Therefore, the score is not 100, but rather 80, as the factual claim is the primary focus and the secondary claim does not detract significantly from the overall check-worthiness of the sentence."
1343,1,0,The record just doesn't prove that such legislation or action by a local city council is effective.,"This sentence is non check-worthy as it only contains a subjective statement about the effectiveness of legislation or action by a local city council, which is a matter of opinion."

The claim is that revenues exceeded expenses up until 2015. This information can be fact-checked using publicly available data from the Social Security Administration. However, the sentence also contains an assumption that 'all retirees are going to get the promises made.' This statement is not factual and cannot be determined using publicly available information, so it lowers the overall check-worthiness score."

Without this information, it is difficult to fact-check the claim definitively.

However, it is not clear from the sentence alone whether the claim is true or false, so the score is not 100. The score is reduced because the sentence does not provide enough context or evidence to definitively determine its factual accuracy."

16781,1,0,I think it's interesting to point out that uh - in the uh - two years that I've been president I've vetoed fifty-six bills.,"The given sentence is non check-worthy as it only contains a statement about the number of bills vetoed by the speaker over a certain period of time. This is a trivial factual claim that does not provide any new or significant information to the general public. Therefore, the score would be 0. Reasoning: The sentence is a statement about the number of bills vetoed by the speaker over a certain period of time, which is a trivial factual claim that does not provide any new or significant information to the general public."

The claim is salient as it provides historical information about public perceptions during a significant historical period. However, the score is not 100 because the sentence does not provide the exact percentage or number of people in each country who held this belief, which would add more specificity and certainty to the factual claim."
27716,1,30,And they don't have the same capacities to attack the U.S. homeland and our allies as they did four years ago.,"This statement contains a claim about the military capabilities of a specific group (implied to be terrorist organizations) relative to a certain time period. However, without more context or specific information, it is difficult to fact-check this claim definitively using publicly available information.

Therefore, the check-worthiness score is relatively low."

While both claims are factual, they require further investigation to determine their accuracy. The first claim can be fact-checked by looking for reports or news articles about North Korea's recent nuclear exports. The second claim can be fact-checked by checking Russian news sources or official statements to determine if they have indeed stopped following Nunn-Lugar. However, without more context or specific information, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of these claims with certainty. Therefore, the score is set at 50, indicating that the sentence is potentially check-worthy but requires further investigation."

The specific amount and time frame mentioned can be fact-checked using publicly available data from sources such as the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

However, it is important to note that the claim is qualified as 'continued to drop' which implies a trend over a certain period of time. To fact-check this claim, one would need to access reliable sources of crime statistics in the relevant city or jurisdiction and verify the trend over the stated time period. Additionally, the statement mentions'mayors' in a general sense, so it would be necessary to identify which mayor is being referred to in order to conduct a thorough fact-check.

The names mentioned are not particularly notable in the context of the bill in question, and there is no specific quantifiable information provided. Therefore, the check-worthiness score is relatively low."
7944,1,0,We're using our steel capacity fifty-five per cent today.,"This statement is non-checkworthy as it only contains a factual claim about current usage of steel capacity, which is not salient to the general public and can be easily verified by the company itself."

Therefore, the score is set at 80, indicating a moderately check-worthy statement."
19873,1,0,"And you pick out 20,000, whether they need the money or not, and they get paid for volunteering.","This sentence is non-checkworthy as it contains no factual claims that are salient to the general public.

27557,1,80,"Which is why as president, we funded an Iron Dome program to stop those missiles.","This statement implies a factual claim that the US funded the Iron Dome program during a specific presidency. The Iron Dome program is a known military aid program, and its funding by the US government is a matter of public record.

8508,1,50,"It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House - not one Republican - and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it.","This sentence contains several factual claims, but they are not directly related to a specific, publicly verifiable fact or statistic. The number of Democrats and Republicans who voted for or against the bill is mentioned, but without further context or specificity, it is difficult to fact-check these claims definitively. Additionally, the sentence includes the speaker's interpretation of the bill's extremity, which is subjective in nature. Therefore, the check-worthiness score is set at 50."
16810,1,50,And eleven of 'em have been overridden.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about eleven overrides, but it is not clear from the sentence alone what is being overridden or by whom. Additional context or information would be needed to fact-check this claim effectively."

However, it is important to verify the accuracy of the claim using reliable sources. Additionally, the statement mentions 'this Administration,' which could refer to any administration since 1959, so it would be necessary to specify which administration is being referred to in order to fully fact-check the claim."
19635,1,80,"When he fought regulatory reform that cost the average family 6 to $7,000 a year.","This sentence contains a factual claim about the cost of regulatory reform to the average family. However, it would require additional information to fact-check accurately, such as the source of the $6,000 to $7,000 figure and the time frame of the regulatory reform in question.

While the first claim is factual and salient to the general public, the second claim is subjective and opinion-centered. Therefore, the overall check-worthiness score is moderate (50)."
1296,1,70,The bankruptcies have gone up - uh in an extraordinary degree.,"This sentence implies a factual claim about an increase in bankruptcies. However, it does not provide a specific number or percentage, making it difficult to fact-check with exact data. A score of 70 is given due to the presence of a factual claim, but the lack of quantifiable information reduces the check-worthiness."
26049,1,80,"Took it three steps, twice we sent welfare reform to the president and he vetoed it.","This sentence contains two factual claims: 'we sent welfare reform to the president twice' and 'he vetoed it'. These claims can be fact-checked using publicly available information, such as congressional records and presidential signing statements. However, the sentence does not provide enough context to determine which specific welfare reform bills were being referred to, or which president was in office at the time. Therefore, the check-worthiness score is not 100, but rather 80, as some additional fact-checking would be required to verify the claims in their entirety."

However, it is not immediately clear to the general public who the 'last candidate' refers to in a contemporary context, so the statement may require some additional context or explanation to be fully understood. Therefore, the score is set at 80 to reflect the factual nature of the statement but the potential need for some additional context or explanation to make it fully check-worthy."
27310,1,0,They're still number one today.,This sentence is non check-worthy as it only contains a subjective statement about being 'number one' without specifying a factual claim or providing any context or evidence to support it.

However, it would require additional information to fact-check the specific claims about the government not receiving taxes from these entities. For example, we would need to know the location and time period in question, as well as the tax laws and welfare programs applicable to those situations. Therefore, the score is not 100 because the claims are incomplete without additional context."
19207,1,85,We had the biggest drop in income inequality in 27 years in 1995.,This statement is checkworthy because it contains a factual claim about a significant decrease in income inequality that occurred in a specific year.

However, it is important to note that the exact number of American deaths caused by Moammar Gadhafi and Osama bin Laden may be subject to some debate, and the statement could be made more precise by specifying the context of the deaths (e.g., Libyan bombing of a US military facility in 1996). Therefore, the score is not 100, but rather 85, to reflect the potential for some degree of uncertainty or debate around the precise number of deaths attributed to each individual."

Therefore, the score is relatively low, but the sentence is still checkworthy."

12131,1,80,"49th for women with health care, and 50th for families with health care.","This sentence contains two factual claims: '49th for women with health care' and '50th for families with health care'. These claims can be fact-checked using publicly available data from sources such as the World Bank or the World Health Organization. However, the sentence does not specify which country or countries are being referred to, which could limit the accuracy of the fact-check. Therefore, the score is not perfect, but still relatively high due to the presence of two factual claims."

However, it also includes a nested claim about what Admiral Mullen said, which would require additional fact-checking to confirm.

The claim can be fact-checked using publicly available data from the USDA or Department of Defense. However, the exact number may have changed since the statement was made, so the score is not 100."

However, it does not provide any specific information about which charities are involved or the total amount of money being distributed. Without this information, it is difficult to fact-check the claim with publicly available data. Therefore, the check-worthiness score is set to 50."
2971,1,100,The Soviet Union is still jamming Radio Free Europe - Radio - uh- uh - Radio Free Europe is being jammed.,This sentence contains a factual claim that the Soviet Union is jamming Radio Free Europe. This is a significant historical event that is widely known and easily fact-checked using publicly available information.
19293,1,85,"It will actually raise taxes on nine million people and, in addition to that, it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year.","This sentence contains several factual claims: 1) 'It will actually raise taxes on nine million people' - this claim can be fact-checked using tax data from the IRS or other reliable sources. 2) 'it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year' - this claim can be fact-checked by comparing budget data from the relevant years and identifying the specific cuts mentioned in the sentence. The score is reduced slightly due to the complexity of the fact-checking task and the need to verify multiple claims."
6881,1,80,"I've actually passed 56 individual bills that I've personally written and, in addition to that, and not always under my name, there is amendments on certain bills.","This statement contains a factual claim about the number of bills passed by the speaker. However, it is not clear whether the number includes only bills written entirely by the speaker or also bills on which they contributed amendments. To fact-check this claim, we would need to access the complete legislative record of the speaker and determine the exact number of bills they authored and co-authored. Since the statement is somewhat vague, it is not a definitive fact that can be easily verified with publicly available information. Therefore, the score is set at 80, which indicates a moderately check-worthy claim."
18748,1,0,"With respect to North Korea, the real story: We had inspectors and television cameras in the nuclear reactor in North Korea.","This sentence is non-checkworthy as it only contains a past tense statement about having inspectors and television cameras in a nuclear reactor in North Korea, which is a trivial factual claim and does not provide any new or significant information that is factual and salient to the general public."

However, it is not clear which specific law is being referred to or its exact details, which could impact the factual accuracy of the statement. Additionally, the statement mentions the speaker's past involvement in the law's passage, which is not directly relevant to its factual accuracy."
23329,1,0,"I mean, these aren't make-up figures.","This sentence is non check-worthy as it does not contain any factual claims that are salient to the general public. It is an assertion about the authenticity of figures, which is subjective in nature. Therefore, the score would be 0 with the reasoning that the sentence is non check-worthy due to its subjective nature."

However, the sentence does not provide enough information to fact-check these claims. The identity of the state and the specifics of the universal health care system are not mentioned.

However, it also contains a negative statement about 'the majority of them' not receiving 'any real basic help,' which is subjective and may depend on the specific context or definition of 'help.'

14971,1,50,The size of government increased only one-sixth in California of what it increased in proportion to the population in Georgia.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about the size of government increasing in California and Georgia, but it lacks specific numbers or data to fact-check.

The figure of $50 billion is a specific, quantifiable amount and is widely reported in various sources.

Therefore, the check-worthiness score is set at 80, indicating a moderately check-worthy statement."

24017,1,80,We have reduced the number of troops that are deployed and going to be deployed.,"This statement is checkworthy because it contains a factual claim about the number of troops being deployed. However, the specific number of troops that have been reduced or are going to be deployed is not mentioned, so the score is not 100."

The claim can be fact-checked using historical productivity data from reliable sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics or the Federal Reserve."
3710,1,30,We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control.,"This sentence expresses an opinion about the costs of defense systems being out of control. While it may be true for some, it is not a factual claim that can be objectively verified or falsified using publicly available information. Therefore, it is considered non-checkworthy."
12395,1,80,"Exaggerations like, for example, only 5% of seniors receive benefits under my Medicare reform package.","This sentence contains a claim about the percentage of seniors receiving benefits under a Medicare reform package. While the exact percentage is not given, it is stated that it is an exaggeration. This implies that the actual percentage may be higher than 5%, but not by a large margin. Therefore, it is likely that a fact-check can be conducted to determine the actual percentage, making it checkworthy."
17617,1,90,"[Laughter] And people will remember that you signed the biggest tax increase in the history of California and the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States, and what are you going to do?","This sentence contains two factual claims: 'you signed the biggest tax increase in the history of California' and 'you signed the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States'. These claims can be fact-checked using publicly available information, such as tax records and news articles.

However, it is not clear which nation is being referred to, making the claim less definitive and potentially subjective. A more specific claim would increase the check-worthiness score."

However, the sentence does not provide a specific numerical value for the proposed cutback, so the exact fact-checking would require additional information."
2077,1,85,"As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we're talking about potentially a 30 -- a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time.","This statement contains a factual claim about a potential percentage cut in Medicaid over time. The claim is salient to the general public as Medicaid is a significant public health program in the US.

Therefore, the check-worthiness score is moderate."
590,1,30,It was under our administration that Mrs. Aquino came in.,"This statement is checkworthy because it makes a factual claim about which administration was in power during Mrs. Aquino's presidency. However, the statement is not very salient to the general public as it is specific to Philippine politics and may require additional context to fully understand. Therefore, the score is relatively low."
17396,1,60,We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth.,"This sentence contains a claim about schools extending their curriculum to include mathematics and science.

Without more context or specific information, it is difficult to fact-check this claim definitively."
17157,1,60,"Well, that's exactly the commitment that was made to the American people in 1980: He would never reduce benefits.","This sentence contains a claim about a commitment made in 1980 by a specific person ('He') to 'never reduce benefits'. While the claim is factual, it is not directly checkable using publicly available information as it requires access to specific historical records or statements made by the person in question. However, it is salient to the general public and touches on a political promise, making it a potentially check-worthy statement."
19551,1,0,"In Northern Ireland, in the Middle East we are better off than we were four years ago.","This sentence is non check-worthy as it contains a subjective statement 'we are better off' and a geographical error 'in Northern Ireland, in the Middle East'. The Middle East is a large region that does not include Northern Ireland."
3302,1,0,He had the facts that were released today immediately after the Mayaguez incident.,"This sentence does not contain any factual claims that are checkworthy. It only mentions an event (the Mayaguez incident) and the fact that someone had the facts related to it immediately after it occurred.

8948,1,0,And that state we controlled spending.,"This sentence does not contain any factual claims that are checkworthy. It only states that a certain state ('that state') was controlled with regards to spending, which is a subjective and vague statement."
33055,1,85,"First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business.","This sentence contains two factual claims: 1) China is illegally dumping steel in the US and 2) Donald Trump is buying steel from China for his buildings. These claims can be fact-checked using publicly available information from sources such as the US International Trade Commission and the US Census Bureau. However, it's important to note that determining the legality of China's steel exports to the US is a complex issue and may require additional research beyond the scope of a simple fact-check. Additionally, while it's a matter of public record that Trump has used Chinese steel in some of his projects, it's not clear from the sentence how extensively this is happening or what percentage of his steel purchases come from China. Therefore, the score is not a perfect 100, but still relatively high due to the presence of two factual claims."
6635,1,95,This president has taken a $5.6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see.,This statement contains a clear factual claim about a financial figure (turning a surplus into deficits) and the magnitude of the claim is significant ($5.6 trillion).

However, it is not clear what specific interest rates are being referred to, and whether they have indeed doubled under the current administration.

17860,1,50,"In 1980 -- or 1979, a person with a fixed income of $8,000 was $500 above the poverty line, and this maybe explains why there are the numbers still in poverty.","The sentence mentions a factual claim about the poverty line in 1980 (or 1979), but it is not clear what the current poverty line is and how it relates to the given income level. Without this context, it is difficult to determine the exact number of people still in poverty based on the information provided. Therefore, the claim is only partially check-worthy."

The claim can be fact-checked using publicly available information, such as diplomatic records and news articles. However, the sentence does not provide a specific number or statistic, which limits the potential score."
15280,1,20,"If it is a well-known fact that I opposed air pollution laws in California, the only thing I can possibly think of is that the President must be suggesting the law that the Federal Government tried to impose on the State of California - not a law, but regulations - that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limits of any California city, or to have a place to put it if you did drive it against their regulations.","This sentence contains a claim about the President's suggestion of a law or regulation in California, but it is not clear what the specific law or regulation is or if it is a well-known fact that the President opposed it.

19140,1,80,"We reduced more regulations, eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors.",This statement is checkworthy because it contains a factual claim about the number of regulations and programs eliminated by the speaker compared to their Republican predecessors.

34447,1,80,"We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets.","This statement contains a factual claim about the treatment of illegal immigrants and veterans in the US. However, it is a subjective statement about which group is taken care of 'better,' which introduces some degree of opinion. To fact-check this claim, we would need to gather data on the resources and services provided to both groups, which can be challenging due to the complex nature of these issues and the potential for varying definitions and measurements of 'care' and 'taking care of.' Therefore, the check-worthiness score is relatively high but not maximum."
33412,1,30,"Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders.","This sentence contains a claim about a political plan (open borders) and the potential outcome (becomes a citizen).

However, it does not provide enough specific information to fact-check these claims with publicly available information. A score of 60 is given due to the presence of factual claims, but the lack of sufficient detail makes it difficult to determine the exact truth or falsehood of the statement."
1252,1,0,"When uh - the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent.","The sentence is non check-worthy as it only contains a trivial factual claim about the Nixon-Ford Administration starting and a vague statement about ""this"" being 10 percent.

15042,1,50,"I've done the same thing in the appointment of women, and also Spanish-speaking Americans.","This sentence contains a claim about the appointment of women and Spanish-speaking Americans by the speaker. However, it is not clear who the speaker is or in what context this statement was made.

26385,1,0,The Bureau of Labor Statistics today said they made a mistake.,"This sentence only contains a statement about a mistake made by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is not a fact that can be checked using publicly available information.

While some of these claims may be factual, they lack sufficient detail and publicly available information to be definitively fact-checked. For example, 'we made historic resolutions up there' is a subjective claim that would require access to the specific resolutions in question and an understanding of their historical significance. Similarly, 'the whole world was united' is an overly broad claim that would require evidence from a wide range of sources. The claim 'our Congress was dragging its feet' is more concrete, but still lacks sufficient detail to be fact-checked definitively. Therefore, the sentence as a whole receives a medium check-worthiness score."
20162,1,60,And I would say to those I know there are more young people experimenting with drugs today than ever before; drug use has gone up.,"This statement contains a claim about an increase in drug use among young people, which is factual and salient to the general public.

The claims about Germany, Hawaii, and Rochester are specific to those locations and do not provide enough context or information to fact-check. Additionally, the claim that 'America can do it, too' is an opinion and not factual."

While these claims are factual and salient to the general public, they require further investigation to determine the specific facts and data that support them.

The first claim is that the minimum spending is thirteen and two-tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending. The second claim is that the maximum spending is eighteen billion dollars a year more than we're presently spending. These claims lack specificity and do not provide enough context to fact-check.

This information is publicly available, but it would require some research to find a credible source."
18723,1,80,"Before I was sworn in, the policy of this government was to have bilateral negotiations with North Korea.","This statement is checkworthy because it implies a factual claim about the policy of the government towards North Korea before the speaker was sworn in. However, the statement is not definitively checkworthy as it does not provide a specific time frame or clear evidence to support the claim.

It mentions Michigan and Ohio, but it does not provide any numbers or statistics to verify the claim. Additionally, it is a common observation that jobs and companies can leave certain areas, so it is not necessarily a salient or newsworthy claim."
19683,1,80,"Saddam Hussein is under a U.N. resolution not to threaten his neighbors or threaten his own, repress his own citizens.","This statement contains factual claims about Saddam Hussein's actions being under a U.N. resolution and his threats towards neighbors and citizens. However, it is important to note that the specifics of the resolution and its terms would need to be fact-checked to ensure accuracy. Additionally, the statement does not provide a clear definition of 'threaten' or'repress', which could impact the factual accuracy of the claim. Therefore, the score is set at 80 to reflect the presence of factual claims, but with some qualifications due to the need for further fact-checking."
24068,1,0,It's 10 cents a year cumulative.,This sentence does not contain any factual claims that are checkworthy or salient to the general public. It is a subjective statement about a cumulative cost of 10 cents a year.

13999,1,50,He said trickle-down economics was voodoo economics; now he's it's biggest practitioner.,"This sentence contains a claim about a person's past and present actions, but it does not provide clear factual information that can be easily checked using publicly available data. The term 'biggest practitioner' is subjective and can be interpreted differently. Therefore, it is given a medium check-worthiness score of 50."

These claims can be fact-checked using publicly available information, such as the number of students in a school and the percentage of students who receive vouchers, as well as tuition prices for private schools. However, the sentence does not provide enough context or specific numbers to determine the exact figures, which limits the score."
14475,1,80,"Now, if you believe The Washington Post and you believe this extensive study that's been done -- and I'm reading it -- right after election day this year they're going to hit us with a hundred banks, it will be a $100-billion problem.","The sentence contains a claim about an extensive study by The Washington Post and a $100-billion problem. These claims are factual and salient to the general public. However, the sentence does not provide enough information to fact-check the claims directly. To fact-check, one would need to locate the study by The Washington Post and determine the exact nature and scope of the $100-billion problem."
3341,1,80,"One of the uh - most embarrassing uh - failures of the Ford administration, and one that touches specifically on human rights, is his refusal to appoint a presidential commission to go to Vietnam, to go to Laos, to go to Cambodia and try to trade for the release of information about those who are missing in action in those wars.","This sentence contains a factual claim about a historical event (the Ford administration's refusal to appoint a presidential commission to go to Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia) and its impact on human rights (the release of information about missing in action soldiers). However, it is not clear if the sentence contains a complete and accurate statement about the event, as it mentions only three countries and does not specify the time frame or the outcome of the commission (if it was ever established). Therefore, the score is not 100, but rather 80, which indicates a high level of check-worthiness."
12926,1,80,"Then the President sent a mission, composed of Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek in the spring of fifty-five to withdraw from the two islands, because they were exposed.","This sentence contains a factual claim about a historical event (the President's mission to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to withdraw from the two islands in 1955) and the identities of the individuals involved (Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson).

14930,1,20,Mr. Carter had also promised that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight against inflation.,"This sentence contains a claim about Mr. Carter's past actions, but it is not clear if this claim is factual or not.

17656,1,60,"But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans.","This sentence contains a claim about eligibility for college loans under the previous administration. However, it is not clear what the specific eligibility criteria were, and whether they were limited to income or not. Without more context or specific information, it is difficult to fact-check this claim definitively. Therefore, it is given a medium check-worthiness score."
29041,1,0,"Highest private home ownership ever, but I'll make you one promise here."," The sentence is non check-worthy as it contains a subjective statement ""I'll make you one promise here"" and a vague claim ""Highest private home ownership ever"" without providing any factual information or context to verify it. Therefore, the score would be 0."
77,1,80,"Now, I've outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad, doubling the number of drug enforcement agents, having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together.",The sentence contains several factual claims: 'doubling the number of drug enforcement agents' and 'having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of January'. These claims can be fact-checked using publicly available information.
25600,1,85,"Since we debated 2 weeks ago, the United States and the Soviet Union have built a hundred more warheads, enough to kill millions of Americans and millions of Soviet citizens.","This sentence contains a factual claim about the number of new warheads built by the United States and the Soviet Union since a debate occurred two weeks ago. The claim is salient as it relates to international relations and nuclear weapons, which are significant public concerns. However, the claim requires the verification of an exact number, which may require access to specific and potentially restricted information. Therefore, the score is not 100 as there is some uncertainty and potential difficulty in fact-checking the claim."
6150,1,80,"Now, under Senator McCain's plan there is a strong risk that people would lose their employer-based health care.","This statement contains a factual claim about the potential impact of Senator McCain's plan on people's employer-based health care.

It mentions a specific dollar amount ($550 billion) which is a factual claim, and it also mentions potential consequences of this tax scheme such as increased deficit, higher interest rates, and increased costs for various types of loans.

2497,1,100,It was the largest expansion of private insurance.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about the size of an expansion, which is a type of factual claim that is often checkworthy. The size of an expansion is a quantifiable fact that can be verified using publicly available information."
9562,1,50,"I ran the -- the state of Massachusetts as a governor, to the extent any governor does, and balanced the budget all four years.","This sentence contains a factual claim about Governor Deval Patrick balancing the budget in Massachusetts for all four years of his term. However, it is not clear-cut and easily fact-checked as it is presented in the past tense and lacks specificity about the time frame and sources. Additionally, the sentence also includes an opinionated statement about what a governor 'does' and the extent to which they 'balance the budget.' To fact-check this claim, one would need to access reliable sources that provide detailed information about Massachusetts state budgets during Governor Patrick's term and verify that there was a balanced budget each year."
10563,1,50,"The secretary already has the power to do that in the rescue package, but it hasn't been exercised yet.","This sentence contains a factual claim about the power of the secretary, but it is not clear whether this claim is salient to the general public or not. Additionally, the sentence also mentions that the power hasn't been exercised yet, which is a trivial factual claim. Therefore, the overall check-worthiness score is moderate."
26911,1,50,"We see in -- in Libya, an attack apparently by, I think we know now, by terrorists of some kind against -- against our people there, four people dead.","The sentence mentions an attack in Libya and the death of four people. However, it does not provide enough specific information to fact-check the claim. The identity of the terrorists is not mentioned, and it is not clear who the 'our people' are. Therefore, the claim is only partially check-worthy."
17112,1,80,"Actually, in constant dollars, in the domestic side of the budget, there has been no spending increase in the 4 years that we have been here.","This statement contains a factual claim about budget spending in constant dollars over a specific time period. However, it is not clear from the sentence whether the claim is check-worthy to the general public, as it may only be relevant to certain audiences or require access to specific data. Therefore, a score of 80 is assigned, indicating that the claim may be check-worthy but would require further context or clarification to determine its full significance."
29939,1,95,"But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy.",This sentence contains a factual claim about Donald Trump being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in 1973.

8937,1,50,"And we used - yes, we used - the Senate Budget Committee's projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5% - which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated.","The sentence mentions the Senate Budget Committee's projections for inflation rate, which is a factual claim. However, the sentence also contains the speaker's opinion that 'our plan' can eliminate the inflation rate of 7.5%. Since the opinion is subjective and not publicly verifiable, the score is reduced."
13798,1,30,"The only thing I would say about that is, I think that on the economy, Mr. Bush said for a long time there was no recession, and then said it would be better to do nothing than to have a compromise effort with the Congress.","This sentence contains two factual claims about Mr. Bush's statements regarding the economy, but they are not directly related to a specific fact or statistic that can be easily fact-checked using publicly available information. The sentence also includes an opinion ('it would be better to do nothing than to have a compromise effort with the Congress') which makes it less check-worthy."
1881,1,50,And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about a proposed tax rate change, but it is not clear whether this change would be significant to the general public or not. A tax rate change for small businesses may not be widely known or relevant to most people, and the impact on businesses and individuals would depend on various factors. Therefore, a score of 50 seems appropriate."
8576,1,50,"And as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago.","This sentence does not contain a clear factual claim that can be checked using publicly available information. It only mentions the United States being further ahead, but it does not specify in what area or by how much. Therefore, it is considered non-checkworthy."
19871,1,0,"It costs about $27,000 to pay people to volunteer.",This sentence is non check-worthy as it contains a statement that is not factual and not salient to the general public. The cost of paying people to volunteer is not a factual claim and is subjective in nature.

25924,1,60,"When I asked Yassir Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu to come to Washington and got them together and they talked alone for three hours, I was convinced that they had to have a chance to make that peace.","This sentence contains a factual claim about Yassir Arafat, Prime Minister Netanyahu, and a meeting in Washington D.C. However, the claim is not directly checkable as there is no specific date or location mentioned. Additionally, the sentence includes an opinionated statement about the importance of the meeting for making peace, which lowers the check-worthiness score."
12641,1,100,There isn't a single American diplomatic representative in any of those six.,"The sentence contains a factual claim about the absence of American diplomats in six specific locations, which is check-worthy."
27057,1,0,"What we've done is organize the international community, saying Assad has to go.","This sentence contains a statement about what 'we' have done, which is subjective and not factual. It also does not contain any specific claims about Assad or the international community that can be fact-checked using publicly available information."
12938,1,50,"The first position you took, when this matter first came up, was that we should draw the line and commit ourselves, as a matter of principle, to defend these islands.","This sentence contains a claim about a past position taken by an unspecified speaker, but it does not provide enough context or information to fact-check the claim definitively. It is possible that the speaker is a public figure, but without further information, it is difficult to determine the facts of the situation. Additionally, the sentence does not contain any specific facts or statistics that could be checked. Therefore, I assign a score of 50, indicating that the sentence is somewhat check-worthy but may require additional context or information to be fully fact-checked."
8609,1,60,"In August of 1960, when we tried to get it again, but this time for medical care, we received the support of one Republican in the Senate on this occasion.","This sentence contains a factual claim about a specific event in history (trying to get something in August 1960 and receiving support from one Republican senator). However, without more context, it is unclear who 'we' are and what 'it' refers to, which reduces the claim's saliency to the general public. Therefore, the check-worthiness score is relatively low."
16617,1,50,But it was a tremendous shift from administrative jobs into the delivery of services.,"This sentence contains a claim about a shift from administrative jobs to service delivery, which is factual and potentially salient to the general public. However, without more context or specific numbers, it is difficult to assign a high check-worthiness score. A score of 50 seems reasonable."
27580,1,80,"I see our trade deficit with China, larger than it's -- growing larger every year, as a matter of fact.","This sentence contains a factual claim about the growing trade deficit with China, which is a matter of public interest and can be fact-checked using publicly available data from sources such as the US Census Bureau or the US International Trade Commission."

The first claim is factual and can be checked by researching the properties of bio-degradable plastics. The second claim is also factual and can be checked by finding information about the Vice President's involvement in this type of plastic. However, the sentence does not provide enough context or specific details to make a definitive fact-check. Therefore, the score is set to 60, indicating that the sentence is somewhat check-worthy."
28297,1,100,More than 90% of America's children go to public schools.,"This statement is factual and salient to the general public. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, 51% of children in the United States were enrolled in private schools during the 2019-2020 school year. However, since the statement claims that'more than 90%' of children go to public schools, it is an overestimation of the actual percentage. Therefore, the statement is not exactly correct, but it is still factual within a certain range. The discrepancy between the statement and the actual percentage is not significant enough to lower the check-worthiness score significantly."
3753,1,80,Some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.,"This statement implies a factual claim about the transfer of funds to terrorist organizations, which is a matter of public interest and concern. However, it is important to note that the claim requires further investigation and fact-checking to determine the specific organizations involved, the amount of money, and the source of the funds. Therefore, the score is set at 80 to reflect the potential factual significance of the claim while acknowledging the need for further investigation."
33486,1,95,"We have 17 -- 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election.",This sentence contains a factual claim about the conclusion of 17 intelligence agencies regarding the origin of cyberattacks targeting US elections. The number of intelligence agencies involved and their conclusion is publicly available information.
29282,1,0,"For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.",This sentence is non-checkworthy as it contains no factual claims and is more of a rhetorical statement expressing an opinion about someone's behavior over time.
23138,1,50,"First, he says he's for medical liability reform, particularly for OB/GYNs.","This statement contains a claim about a political stance (medical liability reform for OB/GYNs) taken by a person. While it is factual that the person expressed support for this issue, the claim is not particularly salient to the general public as it is a specific policy position. Therefore, it is given a moderate check-worthiness score of 50."
15603,1,80,He has raised taxes several times.,"This statement is checkworthy because it contains a factual claim about a specific action taken by an individual (raising taxes) which is a matter of public record. The number of times the taxes were raised is not explicitly stated, but it is a quantifiable fact that can be verified through publicly available information such as government records or news articles."
2872,1,50,"After he fired James Schlesinger, the political heat got so great that he added back about $3 billion.","This sentence contains a factual claim about Gerald Ford firing James Schlesinger and the political heat that followed. However, the claim about Ford adding back about $3 billion is not specific enough to be fact-checked using publicly available information. A more precise claim, such as 'In what year did Gerald Ford add back $3 billion to the budget after firing James Schlesinger?' would be checkworthy."
1892,1,95,"The approach that Governor Romney's talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.","This sentence contains several factual claims that are checkworthy: 1) Governor Romney's approach is the same as in 2001 and 2003, 2) We had the slowest job growth in 50 years, 3) We ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and 4) It culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. These claims can be fact-checked using publicly available information such as economic data and historical records."

7033,1,85,Twenty percent of the upper-income people pay about 80 percent of the taxes in America today because of how we structured the tax cuts.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about the distribution of tax burden in America. The claim can be fact-checked using publicly available data from the IRS or other reputable sources. However, the exact percentage may vary slightly depending on the source and the time period considered. Therefore, the score is not 100 but rather 85 to account for potential variations in the data."
9226,1,50,That's what's been squeezing middle class families.,"This sentence implies a factual claim about what is squeezing middle class families, but it does not provide any specific information about what that squeezing factor is. To fact-check this claim, we would need more context or details about what is specifically squeezing middle class families. Without this information, it is difficult to assign a high check-worthiness score."
23044,1,100,"And, you know, in 2006 seniors are going to get prescription drug coverage for the first time in Medicare.","This statement is factual and salient to the general public as it refers to a specific change in Medicare policy that occurred in 2006, which is a well-known fact."
26019,1,0,"After this year is over, we'll resolve it just as we did with Social Security in `83.",This sentence does not contain any factual claims that are checkworthy. It only contains a reference to a past event (Social Security in `83') and a prediction for the future ('we'll resolve it'). These types of statements are not checkworthy as they do not provide any new or verifiable information for the general public.
13278,1,0,He didn't take that position on Tibet.,"This sentence does not contain any factual claims that are checkworthy. It only states that someone 'didn't take that position', which is an opinion and not a fact."
21877,1,100,"He's got to raise 20,000 bucks a week to have enough money to run.",This sentence contains a clear factual claim about a specific fundraising requirement for an individual to run for office. The amount of money needed per week is a quantifiable figure that can be fact-checked using publicly available information.
7654,1,30,That of course was rejected as was the government contracts provision by the special session of the Congress to - in which Mr. Kennedy was quite active.,"This sentence mentions that 'the government contracts provision was rejected' by Congress during a special session. While it is a factual statement, it is not clear which specific government contracts provision is being referred to, and without this information, it would be difficult to fact-check the claim. Additionally, the sentence also mentions that 'Mr. Kennedy was quite active' during the special session, which is an opinionated statement and not factual."
23177,1,0,We passed it out of the House of Representatives.,This sentence is non-checkworthy as it only describes an action that occurred in the past and is not factual or salient to the general public.
8605,1,50,The Kerr bill provided assistance to all those who were not on Social Security.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about the Kerr bill, but it is not clear who exactly the bill provided assistance to beyond those not on Social Security. More information is needed to determine the full scope of the bill's assistance and make a more definitive fact-checking assessment."
8733,1,30,"possibility for oil of the continental shelf around the United States; when you stop to think that the government has taken over 100 million acres of land out of circulation in Alaska, alone, that is believed by geologists to contain much in the line of minerals and energy sources, then I think it is the Government, and the Government with its own restrictions and regulations, that is creating the energy crisis.","The sentence contains several claims that are not factual or not directly verifiable. The first claim is that the government has taken over 100 million acres of land in Alaska, which is a factual claim but it is not clear where the number comes from or if it is up-to-date. The second claim is that this land contains'much in the line of minerals and energy sources', which is also a factual claim but it is not clear who the geologists are or what their findings are. The third claim is that the government is creating the energy crisis, which is an opinionated statement and not directly verifiable. Therefore, the overall score is 30, as the sentence contains several factual claims but they are not directly verifiable or lack sufficient context."
3704,1,85,Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate.,"This statement is checkworthy because it contains a factual claim about Senator Obama's voting record in the US Senate. The claim can be fact-checked using publicly available information such as voting records and political ideology scores. However, it is important to note that the term'most liberal' is subjective and can be interpreted differently, so the factual aspect of the claim is that Senator Obama has a liberal voting record in the US Senate, not necessarily the most liberal one."
12606,1,80,And yet last year we gave them less than five percent of all the technical assistance funds that we distributed around the world.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about the percentage of technical assistance funds given to a certain entity last year. However, the specific entity and the total amount of funds distributed around the world are not mentioned, so the score is not 100. A fact-checker would need to identify the entity and the total amount to determine the exact percentage and verify its accuracy."
26092,1,80,$500 per child under 18.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about a monetary amount, which is a common type of check-worthy claim. The claim is also salient to the general public as it relates to financial matters and child-related expenses. However, the sentence does not specify the source or context of the claim, which could impact its accuracy. Therefore, the score is not perfect, but still relatively high."
19527,1,0,Now I understand it's been extended 'til some time next year.,"This sentence is non-checkworthy as it only contains a statement about an extension of something, which is a trivial factual claim. There is no clear claim about a specific date or duration that can be fact-checked using publicly available information. Therefore, the score would be 0 with the reasoning that the sentence is not check-worthy."
25088,1,85,"In Lebanon, this President exercised American power, all right, but the management of it was such that our marines were killed, we had to leave in humiliation, the Soviet Union became stronger, terrorists became emboldened.","This sentence contains several factual claims that are relevant to the general public: Lebanon had a President who exercised American power, American marines were killed, the US had to leave in humiliation, the Soviet Union became stronger, and terrorists became emboldened.

18815,1,50,We're the leading donor in the world to help the suffering people there.,"This sentence contains a claim about being the 'leading donor in the world', but without specifying to which cause or organization, or providing any quantifiable data, it is difficult to fact-check this claim with publicly available information."
7283,1,50,And that's why early in my administration I called the attorney general and the U. S. attorneys and said: Put together a task force all around the country to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about the speaker (President Trump) calling the attorney general and U.S. attorneys during his administration to put together a task force. However, it does not provide enough information to fact-check the claim thoroughly, such as the exact date or location of the call. Additionally, the sentence does not mention any specific crimes or statistics related to gun crimes, which would make the claim more check-worthy."
30119,1,50,"Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.","This sentence expresses a concern about the fairness of a financial arrangement between two parties (the US and another country). While it contains a factual claim about a treaty and contract, the sentence is primarily opinionated and does not provide enough specific information to fact-check. Therefore, it receives a moderate check-worthiness score."

The claim can be fact-checked using publicly available data from sources such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or the World Bank.

29313,1,0,But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...,"This sentence is non check-worthy as it contains no factual claims and is primarily composed of subjective statements and questions.

34346,1,50,He was criticizing President Reagan.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about a historical event, but it is not check-worthy because it is not salient to the general public and does not provide any specific information about the criticism or the context in which it occurred.

However, it is not clear from the sentence whether the claim is still accurate today or not. To fact-check this claim, one would need to find reliable sources that provide current real interest rates and compare them to historical rates. Additionally, the sentence mentions 'huge deficits' which also requires fact-checking. Therefore, the score is 80 as the claim is factual but not fully checkable from the given sentence alone."
7778,1,30,"The program that was put forward this summer, after we broke off the sugar quota with Cuba, really was done because we wanted to get through the O.A.S.","This sentence contains a factual claim about the program being put forward after breaking off the sugar quota with Cuba.

However, it also includes the opinion that the Administration opposed it.

It is salient to the general public as it touches on employment statistics. However, the sentence also contains an opinionated statement about the effectiveness of giving statutory authority to the Committee on Government Contracts for making progress in this area. While this statement may be widely held, it is still subjective and could vary depending on individual perspectives.

However, it also includes imprecise language such as 'what, about a million-two a piece' and 'hit some radar, that repaired in a couple, three days'.

29482,1,80,Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.,"This statement implies a factual claim about the effectiveness of tax cuts on the wealthy. It can be fact-checked by examining economic data and studies on the topic. However, it is important to note that the definition of 'wealthy' and the time frame for evaluating the effectiveness of the tax cuts can vary, which may affect the outcome of the fact-check.

The sentence mentions the return of $700 billion, the markets recovering, and the government making a profit during the Great Depression.

20303,1,20,The governor has described Medicare as a government HMO.,"This statement is factual but it is not clear what the governor meant by 'described Medicare as a government HMO'.

The number of new schools (3,000) and the source of funding (teachers, parents, and business people) are quantifiable claims that could be fact-checked.

These claims can be fact-checked using publicly available information from government reports and studies. However, the sentence is not a definitive statement as it is an opinionated suggestion.

Additionally, the sentence implies that no unqualified individuals received loans, which is also a factual claim that would need to be fact-checked. Therefore, while the sentence contains several factual claims, the lack of specificity and the need for multiple fact-checks lowers its check-worthiness score."

The claim is salient to the general public as it relates to international relations and diplomacy.

However, the sentence also implies that 'upper-income individuals' are taking advantage of 'loopholes and deductions' to avoid paying for these expenses, which may require additional research and context to fact-check accurately.

While this is a factual claim, it is not directly checkable with publicly available information as the claim is not specific enough to allow for a definitive fact-check. The sentence mentions 'the record of gun control' in'some cities or another or in some states,' which is too broad to fact-check effectively. Additionally, the sentence also mentions 'the use of that gun in the committing of a crime,' which is another complex claim that would require extensive research to fact-check definitively. Therefore, the claim is only partially check-worthy and is given a score of 60."
14325,1,0,"We told him that we wouldn't get involved with his border dispute, and we've never revealed those papers that were given to Ambassador Glaspie on July the 25th.","This sentence does not contain any factual claims that are checkworthy.

6669,1,80,This president didn't stand up for Boeing when Airbus was violating international rules and subsidies.,"This sentence contains a factual claim about a president's actions towards Boeing and Airbus, which is a matter of public interest. However, it requires further investigation to determine which president is being referred to and the specific international rules and subsidies involved. Therefore, the score is set at 80 to reflect the need for fact-checking."
7768,1,100,"Thirdly, in 1952, there were only seven votes in favor of the admission of Red China into the United Nations.",This statement is factual and salient to the general public as it refers to a specific historical event with a factual claim about the number of votes.

817,1,80,A report on international terrorism chaired by the Vice President was released and made some very specific recommendations about how to deal with terrorism.,This sentence contains a factual claim about the release of a report on international terrorism chaired by the Vice President.

However, the sentence does not specify who is leaving or where they are going, which limits the ability to fact-check the claim definitively using publicly available information. Therefore, the check-worthiness score is relatively high but not maximum."
21304,1,80,"We've shipped millions of jobs overseas and we have a strange situation because we have a process in Washington where after you've served for a while you cash in, become a foreign lobbyist, make $30,000 a month, then take a leave, work on presidential campaigns, make sure you've got good contacts and then go back out.","This sentence contains several factual claims: 'We've shipped millions of jobs overseas' and 'after you've served for a while you cash in, become a foreign lobbyist, make $30,000 a month'. These claims can be fact-checked using publicly available data from organizations such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the US Census Bureau. The sentence also mentions 'a process in Washington' and'make sure you've got good contacts', which are more subjective and less easily fact-checked, but do not detract significantly from the overall factual nature of the sentence. Therefore, the sentence is checkworthy with a score of 80."
8667,1,80,"Even though we've seen some hopeful signs, perhaps, in the flash report on the third quarter, that perhaps the economy is coming out of the recession, we've also seen the rise in the rate of the prime; we have seen mortgage rates back up again, a sure sign of inflation in the housing industry.","The sentence contains factual claims about the economy, the third quarter flash report, and mortgage rates. These claims can be fact-checked using publicly available information.

These interpretations do not affect the fact-checking process but reduce the sentence's overall check-worthiness score."

12014,1,0,There's a lot of talk about trigger locks being on guns sold in the future.,"This sentence expresses a general trend or topic of conversation, but it does not contain any specific factual claims that can be checked. It is more of a statement about what people are discussing, rather than a factual claim itself."
17800,1,80,"Why the deficits are so much of a problem for him now, but that in 1976, when the deficit was $52 billion and everyone was panicking about that, he said, no, that he thought it ought to be bigger, because a bigger deficit would stimulate the economy and would help do away with unemployment.","This sentence contains a factual claim about the deficits in 1976 and 2023, and the statement about what Nixon said in 1976 is also factual. However, it is not clear if the statement about Nixon's perspective on deficits in 1976 is widely known or salient to the general public, so the score is not 100."
17287,1,0,"When the Republican platform says that from here on out, we're going to have a religious test for judges before they're selected for the Federal court, and then Jerry Falwell announces that that means they get at least two Justices of the Supreme Court, I think that's an abuse of faith in our country.",This sentence contains an opinionated statement ('that's an abuse of faith in our country') and does not contain any factual claims that are checkworthy.

6583,1,85,"They just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days: $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from China.","This sentence contains factual claims about the passing of a legislation expansion and the amount of giveaways involved. The industries mentioned, oil and gas and ceiling fan importers from China, are publicly known and can be fact-checked using publicly available information."
11652,1,80,"In the Balkans we have allies, NATO, ready, willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden.","This statement implies a factual claim about the presence and readiness of NATO forces in the Balkans. However, it is not a specific claim about the number of troops or the exact locations, which makes it a somewhat vague claim.

This information is publicly available and can be fact-checked through various sources such as news articles and government reports. However, the sentence also includes the opinion that it's 'far better' for the US to concentrate aid elsewhere instead of Laos, which is subjective and not factual. Therefore, the score is not 100 as there is a non-fact component in the sentence."
18142,1,50,More in July than June.,"This sentence contains a comparative claim, but it is not clear what is being compared. It could be referring to any number of things, such as temperature, rainfall, or political events. Without more context, it is difficult to determine if this claim is factual and salient to the general public. Therefore, it is given a medium check-worthiness score of 50."
79,1,50,"You know, we have five percent of the world's population in this country.","This statement is factual, but it is not clear which country is being referred to, making it difficult to fact-check without additional context. Therefore, the check-worthiness score is moderate."
15072,1,80,"In countries like Libya or Iraq, we have even alienated some of our closest trade partners because we have insisted upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries.","This sentence contains factual claims about countries (Libya and Iraq) and their nuclear weapons programs. However, it also includes the subjective claim 'we have even alienated some of our closest trade partners' which may require additional research to fact-check accurately.

However, it is important to note that the claim may require further fact-checking to determine its accuracy and the specific context in which it applies. The sentence also mentions various welfare programs, which may have different eligibility requirements and tax implications in different jurisdictions. Therefore, a more thorough fact-check would be necessary to determine the exact scope and accuracy of the claim."
13251,1,50,"Now, as a result of our taking the strong stand that we did, the civil war there was ended; and today, at least in the south of Indochina, the Communists have moved out and we do have a strong, free bastion there.","This sentence contains a claim about the ending of the civil war in Indochina and the Communists moving out, but it lacks specificity and publicly available information to fact-check these claims.

33661,1,80,"... the fact is, he's going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration.","This statement contains a factual claim about the proposed tax cuts being larger than those under the Bush administration. However, it is not clear from the sentence alone whether the claim is true or false, and additional research would be needed to determine the exact size of the proposed tax cuts and those under the Bush administration.

There are not 30 nations involved in Iraq and 40 nations involved in Afghanistan. According to the United Nations, there are 193 member states as of 2021. It is possible that the speaker meant to say that there are coalition members from 30 or 40 countries involved in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, but without additional context, it is impossible to fact-check this claim."
12609,1,100,There isn't one country in the Middle East that now endorses the Eisenhower Doctrine.,"The Eisenhower Doctrine was a policy statement issued by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower on January 5, 1957, in which he declared that the United States would consider any intervention in the Middle East by another outside power to be a dangerous threat to its own security and would therefore consider taking action to protect its interests in the region.

The sentence mentions a potential 'economy that would be generated from a restraint on spending,' a 'tax reduction primarily for the middle-income people,' and'sacrifices for peace and prosperity in the next four years.' However, without more context or specific information, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of these claims. Additionally, the sentence contains subjective language such as 'I think the American people would be willing to make those sacrifices,' which further reduces its check-worthiness score."

Additionally, the sentence does not specify who exactly 'hated' Rabin, which could be an important detail for fact-checking purposes. Therefore, the score is not 100, but rather 85, as there is some level of uncertainty and potential for further fact-checking."
