""If we assume the ah - uh - a rate of growth of our economy, equivalent to what it was during President Johnson, President Kennedy, even before the - the - the - uh wa uh - Vietnese- namese War""   This claim refers to the economic growth rate during the presidencies of Johnson and Kennedy, and before the Vietnam War. While this is a factual claim, it is not clear what the exact growth rates were during these periods, and whether the speaker intends to compare them to a specific benchmark. Additionally, the reference to the ""Vietnamese-namese War"" is ambiguous, as it could refer to the Vietnam War or the Vietnam War of 1954-1955. Without more context, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of this claim. Score: 30, Reasoning: Ambiguous and incomplete.2. ""and if we assume that at the end of the four-year period we"

The third claim, 'Nuclear power creates hundreds of thousands of jobs,' is a factual claim that can be checked. However, the score is not 100 because the sentence does not provide enough context or specificity for a thorough fact-check.

These claims can be verified by checking diplomatic records and news articles.

However, the first claim is a promise made by a political figure, which is subjective and opinion-centered. The second claim, 'I'm giving you health care', is also a promise and its factuality depends on the implementation of the policy. Therefore, the score is set at 50, as both claims are not objectively verifiable at this time."
1940,1,The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth.,50,"This sentence contains a claim about the effect of tax increases on economic growth, which is a factual matter. However, the claim is subjective in the sense that it expresses a negative view of the outcome.

The claim is salient to the general public as it relates to a significant policy change that affected a large number of people.

Therefore, the score is not 100 but rather 80."

However, it is not clear if the number is up-to-date or an approximation. Additionally, the sentence uses the informal pronoun 'we' which may create confusion about who the speaker is referring to.

17568,1,They hit middle- and moderate-income Americans and leave wealthy Americans largely untouched.,90," This sentence is checkworthy because it contains a factual claim about who is affected by a certain policy or event. The claim is that middle- and moderate-income Americans are hit, while wealthy Americans are largely untouched. This is a clear distinction between different income groups and has implications for public understanding of economic issues.

The reasoning is that the sentence contains a factual claim about income groups and their relationship to a policy or event, which is salient to the general public."

26687,1,"By far, the largest number in American history -- not just the big ones you read about, but a lot of smaller ones.",70,"The reasoning behind this score is that the sentence contains a claim about the largest number in American history, which is a factual claim that is likely to be of interest to the general public. However, the sentence also mentions ""not just the big ones you read about, and a lot of smaller ones,"" which introduces some ambiguity and subjectivity to the claim. Therefore, I would assign a score of 70 to this sentence.

The mention of 'virtually every year' and 'one or two' suggests that there may be exceptions to the rule, which could make the claim less salient to the general public. Without more context or specific numbers, it is difficult to determine the factual accuracy of the claim."
13641,1,My plan balances the budget within 6 years.,50,"This statement is checkworthy because it contains a factual claim about balancing the budget within a specific time frame.

However, it does not provide any specific information about what this increase refers to. Without more context, it is difficult to determine if this claim is salient to the general public. Therefore, I would give this sentence a low check-worthiness score, perhaps around 20. The reasoning is that while the claim is factual, it lacks sufficient context to be of significant public interest."

The reasoning behind this is that the sentence does not contain any new or significant factual claim that can be verified or checked. The mention of the year 1993 is a trivial factual claim that does not add any new or significant information to the sentence. Therefore, the score would be 0."

These claims are salient to the general public as they involve significant amounts of money and government spending. However, the sentence also implies the existence of 'loopholes and deductions' that upper-income individuals are taking advantage of, which may require further fact-checking to determine their factual basis and extent.

Therefore, this claim contributes significantly to the check-worthiness of the sentence.2) The claim that Cuba has also moved within the Soviet sphere of influence is also factual and salient to the general public, as it relates to international relations and geopolitical alignments. Therefore, this claim also contributes significantly to the check-worthiness of the sentence.3) The claim that both Guinea, Ghana, and Cuba have moved within the Soviet sphere of influence in foreign policy is a restatement of the first two claims, and does not add new fact"

Thus, the score is set at 30, reflecting the presence of a factual claim but the predominance of opinion-based statements."
9214,1,And we would have lost a million jobs.,0,"This sentence is non check-worthy. The claim of losing a million jobs is a factual claim, but it is not salient to the general public.
