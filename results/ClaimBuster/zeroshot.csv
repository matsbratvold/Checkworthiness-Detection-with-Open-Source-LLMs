Specifically, it mentions that ""every middle-income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains."" This is a significant change in tax policy that would affect many people, and it is the type of information that fact-checking organizations would be interested in verifying.

The assumed rate of economic growth during the presidencies of Johnson and Kennedy is a factual claim that can be checked by looking up historical economic data.

The claim is attributed to a leading member of the House Budget Committee, adding credibility to the statement. However, the sentence does not provide a specific source or citation for this claim, which reduces its check-worthiness score."
31932,1,And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing.,50,"This sentence is non-checkworthy as it contains a statement about what'many' people have said, which is subjective and difficult to fact-check definitively.

However, the sentence also mentions ""not just the big ones you read about, and a lot of smaller ones,"" which introduces some subjectivity and ambiguity to the claim. Therefore, I would assign a score of 70 to this sentence. The reasoning is that the factual claim about the largest number in American history is the primary focus of the sentence, and it is likely to be of significant interest to the general public.

Here's a breakdown of the claims and my reasoning for each:1.

However, it would be important to verify the inflation rates from reliable sources to ensure accuracy.3. ""highest deficits in history"" - This claim may be factual, but it would need to be verified using reliable sources, such as the U.S. Department of the Treasury or the Congressional Budget Office.4. ""becoming increasingly difficult for a family to put a child through college or to own a home"" - This claim seems subjective and opinion-centered, as it relies on the speaker's interpretation of"

It could be a factual claim about an increase in a certain quantity, or it could be a subjective statement. Without more context, it's not possible to give a definitive check-worthiness score. However, based on the given sentence alone, I would assign it a low check-worthiness score of around 10, as it does not contain any clear factual claims that are salient to the general public.

This information is relevant to the public as it touches on the functioning of a major law enforcement agency in the United States. However, the sentence does not provide specific details about the old law or the timeframe in which it was in effect, which could limit the scope of the fact-checking investigation. Therefore, the score is not 100, but rather 80, reflecting the factual nature of the claim but also acknowledging the need for further investigation to determine the exact nature of the old law and its impact on FBI intelligence sharing."
5891,1,"Well, again, while you were on the board of the Woods Foundation, you and Mr. Ayers, together, you sent $230,000 to ACORN.",85,"This sentence contains a factual claim about a monetary transaction between two individuals and an organization.

3564,1,"And he's also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn't the case with me.",30,"The reasoning behind this score is that the sentence contains a factual claim about lobbyists and special interests introducing requests, but it is not a widely known or significant fact, and the sentence also mentions the speaker's personal experience which is subjective and not generally applicable. Therefore, I would give this sentence a score of around 30. The factual claim about lobbyists and special interests is true and relevant, but the sentence as a whole is not highly check-worthy due to the inclusion of subjective and non-generalizable elements."
1426,1,We had an 18 percent increase in housing starts.,85,"This sentence contains a factual claim about an increase in housing starts, which is a significant economic indicator. The percentage figure makes the claim more precise and quantifiable, increasing its check-worthiness."
16803,1,There's only been uh - a net savings of $4 billion.,10,"This sentence is not check-worthy as it contains a factual claim, but it is not salient to the general public. The amount of $4 billion is not a significant figure in the grand scheme of things, and it does not touch on any important or widely-known information. Therefore, the score would be low, perhaps around 10 or below. The reasoning is that the claim is factual but not salient."

1387,1,Uh - I think the Burger Court has confirmed that basic and very controversial decision of the Warren Court.,30,"Based on the given context, the sentence appears to be discussing a legal decision made by the Burger Court in relation to a previous decision made by the Warren Court. The sentence does not contain any subjective or opinion-centered statements, and it is factual in nature. However, it does not provide any specific information about the legal decision in question, so it is not particularly salient to the general public. Therefore, I would assign a relatively low check-worthiness score to this sentence, perhaps around 30. The reasoning is that while the sentence is factual and discusses a legal decision, it does not provide enough information to be of significant interest or importance to the general public."
33386,1,"I voted for border security, and there are...",0," This sentence is non check-worthy as it contains a subjective statement (""I voted for"") and a vague claim (""there are"") without specifying what exactly ""border security"" refers to or what ""there are"" refers to.

However, it is important to note that the sentence does not provide any specific date or context, which could limit its check-worthiness score. Additionally, the sentence does not contain any subjective or opinion-centered statements, making it a factual claim."

The sentence refers to a specific policy decision made by a political figure in the past, which is not a fact that can be easily verified or checked. Therefore, the score would be 0 and the reasoning would be ""The sentence contains a subjective and opinion-centered statement about a specific historical event and personal experience, rather than a factual claim that is salient to the general public."""
7195,1,"I don't know how you can govern in this country when you look at New York City and you see that 50 percent of the black males there are unemployed, when you see 40 percent of Hispanic children -- of black children in some cities -- dropping out of high school.",85,This sentence contains factual claims about unemployment rates among black males in New York City and high school dropout rates among black and Hispanic children in some cities.

13431,1,The Democratic platform and others say five per cent.,0,"This sentence is non check-worthy as it is stating a claim from a specific platform without providing any factual evidence or context to support the claim. The claim is also subjective as it depends on the interpretation of the Democratic platform. Therefore, the score would be 0 with the reasoning that the sentence is non check-worthy due to its subjective nature and lack of factual evidence."

24537,1,"Thirty years ago, there were three policemen for every crime.",85,"This sentence contains a factual claim about the ratio of policemen to crimes thirty years ago, which is a matter of public interest and can be verified through historical data."

9703,1,"President Obama was right, he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years.",90," The sentence is checkworthy.

The reasoning behind this assessment is that the sentence contains a factual claim about the size of budget deficits during the Bush years, which is a matter of public record and significant economic information. Therefore, the score would be high, perhaps around 90 or 100, depending on the specific source of the claim and the level of detail provided. The reasoning is that the sentence contains a factual claim about a past economic condition that is both significant and verifiable."
3329,1,Just on Monday of this week I signed a tax bill that included an amendment that would prevent companies in the United States from taking a tax deduction if they have in any way whatsoever cooperated with the Arab boycott.,85,"This sentence contains a factual claim about the signing of a tax bill and an amendment related to the Arab boycott. The claim is salient to the general public as it involves government policy and international relations. However, the sentence does not provide specific details about the tax bill or the amendment, which could limit the fact-checking scope. Additionally, the sentence mentions 'this week', which may require some fact-checking effort to determine the exact date.

Therefore, it is likely to be of interest to the general public and should be considered check-worthy. The score I would give this sentence is 85. The reasoning is that while the claim is factual and salient, it is not a particularly new or groundbreaking claim, so it may not generate as much interest or urgency as a more recent or unexpected fact. Additionally, the sentence does not provide any specific statistics or data points, which could increase its check-worthiness score."
26300,1,"When they had a 250 billion dollar tax scheme, that is half the size of this one.",0,"This sentence is non-checkworthy as it contains a comparison of two tax schemes without providing any factual information about their specifics.

16781,1,I think it's interesting to point out that uh - in the uh - two years that I've been president I've vetoed fifty-six bills.,,"This sentence is non-checkworthy as it contains a subjective statement (""I think it's interesting"") and a statement about the number of bills vetoed by the speaker, which is a factual claim but not salient to the general public. The reasoning behind this score is that the sentence does not provide enough context or importance to warrant fact-checking by a third party."
13133,1,"Admiral Yarnell, the commander of the Asiatic fleet, has said that these islands are not worth the bones of a single American.",80,"This statement is factual as it is a quote from Admiral Yarnell, and it is salient to the historical context of the Philippine-American War.

However, it does not provide any specific information about the cause of these surpluses or the context in which they have arisen. Therefore, it may be difficult to determine the accuracy of this claim without additional context.Additionally, the sentence contains the phrase ""it does not work,"" which implies a subjective opinion about the effectiveness of a particular policy. This further complicates the check-worthiness assessment, as opinions are not typically considered factual claims.Taking these considerations into account, I would assign a relatively low check-worthiness score to this sentence, perhaps around 30. The reasoning for this score is that while the sentence does contain a factual claim about the existence and value of agricultural surpluses, the lack of specific context and the inclusion of a subjective opinion make it difficult to determine the accuracy of the claim without further investigation.{""score"": 30, ""reasoning"": ""The sentence contains a factual claim about the existence and value of agricultural surplices, but the lack of specific context and the inclusion of a subjective opinion make it difficult to determine the"

The second claim, that 'the Federal Government has pre-empted too many of the tax sources', is an opinion. The third claim, that 'the cities' have a problem, is a vague statement that does not provide enough context or factual information to determine its check-worthiness."

10854,1,"I traveled all over the world looking at the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, Joe Lieberman and I.",10,"This sentence contains factual claims about the travel history of Joe Lieberman and the speaker, but it is not salient to the general public as it is a specific anecdote."

This information is likely to be of interest to the general public as it relates to employment and retirement savings.

For instance, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the United States had the largest nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the world in 2020. However, other countries like China, when measured by purchasing power parity (PPP), have a larger economy. Therefore, the claim is factual but context-dependent.2. The second claim, ""the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it,"" is also factual but requires clarification. The term ""it"" is ambiguous and could refer to various things.

The score I would assign to this sentence is around 80. The reasoning behind this score is that while the sentence does contain a factual claim, it is somewhat vague and incomplete, and could benefit from additional context or specificity to make it more definitively checkworthy. For example, it would be helpful to know exactly what resource is being referred to (oil, gas, minerals, etc.) and how much production is being claimed to have occurred or not occurred. Without this information, the claim is somewhat ambiguous and could be subject to interpretation. Therefore, a score of 80 seems appropriate, as the sentence does contain a factual claim of interest to the public, but could benefit from additional context or specificity to make it more definitively checkworthy."

These claims can be verified by checking official labor statistics, such as those from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The second claim can be checked by calculating the average annual job growth rate during the stated Democratic administration and comparing it to the average annual job growth rate during Republican administrations since the 1920s.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regularly publishes data on industrial pollution, and Texas often ranks high due to its large industrial sector and lax regulations.

These claims are salient to the general public as they relate to a significant military event.

However, it is important to note that the sentence does not specify which cuts are being referred to or when they were promised. Additionally, the sentence uses the term ""doubled,"" which could be interpreted in different ways (e.g., the cuts were originally X and they were increased to 2X, or the cuts were originally X and they were increased to Y which is more than X).Based on the information provided, it is difficult to assign a definitive check-worthiness score to this sentence without additional context. However, we can provide a reasoning for a potential score.If we assume that the sentence is referring to specific budget cuts that were promised by the president and that the term ""doubled"" means that the cuts were increased by a factor of two, then the sentence could be considered check-worthy with a score of around 70. This is because the sentence contains a factual claim about the president not making the promised cuts and increasing them by a factor of two, which is salient information to the general public.However, if we interpret the sentence in a different way ("

16024,1,I voted against that at the National Governors Association.,0," This sentence is non check-worthy because it is an assertion of a specific action taken by the speaker in the past, which is not a fact that can be objectively verified by the general public. The reasoning behind this is that fact-checking requires verifiable information that can be independently confirmed, and this sentence does not meet that requirement. It is an example of an opinion or anecdote, which is not suitable for fact-checking. Therefore, the score would be 0."
2199,1,"AARP thinks that the -- the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years.",80,"The sentence contains a factual claim about the impact of savings on the Medicare trust fund, which is a matter of public interest and relevance.

The sentence assumes that the markets will recover, that taxpayers will get the money back, and that the government made a profit during the Great Depression by purchasing homes.

6574,1,President Bush has taken -- he's the only president in history to do this.,50,"This sentence contains a claim about President Bush being the only president in history to have done something. However, without specifying what that action is, it is difficult to fact-check the claim definitively.

18096,1,"As a matter of fact, this is a global effort.",50,This sentence is non-specific and does not contain any factual claims that can be verified or checked. It is a statement of opinion and does not provide any concrete information that can be fact-checked.
24847,1,"And in the process, as a result of that will and that decision and that toughness, we now have ancient enemies talking peace in the Middle East.",50,"This sentence is non-checkworthy as it contains subjective statements and is more focused on opinion rather than factual information. The sentence implies that the 'will and decision and toughness' led to peace talks, but it does not provide any concrete evidence or facts to support this claim.

However, it also mentions that the speakers ""got assailed by the Democrats in the election over that,"" which suggests that there may be subjective elements or opinions involved. Based on this information, I would assign a preliminary check-worthiness score of 60. The reasoning behind this score is that while the sentence does contain some potentially factual information, the inclusion of subjective elements (i.e., the mention of being assailed by the Democrats) makes it less clear-cut. Further investigation or context would be needed to determine the exact facts being claimed and their accuracy."
