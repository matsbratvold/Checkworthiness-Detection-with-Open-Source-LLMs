11497,,"One of the reasons why I think it's important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace to be able to say to the Saddam HusseinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s of the world or the Iranians, don't dare threaten our friends.",,,

32743,,How -- why would these people stay there?,,,

15490,,"We have much to do to step up that war, to double the number of drug enforcement agents, to fight both here and abroad, to work with our neighbors in this hemisphere.",,,
20238,,And let me give you an example of what I mean.,,,
22236,,"And the first word you need to say in every city and state, and just draw a line in the sand, is public schools exist for the benefit of the children.",,,
32268,,"If they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center.",,,
26589,,And people have to decide.,,,
6493,,But absolutely we can be secure in the long run.,,,
3902,,"The question is, was this wise?",,,
14197,,Both parties carry a huge blame for that on their shoulders.,,,
6883,,And I'm very proud of that.,,,
20491,,"As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life.",,,
22134,,So we need to stay right on top of that and constructively help them move toward democracy and capitalism.,,,
26642,,We took it out of politics.,,,
2743,,There's no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected you'll continue to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up.,,,
2173,,They're smart enough to know that's not a good trade.,,,
4202,,But we have to have a president who is clear that you don't deal with Russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul.,,,
6462,,The measurement is: Are we as safe as we ought to be?,,,
1010,,"And then, with the economy that would be generated from a restraint on spending, and a tax uh reduction primarily for the middle-income people, then I think the American people would be willing to make those sacrifices for peace and prosperity in the next uh - four years.",,,

24756,,"The Oregon plan made some good sense, but it's easy to dismiss the concerns of the disabled.",,,

2855,,We wanted to have majority rule with the full protection of the rights of the minority.,,,

24285,,And you can't convert from potato chips to airplanes in an emergency.,,,
16927,,I might go back to one other thing.,,,

32563,,She doesn't do anything about anything other than talk.,,,
16466,,We could uh - also uh - help our youths with some of the proposals that uh - would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time just like we give money to young people who are going to college.,,,
20083,,We just see the world in different ways.,,,

13909,,"Let's go to the center of the bull's-eye, the core problem.",,,
2759,,The president's reelected you'll see dramatic cuts to our military.,,,
24961,,"I have so many things there to respond to, I'm going to pick out something you said earlier.",,,
17036,,The individual worker in the plants throughout the United States should not be a small cog in a big machine.,,,
15968,,"The point is you've got to have a president who's prepared to do this and to begin right away and, preferably, a president who was a governor of a state that's had very, very successful experience at doing this.",,,
23899,,I think the American people should be the judge of that.,,,
17422,,That's where government should not be.,,,
21925,,"Well, I think the national debt affects everybody.",,,
15413,,"First of all, I'd like to thank the League of Women Voters for making this debate possible.",,,
7912,,"So under these circumstances, I, therefore, strongly urge and I will strongly hold, if I have the opportunity to urge or to hold - this position: that any summit conference would be gone into only after the most careful preparation and only after Mr. Khrushchev - after his disgraceful conduct at Paris, after his disgraceful conduct at the United Nations - gave some assurance that he really wanted to sit down and talk and to accomplish something and not just to make propaganda.",,,
16497,,"And from the a- analysis that I've made so far, it seems to me that that tax bill does uh - justify my signature and my approval.",,,
12960,,"I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again, to get our economy moving ahead, to set before the American people its goals, its unfinished business.",,,
22713,,And he talked about how optimistic he was and the country was about heading toward elections.,,,
20554,,I would appoint people that have a philosophy that I think would have it quite likely they would uphold Roe v. Wade.,,,
8295,,The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall.,,,
26175,,My view is we want to find jobs and opportunities and education.,,,
3602,,But let's go back to the original point.,,,
28112,,"The problem we have today is like the patient's bill of rights, particularly with health care, there's a lot of bickering in Washington, D.C.",,,
25205,,Should the President's age and stamina be an issue in the political campaign?,,,
26511,,"It was a big, big mistake.",,,
17570,,"As soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well, I'd like to see the total repeal of indexing.",,,
23573,,I think that's an example of a judge allowing personal opinion to enter into the decision-making process as opposed to a strict interpretation of the Constitution.,,,
22349,,You weren't impressed with the fact that he --,,,
266,,"Then he said, ""I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU.""",,,
8150,,"A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so.",,,
23571,,"Let me give you a couple of examples, I guess, of the kind of person I wouldn't pick.",,,
15440,,I ask the American people to join me in this partnership.,,,
27232,,But we also have to develop clean energy technologies that will allow us to cut our exports in half by 2020.,,,
6905,,Here's what I do: We take over Medicaid children from the states so that every child in America is covered.,,,
25775,,They were presidents at historic times.,,,
28404,,"If you want somebody who believes that we were better off eight years ago than we are now and that we ought to go back to the kind of policies that we had back then, emphasizing tax cuts mainly for the wealthy, here is your man.",,,
3790,,On a -- on the way that the Iraq War was conducted.,,,
26925,,And that's what we've done over the last four years.,,,
7470,,There was only four of us there.,,,
19976,,"So the question is, would you buy a used election promise from my opponent.",,,
27296,,... because I'm -- I'm so proud of the state that I had the chance to be governor of.,,,
15258,,"That is a misstatement, of course, of my position.",,,
18157,,"No, the way to win this is to be steadfast and resolved and to follow through on the plan that I've just outlined.",,,
171,,"We've had enough of that, ladies and gentlemen.",,,
1209,,But let's talk about what the Ford administration has done in the field of environment.,,,
25856,,"Somebody, you know, maybe your son, maybe your grandson, maybe somebody else.",,,
21261,,And a lot of times there are powerful forces that are against you.,,,
18844,,"Of course, we change tactics when need to, but we never change our beliefs, the strategic beliefs that are necessary to protect this country in the world.",,,
10931,,So here's what I would do.,,,
12973,,We can no longer afford to be second best.,,,
21748,,"And the way you get things done is bury yourselves in the room with one another, put together the best program, take it to the American people, use the electronic town hall, the kind of thing you're doing here tonight, build a consensus and then do it and then go on to the next one.",,,
20657,,The mission is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.,,,
25968,,"Then we took comments, as we always do, and there were tens of thousands of comments as to how we ought to do it.",,,
18210,,"But again, I repeat to my fellow citizens, the best way to protection is to stay on the offense.",,,
19624,,And I hope that will happen.,,,
15408,,And the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth.,,,
11402,,Strong relations in Europe is in our nation's interest.,,,
3994,,And we've got a choice.,,,
11331,,"Despite all that, I was able to go to the best schools on earth and I was able to succeed in a way that I could not have succeeded anywhere else in this country.",,,
12948,,I served it uh - in the war.,,,
1060,,"I believe that the opposite is true with President Ford's campaign, and uh - I hope that we can leave those issues in this next ten days about personalities and mistakes of the past - we've both made some mistakes - and talk about unemployment, inflation, housing, education, taxation, government organization, stripping away of secrecy, and the things that are crucial to the American people.",,,
23250,,Do you know what he presented us with?,,,
19834,,"Let me say first of all, I'm all for students having more choices.",,,
27085,,"We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria, making sure that the -- the insurgent there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed, are people who will be the responsible parties.",,,
8022,,It is a decision finally that the Nationalists should make and I believe that we should consult with them and attempt to work out a plan by which the line is drawn at the island of Formosa.,,,
652,,Because the Soviet change is not fully established yet.,,,
25235,,You must be tough and smart.,,,
6119,,"And this is your plan, John.",,,
9067,,"Mr. Movers, President Carter was not right a few weeks ago when he said that the American people were confronted with only two choices, with only two men, and with only two parties.",,,
32810,,Devastating what's happening to our inner cities.,,,
29772,,"There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective.",,,
27492,,"There is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established.",,,
19151,,We go back and look at the healthcare plan that he wanted to impose on the American people.,,,
8325,,And that's the fundamental reason why we can't let the farmer go by himself at the present time.,,,
10978,,We've got to give them the wherewithal to do it.,,,
18661,,Saddam Hussein would have been continually weakening.,,,
4216,,And that wasn't just about a problem between Georgia and Russia.,,,
18843,,"But I just know how this world works, and that in the councils of government, there must be certainty from the U.S. president.",,,
1584,,Employment ought to be restored to our people.,,,
24835,,You have to make tough calls.,,,
23894,,"So, if it's time for action, I think I have experience that counts.",,,
28896,,"No, I'm not proud of that.",,,
15774,,You just don't make unilateral cuts in the naive hope that the Soviets are going to behave themselves.,,,
34287,,"And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting.",,,
18026,,That's why they're fighting so vociferously.,,,
3496,,"But -- but let me -- let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that.",,,
17878,,I think we've given the American people back their spirit.,,,
23509,,"And the president's been very busy running around the country using what I just described to you as a reason to say I'm wishy-washy, that I'm a flip-flopper.",,,
6658,,"I've had shop stewards stand up and say, ""Will you promise me you're going to stop all this outsourcing?",,,
1425,,But now let's talk about the pluses that came out this week.,,,
4359,,And we can't do what Senator Obama wants to do.,,,
186,,But we've got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work.,,,
7978,,I don't think it was helpful when he suggested - and I'm glad he's corrected this to an extent - that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night in the United States.,,,
9283,,I was in coal country.,,,
16807,,It shows a lack of leadership.,,,
8056,,Some of them have been Democrats and some of them have been Republicans.,,,

13814,,Is the senior citizen better off because inflation is not wiping out their family's savings?,,,
17347,,My answer is that this campaign isn't over yet.,,,
19957,,"Go back to the time he was, what, Texas director for George McGovern.",,,
3325,,Again Governor Carter is inaccurate.,,,
5726,,I support clean coal technology.,,,
13752,,"And if they can't do it, if the Congress can't do it, let them then have to do it across the board.",,,
18429,,And I'll tell you exactly how.,,,
15416,,I've been President now for almost four years.,,,
2703,,"But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, ""I'll sit down,"" but you have to have a plan.",,,
14418,,But let's look at where I think the real mistake was made.,,,
6673,,They were told: Don't even bother; we're not going to listen to it.,,,
29894,,So I'm satisfied with it.,,,
24428,,"Certainly we care about the people, we care about the children, we care about the tragedy.",,,
153,,I would like a balanced budget amendment.,,,
8905,,"I think Government has a responsibility to find jobs for the youth of this country, and that the place to start is to assist in the very important and necessary task of helping cities rebuild.",,,
107,,"First, I've suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don't need and we can't afford.",,,
4114,,It doesn't mean that you invite them over for tea one day.,,,
8879,,"In addition to that, jobs programs to re-employ the youth in our cities would be very high on my priority list, both the Youth Opportunities Act of 1980 and a billion-dollar program that I would recommend to put youth to work in energy projects, in conservation projects, in projects that would carry out some of the great national goals of our country.",,,
18939,,"I'm going to do it in four years, and I'm going to immediately set out to have bilateral talks with North Korea.",,,
13597,,I propose an American version of what works in other countries -- I think we can do it better: invest and grow.,,,

22363,,"No, I think you'll see --",,,
33536,,She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever.,,,
241,,We can't simply stick our heads in the sands in terms of testing.,,,
4046,,But the important thing is -- the important thing is I visited Afghanistan and I traveled to Waziristan and I traveled to these places and I know what our security requirements are.,,,
6132,,"I'm going to give them $5,000 to take with them wherever they want to go, and this will give them affordability.",,,
19421,,"Again, well it's, you are very selective, Mr. President.",,,
15193,,"In addition to that, the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly.",,,
11976,,And I think that's the way it ought to be.,,,
25531,,But this administration time and time again has lost its way in this field.,,,
24142,,"Now, we can do better.",,,
6247,,"Just again, the example of the eloquence of Senator Obama.",,,
3770,,I want the families to make decisions between themselves and their doctors.,,,
22994,,"No, but he's for weakening it.",,,
21565,,I never thought I'd ever be involved in anything like this.,,,
15758,,But we cannot continue to live on a credit card.,,,
1250,,"Also I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care.",,,
18187,,And there's an enormous undone job to protect the loose nuclear materials in the world that are able to get to terrorists.,,,
17845,,"I asked: ""Are you better off than you were 4 years before?''",,,
11763,,I just want to make sure the return is good.,,,
13508,,"Well, I think there are many uh - tests, Mr. Drummond, of prestige.",,,
15785,,But there are many people who I admire in this country today.,,,
7631,,I think Kenne- Senator Kennedy is wrong on three counts.,,,
24471,,And there's a whole bunch of other things that I can't click off in this short period of time.,,,
24819,,And I'd like to thank those of you who are watching.,,,
16850,,"But uh - if - if you could just do away with the ones that are unfair, you could lower taxes for everyone.",,,
24198,,"Now, there are people in this room and people on this stage who've been in meetings when I would sit there and say, ""Is this the one we're going to talk about or do something about?""",,,
17130,,Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation.,,,
19695,,We have learned that you give him an inch he'll take a mile.,,,
34419,,I have a plan for doing that.,,,

27171,,But for us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong.,,,

29146,,"We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.",,,
24219,,"What I'm going to do is say to Jim Baker when this campaign is over, all right, let's sit down now, you do in domestic affairs what you've done in foreign affairs, be kind of the economic coordinator of all the domestic side of the House, and that includes all the economic side, all the training side, and bring this program together.",,,

12924,,"Well, Mr. Nixon, to go back to 1955.",,,
19499,,"Let's stop, you know, playing the political game, Mr. President.",,,
23995,,And so I just have a different approach.,,,
3974,,And it's going to be tough.,,,

9605,,It also means that we've got to make sure that young people like yourself are able to afford a college education.,,,

23778,,"Tonight I had a chance to discuss with you what to do to keep this economy going: keep the taxes low, don't increase the scope of the federal government, keep regulations down, legal reform, a health- care policy that does not empower the federal government but empowers individuals, and an energy plan that will help us become less dependent on foreign sources of energy.",,,

31977,,That was locker room talk.,,,
15125,,"I have no quarrel whatsoever with the things that have been done, because I believe it is high time that the civilized countries of the world made it plain that there is no room worldwide for terrorism; there will be no negotiation with terrorists of any kind.",,,

334,,I believe that that would help in terms of shelter.,,,

15714,,My Secretary of Defense is going to have to make a very difficult decision in which system to go forward with.,,,

29644,,I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you.,,,
2885,,"Well, I'm not gonna name my cabinet before I get elected.",,,
4045,,"By the way, when I'm subcommittee chairman, we take up the issues under my subcommittee.",,,
11446,,So I think that the idea of humility is an important one.,,,
19992,,"As far as I'm concerned, this is a campaign about issues.",,,
26116,,And these are things I think that will go a long way toward helping America build a stronger economy and a better tax system.,,,
15939,,I don't think we can turn over these kinds of decisions of the collective defense to the United Nations or anything else.,,,
11513,,This current administration's worked hard to keep the parties at the table.,,,
15246,,And let me add the word safety; it must be done with the utmost of safety.,,,
16245,,"So I think we can all share, with respect, in the fact that maybe the message is not getting out.",,,
27975,,And there are two very different paths the country can take.,,,
4001,,That's going to change when I'm president of the United States.,,,
8019,,We should come to its defense.,,,
19143,,I've worked hard to help families impart values to their own children.,,,

11001,,All I'm going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it.,,,
7810,,This is primarily an ideological battle - a battle for the minds and the hearts and the souls of men.,,,
22644,,He's trying to attack me.,,,
4110,,"And I'm glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy.",,,
16400,,And perhaps the biggest is world peace.,,,
8681,,"I believe that inflation today is caused by government simply spending more than government takes in, at the same time that government has imposed upon business and industry, from the shopkeeper on the corner to the biggest industrial plant in America, countless harassing regulations and punitive taxes that have reduced productivity at the same time they have increased the cost of production.",,,
28716,,"You know, some parents are worried about those filters, that you will have to ask your kids how to put them on there.",,,
653,,"Yes, I think it's fine to do business with them.",,,
32340,,How do you do that?,,,
6405,,"It is going to be requiring all of us -- Democrats, Republicans, independents -- to come together and to renew a spirit of sacrifice and service and responsibility.",,,
21588,,I'll be glad to take a shot at it.,,,
10095,,"And to suggest -- am I incorrect in that regard, on Sunday, the -- your secretary --",,,
19417,,And I hope we can do better.,,,
7193,,But let me go a step further.,,,
21342,,Let me just mention three things very quickly.,,,
17895,,Are we better of with this arms race?,,,
17286,,All history tells us that that's a mistake.,,,
1117,,I certainly hope it won't.,,,
17477,,"I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people.",,,
32298,,And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are.,,,
27524,,"Bob, let me just respond.",,,
14692,,"We've got a broad-based coalition that goes beyond party because I am going to change this country and make it better, with the help of the American people.",,,
19089,,"And thank you to the people of Hartford, our hosts.",,,
2442,,Because there -- there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis.,,,
19705,,Saddam is probably about as strong as he ever was.,,,
9937,,I was not the standard bearer.,,,
11330,,"I had a single mom and my grandparents raised me and it was because of the help of scholarships and my grandmother scrimping on things that she might have wanted to purchase and my mom, at one point, getting food stamps in order for us to put food on the table.",,,
28119,,I think price controls would hurt our ability to continue important research and development.,,,
24166,,No other nation would have cut defense as much as we already have without that.,,,
29375,,It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs.,,,
9040,,And I want to express my appreciation to the League of Women Voters for adopting a course with which I believe the great majority of Americans are in agreement.,,,
8601,,I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship.,,,
14508,,"Step one, if I get up there, we're going to clean that up.",,,
20115,,"Well, there he goes again, that line has been used before, I mean, exaggerating all the things that he did.",,,
27526,,This has been probably the biggest whopper that's been told during the course of this campaign.,,,
8581,,I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score.,,,
28492,,And that means keeping our military strong.,,,
14863,,"But in doing this, we have made sure that we address this question peacefully, not injecting American military forces into combat, but letting the strength of our nation be felt in a beneficial way.",,,
17482,,The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do.,,,
25058,,I'm not going to continue trying to respond to these repetitions of the falsehoods that have already been stated here.,,,
21036,,"We need somebody to simplify the code, to be fair, to continue prosperity by sharing some of the surplus with the people who pay the bills, particularly those at the bottom end of the economic ladder.",,,
4017,,"And I'll tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, ""Senator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son's name on it.""",,,
18455,,My opponent just said something amazing.,,,

18954,,"No, I don't think it's OK, and said so publicly.",,,
1302,,"And that's where there's been a great uh generation of despair, and ill health, and the lack of education, lack of purposefulness, and the lack of hope for the future.",,,
20936,,"Secondly, one of the things that we have to be careful about in politics is throwing money at a system that has not yet been reformed.",,,
26799,,It's about selecting a president of the United States.,,,
21460,,"Now I've come out with a new agenda for America's renewal, a plan that I believe really will help stimulate the growth of this economy.",,,
29263,,"So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.",,,
16666,,I don't know where that money would come from.,,,
17139,,"These people depend upon all of us for the little security that they have, and I'm not going to do it that way.",,,
7466,,"O'Neill said, ""Come on over.",,,
28294,,I mentioned before that the local communities are having a harder time passing bond issues.,,,

29382,,"I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.",,,
8894,,And I heard them ask just for something that would give them hope.,,,
30298,,"So you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal?",,,
30243,,"It's a good one, though.",,,
12816,,I've reached the conclusion that the Soviet Union is actually filibustering.,,,
7953,,I think it may be necessary that we have more taxes.,,,

8606,,I think it's a very clear contrast.,,,
813,,"He can have another ten seconds if he wants, Jim.",,,
27519,,"And the way to make sure they understand that is by having, from the very beginning, the tightest sanctions possible.",,,
12834,,But let's look at the other side of the coin.,,,
19419,,"I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn't dangerous and won't kill them and won't destroy their lives, get the message and change.",,,
33417,,We will not have open borders.,,,

20384,,That's totally false for him to stand up here and say that.,,,
25254,,What does the President have to say about taking responsibility for a Vice President who won't apologize for something like that?,,,
14662,,And we're going to lead the way out of this economic recession across this world and economic slowdown here at home.,,,

31911,,"I've said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said.",,,

556,,Of course that's a charge that's always made against any governor who runs for the presidency.,,,

12939,,Not as part of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores.,,,
29631,,"It would be squandered, too, believe me.",,,
6349,,"And I've got to tell you that vouchers, where they are requested and where they are agreed to, are a good and workable system.",,,
2555,,And so what I've tried to do as president is to apply those same principles.,,,
6315,,"And if we're going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it.",,,
8184,,But when we look at the growth of G.N.P.,,,

9454,,No tax on your savings.,,,
23304,,You looked at me like my clock was up.,,,
13543,,"Thi- Certainly we have been speaking, I know, of whether we should have retreat or defeat.",,,
18882,,And I've never wavered in my life.,,,
7871,,"I think in many ways this election is more important than any since 1932, or certainly almost any in this century.",,,
4090,,Now here's what we need to do.,,,
11932,,And that's what's gonna happen in the State of Texas.,,,
3182,,Now let me correct one other comment that uh - Governor Carter has made.,,,
28464,,"Now, what can I bring to that challenge?",,,
847,,"Do you know who J. Danforth was, he was a man who gave his life in World War II, so ridiculing a person's name is a little beneath this process.",,,
18257,,And they both looked at me and said: We need you.,,,
13228,,I'll just have to tell Mr. Morton that.,,,
26387,,So we talk about all these new jobs.,,,
20071,,I'd like the American people to know that I have worked very hard to be on their side.,,,
27173,,"Unfortunately, the economy is not stronger.",,,
20022,,He's arranged for me to spend a lot more time with Senator D'Amato in the last couple years so I'm more familiar with his comments than I used to be.,,,
11323,,"My wife, Michelle, is there and she could give you a much longer list than I do.",,,
32562,,Why didn't she do something about it?,,,
5553,,"What I've said is I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of working Americans, 95 percent.",,,
7903,,"The President is still going to be president for the next four months and he, of course, is the only one who could commit this country in this period.",,,
13927,,We cannot lose those jobs.,,,
10098,,The ambassador of the United Nations went on the Sunday television shows and spoke about how --,,,
32377,,And it shouldn't be allowed to happen.,,,
15763,,Can we start the clock over?,,,
16134,,So that's not where we ought to go.,,,
13105,,"Von Fremd, it would be completely irresponsible for a candidate for the presidency, or for a president himself, to indicate the course of action and the weapons he would use in the event of such an attack.",,,
2619,,And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they're setting up their training programs...,,,
2818,,Let me take just one question that he raises - the military strength and capability of the United States.,,,
16385,,"Thank you, and God bless you.",,,
21454,,"Well, in the first place, I believe that character is a part of being president.",,,
16574,,There's a difference in my opinion - uh and in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court and accordance with the definition in the dictionary.,,,
3512,,And there are folks out there who've been struggling before this crisis took place.,,,
2947,,It seems to me that we can go from there to uh - the uh - grain sales.,,,
14648,,It doesn't work that way when you're president.,,,
15555,,And so what I want to do is keep this expansion going.,,,
6269,,"I think it's going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in math and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability.",,,
7627,,I believe we should have a stronger military force.,,,
2492,,"Well, actually Governor, that isn't what your plan does.",,,
14675,,"So I am still focussed on gridlock, I guess.",,,
10631,,And so let's look at our records as well as our rhetoric.,,,
15642,,"And I think we know what they are: a good strong future, a future in which there is opportunity for all of our citizens.",,,
21205,,"I think we need to have an attorney general that says if a law is broken, we'll enforce it.",,,
16315,,"This sounds like real progress here, because we've had a big difference on the safe use of nuclear power for our energy base.",,,
29366,,We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.,,,
27152,,"They want jobs, they want to be able to make sure their kids are going to a good school.",,,
8310,,In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance.,,,
12998,,America has not been standing still.,,,
598,,And all of those things happened because the Philippines do crave democracy.,,,
21836,,"She asked a question, I think, is whether the health care profession was to blame.",,,
17010,,We need a president who can go in - who derives his strength from the people.,,,
12768,,I really don't need uh - Mr. Nixon to tell me about what my responsibilities are as a citizen.,,,
13198,,But certainly we're not going to have peace by giving in and indicating in advance that we are not going to defend what has become a symbol of freedom.,,,
21934,,I want to think that they're going to be able to afford an education.,,,
28250,,"Now, I said there was a contrast.",,,
7711,,I would have hoped that it would have been possible to use marshals to do so.,,,
26266,,You guarantee they have a chance to prove they're competent.,,,
14750,,"Now, you got to stop letting these people tell you who to vote for, you got to stop letting these folks in the press tell you you're throwing your vote away -- you got to start using your own head.",,,
26817,,We ought to protect the American flag with a constitutional amendment.,,,
7488,,They surely don't let me do that.,,,
28960,,So this is a show me state.,,,
10713,,I believe that we have to eliminate the earmarks.,,,
967,,With decent and affordable healthcare for all working families.,,,
6168,,I think that decisions should rest in the hands of the states.,,,
1559,,Thank you Barbara (barely audible).,,,
31963,,She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign...,,,
8279,,"Well, I would say in the latter that the - and that's what I found uh - somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures uh - Mr. Nixon, that you used in your previous speech, when you talked about the Truman Administration.",,,
20723,,Why haven't they done it in seven years?,,,
11742,,I think that it's in better shape now than he generally does.,,,
1283,,"Uh - what we're doing is saying that there are opportunities, business opportunities, educational opportunities, responsibilities uh - where people with talent, black or any other minority, can fully qualify.",,,
25630,,"And with that thought, I realized what a job I had with that letter.",,,
25387,,"And any research or development along the Star Wars schemes would inevitably involve our most advanced computers, our most advanced engineering.",,,
9904,,And we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship.,,,
3356,,This election will also determine what kind of world we leave our children.,,,
19988,,"Well, my blood pressure is lower, my weight, my cholesterol, but I will not make health an issue in this campaign.",,,
3644,,"But it's an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off we're going to be.",,,
1657,,"And so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people.",,,
11356,,I know what it's like in dark times.,,,
2730,,"Thank you, Jim, and Mr. President.",,,
17669,,"I was talking about the things that have been accomplished, and that was referring to the revival of patriotism and optimism, the new spirit that we're finding all over America.",,,
32076,,She didn't even know what that word -- what that letter meant.,,,
22621,,"And that was the serious, serious threat.",,,
24188,,Have a 3rd task force on new industries of the future to make sure we nail those for our country and they don't wind up in Europe and Asia.,,,
33173,,They will be protecting the Second Amendment.,,,
17780,,"Now, to -- I still -- I just have a minute here?",,,
7032,,And now the tax code is more fair.,,,
34420,,And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions.,,,
17425,,"And so, my change had come earlier than that.",,,
6614,,Here's some help for you to go to a community college.,,,
17371,,I think the American people will draw their own conclusions.,,,
18846,,"Well, first of all, I appreciate enormously the personal comments the president just made.",,,
8494,,Sometimes we - we get the opinion that in getting programs through the House or the Senate it's purely a question of legislative finagling and all that sort of thing.,,,
20892,,Because it's the cornerstone of reform in the State of Texas.,,,
23850,,"I believe experience counts, but it's not everything.",,,
1015,,"overlapping, aren't those the real costs?",,,
12754,,Well let me make one thing clear.,,,
22313,,Just a fact clarification real quickly.,,,
26773,,And we're all proud of it.,,,
2112,,"And I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors -- Republican and Democrats -- said, please let us do that.",,,
20888,,"You may claim you've got mandatory testing but you don't, Mr. Vice President.",,,
18854,,I'm trying to put a leash on them.,,,
37,,But it's important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top.,,,
10884,,One last point I want to make on energy.,,,
15565,,And they know who appropriates the money.,,,
10472,,We've got to have a package of reforms and it has got to lead to reform prosperity and peace in the world.,,,
19930,,"Well, I think it's pretty liberal, I'll put that label on it.",,,
14845,,But what we've done is use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace.,,,
17390,,"I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons.",,,
8487,,"And I am convinced that the alternate proposals that I have, that the Republicans have in the field of health, in the field of education, in the field of welfare, because they are not extreme, because they will accomplish the end uh - without too great cost in dollars or in freedom, that they could get through the next Congress.",,,
9583,,"And I just described -- I just described to you, Mr. President -- I just described to you precisely how I'd do it which is with a single number that people can put -- and they can put they're -- they're deductions and credits...",,,
1770,,I'm going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal.,,,
4320,,But that doesn't mean that we don't have a long way to go.,,,
8169,,And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here.,,,
12328,,What are we going to tell our children?,,,
1492,,"I was in uh - thirty primaries in the spring, and uh - at first it was obvious that I didn't have any standing in the poll.",,,
16393,,Because I mean it when I say I want a kinder and gentler nation.,,,
9899,,And that's what we've done.,,,
133,,"When you cut capital gains, you put people to work.",,,
12559,,Again we turn to the past.,,,
23202,,"I come from the school of thought that says when people have more money in their pocket during economic times, it increases demand or investment.",,,
15404,,"Well, my last word is again to say this: We were talking about this very simple amendment and women's rights.",,,
32589,,"You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power.",,,
11029,,"But the fact is, America is the greatest force for good in the history of the world.",,,
14810,,I do know what he has said about mine.,,,
26538,,We need to deal with managed care.,,,
2915,,And I would also restore the involvement of the Congress.,,,
27523,,"We need to put the pressure on them as hard as we possibly can, because if we do that, we won't have to take the military action.",,,
19736,,So it's not that we always disagree.,,,
26787,,"We need to be disagreeing on ideas, honestly, and talking about the future.",,,
2412,,"Well, I did with my first statement.",,,
25989,,"Nobody should smoke, young or old, but particularly young people should not smoke, but my record is there.",,,
33630,,But they have to pay up.,,,
20931,,You don't test every year.,,,
17486,,"Now, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion.",,,
20326,,I believe we ought to give seniors more options.,,,
15892,,"And I said, what can we do about it.",,,
21426,,"If you want me to be your president, we're going to face our problems.",,,
33016,,We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.,,,
836,,I see a man who is young and I am putting my confidence in a whole generation of people that are in their 30Ãâ‚¬s and 40Ãâ‚¬s.,,,
25917,,"What I want the President to do, and I think he may have done it, his last statement, call for an unconditional end of the violence and have the parties keep on talking as they should talk and have a resolution.",,,
27573,,But let me -- let me come back -- we can come back.,,,
21178,,We need to say we each need to be responsible for what we do.,,,
6189,,But I certainly would not impose any litmus test.,,,
1346,,"of a crime a serious criminal offense, and that person is prosecuted, then, in my opinion, we are going after the person who uses the gun for the wrong reason.",,,
23316,,We've got all kinds of giveaways.,,,
15194,,"This attitude is extremely dangerous and belligerent in its tone, although it's said with a quiet voice.",,,
28753,,"They ought to have their voices heard, but they shouldn't have a big megaphone that drowns out the American people.",,,
30112,,"And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson.",,,
19474,,You talk about the Brady Bill.,,,
16006,,And there are several there's a good political reason because it's just about this time of year that the Democrats start saying the Republicans are going to take away your Social Security.,,,
9015,,I don't believe in Constitutional Amendments that would interfere with that.,,,
15109,,"The degree of unpopularity of a regime when the choice is total authoritarianism totalitarianism, I should say, in the alternative government, makes one wonder whether you are being helpful to the people.",,,
26909,,"But instead, we've seen in nation after nation, a number of disturbing events.",,,
8397,,And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession.,,,
31889,,I apologize to my family.,,,
17094,,"Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery.",,,
15668,,"But I have defined the issues and I am not going to let Governor Dukakis go through this election without explaining some of these very liberal position he's the one a liberal, traditional liberal a progressive liberal Democrat.",,,
20778,,There is a difference of opinion.,,,
26161,,"And if you have some of each -- and I have some age, some experience and some intelligence -- that adds up to wisdom.",,,
22331,,Look at all these women Senate candidates we have here.,,,
780,,You're judged by the entire record.,,,
24030,,And I don't want to do that.,,,
5564,,"You know, when Senator Obama ended up his conversation with Joe the plumber -- we need to spread the wealth around.",,,
22988,,And there's a lot of good people working hard.,,,
18138,,And you go visit some of those kids in the hospitals today who were maimed because they don't have the armament.,,,
28320,,What I want to do is to send flexibility and authority to the local folks so you can choose what to do with the money.,,,
3981,,And Pakistan is a very important element in this.,,,
26040,,We need to reform it.,,,
19045,,We will continue to stay on the offense.,,,
13683,,"I think everyone's paying too much, but I think this idea that you can go out and -- then he hits me for vetoing a tax bill.",,,
12878,,"Fourth, let me say that in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the great force on our side is the desire of people to be free.",,,
18987,,We could have bilateral talks with Kim Jong Il.,,,
12529,,"Now why were we successful, as our predecessors were not successful?",,,
28398,,So I want to do something about that.,,,
10052,,I think these -- these actions taken by a president and a leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even material significance in that you'd hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses.,,,
20425,,The only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home.,,,
13957,,I think free trade is going to expand our job opportunity.,,,
7942,,"So we have the problem of not only building our own uh - military strength and extending uh - our policies abroad, we have to do a job here at home.",,,
7960,,But it isn't going to be working that way.,,,
11666,,"But we can't be all things to all people in the world, Jim.",,,
7336,,"Now, let me just share something.",,,
12992,,He talks about the progress in the field of slum clearance and the like.,,,
15176,,"First of all, the Soviet Union if I have been critical of some of the previous agreements, it's because we've been out-negotiated for quite a long time.",,,
27093,,"Then it went to the Russians and said, let's see if you can do something.",,,
3800,,"I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said, we've got to change this strategy.",,,
9224,,"You can invest in a company, bankrupt it, lay off the workers, strip away their pensions, and you still make money.",,,
31900,,"But it's locker room talk, and it's one of those things.",,,
16089,,And I voted the same way that he did three months before in a national governors' conference.,,,
20363,,The federal government should take no more than a third of anybody's check.,,,
16839,,You can't hire a lobbyist uh out of unemployment compensation checks.,,,
16282,,Those are the kinds of priorities for national security and for foreign policy that I want to pursue Mr. Bush and I have major differences on these issues and I hope very much to be president and pursue them.,,,
20159,,"You're not going to have the opportunities; there are going to be more deficits, more drugs, more crime, and less confidence in the American people.",,,
18260,,"You know, the president's father did not go into Iraq, into Baghdad, beyond Basra.",,,
25807,,"In the next four years, I want to focus on the following things.",,,
20801,,He decides who the right people are.,,,
12650,,Mr. Nixon talks about our being the strongest country in the world.,,,
1714,,And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.,,,
12074,,She's worked on it longer than I have.,,,
6015,,The technology is there and we have to drill now.,,,
16152,,And we ought to expand our markets abroad.,,,
28270,,"But when we find children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach, instead of saying oh, this is okay in America just to shuffle poor kids through schools, there has to be a consequence.",,,
13481,,"Beyond that, as far as the gold supply is concerned, and as far as the movement of gold is concerned, uh - we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom.",,,
23410,,"Secondly, we're going to create a manufacturing jobs credit and a new jobs credit for people to be able to help hire and be more competitive here in America.",,,

13897,,And let me say this.,,,
6141,,That's what I'm all about.,,,
12797,,But I believe the effort should be made once more by who's ever elected president of the United States.,,,

10020,,I know these folks and I know their families.,,,
25190,,"Yes, this had to do with our disarmament talks.",,,
4313,,So we have a long way to go in our intelligence services.,,,
9317,,But that's not what you've done in the last four years.,,,

3901,,And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there.,,,
15259,,I just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a better job of producing the things that people need than government can.,,,
26375,,You can decide which of us you think are right.,,,
27468,,I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world.,,,
22303,,It ought to be tried.,,,
8891,,"And in my view, this is not the answer to the problem.",,,
22969,,And I'm going to put in place a better homeland security effort.,,,

33217,,"But there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms.",,,
25165,,"On the other things that you've just said about the terrorists, I'm tempted to ask you what you would do.",,,
22024,,"On the broad issue here, when you're trying to solve a problem, you get the best plans.",,,

25428,,"Now, if you're willing to join us in getting rid of all the nuclear weapons in the world, then we'll give you this one, so that we would both know that no one can cheat; that we're both got something that if anyone tries to cheat .",,,

24432,,It's a different world now.,,,
25609,,America and Americans decide not just what's happening in this country.,,,
895,,But now we've got the lines too carefully drawn here.,,,
24564,,We have got to pull together.,,,
7863,,Now that's an issue between Mr. Nixon and myself.,,,
23745,,I respect him for that.,,,
768,,But the point is sometimes the action-,,,
26072,,Let me say that this is one of the most important issues in the world to me.,,,
22936,,"You cannot lead an alliance if you say, you know, you're going alone.",,,
12302,,And so -- on the logging issue.,,,
24679,,"-- because if the American people send me there, we'll get it done.",,,
1165,,"At that time, nobody thought I had a chance to win.",,,
18219,,Of course we're doing everything we can to protect America.,,,
16440,,"We'll never have uh - an end to the inflationary spiral, and we'll never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work.",,,
19781,,That's why my balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy.,,,
16496,,"On the other hand, uh when you have a bill of that magnitude, with - tho- those many provisions, a president has to sit and decide if there's more good than bad.",,,
19509,,"I have worked to support our country as the world's strongest force for peace and freedom, prosperity and security.",,,
1518,,We are not at war.,,,
62,,That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves.,,,
26320,,We're not going to touch Medicare.,,,
880,,"When the Vice President makes a decision, that will be his decision.",,,
6222,,I don't know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America.,,,
28722,,"I'll tell you this, I want to do something about this.",,,
6149,,"If you've got an employer-based health care plan, you keep it.",,,
2332,,"Sorry, but that's just not -- that's just not the facts.",,,
355,,And we've got to attend to them.,,,
7697,,"And then fourthly, as a moral leader.",,,
21314,,There will be a job-sucking sound going south.,,,
8903,,And why have they lost their industry?,,,
29800,,"I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other.",,,
22428,,"If in the next 5 minutes a television announcer came on and said, there is a major international crisis -- there is a major threat to the world or in this country a major threat -- my question is, who, if you were appointed to name 1 of the 3 of us, who would you choose?",,,
21647,,"I'm not a politician, but I think I could go to Washington in a week and get everybody holding hands and get this bill signed because I talk to the Democratic leaders and they want it.",,,
29653,,"Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.",,,
14245,,"Now, I think that's going back to where we started.",,,
26231,,"To me, Affirmative Action is making that extra effort.",,,
22145,,I'll close on this point.,,,
2962,,I don't believe that the Rumanians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.,,,
33756,,We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce.,,,
21195,,The time for campaign funding reform is after the election.,,,
16297,,This is another example of misplaced priorities.,,,
3712,,So we need to have fixed-cost contracts.,,,
29110,,"That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.",,,
21321,,We got to cut it out.,,,
10170,,"That's what we need more of, Candy.",,,
27970,,I want to see growing peace in this country.,,,
15119,,"Secondly, we all committed ourselves, as have all my predecessors in the Oval Office not to permit the spread of nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation, or to any other nation that does not presently have those weapons or capabilities for explosives.",,,
10497,,"I like Meg Whitman, she knows what it's like to be out there in the marketplace.",,,
3975,,But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas.,,,
11721,,Maybe I'm missing something here.,,,
13959,,"And it's free trade, fair trade that needs to be our hallmark, and we need more free trade agreements, not fewer.",,,
23642,,These are reasonable ways to help promote a culture of life in America.,,,
24426,,We cannot send our people all over the world to solve every problem that comes up.,,,
6295,,And we certainly need to adjust the certain loan eligibility to inflation.,,,
27668,,Then you have the military and then you have the civilian government.,,,
4028,,And it did and we will win this one and we won't come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail.,,,
8118,,"If we fail, then freedom fails.",,,
12997,,"Now the second point we have to understand is this, however.",,,
8527,,The major threat is external and will continue.,,,
13480,,This one must be stepped up.,,,
15639,,"The fact of the matter is that the next president of the United States is going to have to go to the White House seriously, he is going to have to work with the Congress seriously he can't turn to the Congress and blame them for the fact that we don't have a balanced budget and that we have billions and billions of dollars in red ink.",,,
10462,,You go to the heart of America's worries tonight.,,,
24532,,I am adamantly opposed to legalizing drugs.,,,
11398,,When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question.,,,
31982,,"If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.",,,
12614,,What are freedom's chances in those areas?,,,
7817,,To combat unemployment we first must concentrate on the very areas to which you refer - the so-called depressed areas.,,,
8386,,"Medical care for the aged, I would put under social security.",,,
6631,,I want you to notice how the president switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally.,,,
23069,,You know what he did?,,,
22809,,"I remember sitting in the White House looking at those generals, saying, ""Do you have what you need in this war?",,,
9147,,"And without a college level job, that's just unacceptable.",,,
27230,,Doing everything we can to control our own energy.,,,
29009,,Now let me come directly to your question.,,,
4244,,Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems.,,,
28816,,"Well, you establish respect for differences.",,,
31979,,"I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country.",,,
24237,,"But I think the important thing--the important thing-- is to use the powers the president does have on the assumption that, given the condition of this economy, we're going to keep interest rates down if we have the discipline to increase investment and reduce the debt at the same time.",,,
26409,,"Get the economy going, cut the capital gains rate, create more jobs and opportunities for everybody in America.",,,
26628,,Now none of that will happen anymore.,,,
13165,,It isn't a question of the number of people who are working in an Administration.,,,
30207,,"Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO.",,,
30276,,We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries.,,,
8066,,What's involved here is the question of leadership for the whole free world.,,,
19936,,I'm not even certain you were too excited about that.,,,
24585,,"I've tried to use the White House as a bully pulpit, speaking out against discrimination.",,,
6717,,That's not what we want.,,,
15731,,"Yes, we're going to have a strong and credible and effective nuclear deterrent.",,,
526,,One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance.,,,
20255,,That's not what I think.,,,
18250,,A free Iraq is essential for the security of this country.,,,
20597,,It means that the United States must have a strong diplomatic hand with our friends in NATO.,,,
16251,,"(Laughter, boos) That's my five seconds.",,,
16376,,They say we should be satisfied.,,,
10851,,"Look, we are in tough economic times; we all know that.",,,
12272,,"If you own the land, every day is Earth Day.",,,
12961,,"And then throughout the world appoint the best people we can get, ambassadors who can speak the language - no mere - not merely people who made a political contribution but who can speak the language.",,,
12572,,"Mr. Howe, Mr. Vice President.",,,
15688,,And that's the kind of America I want.,,,
20840,,"But, unfortunately, a lot of schools are trapping children in schools that just won't teach and won't change.",,,
29796,,"So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.",,,
24293,,We've got to help them.,,,
1042,,I think the American people are too.,,,
21049,,I'm not going to be the kind of president that says you get tax relief and you don't.,,,
19380,,That was certainly the case from the minute I got there.,,,
197,,But I just don't want to mandate it and risk putting this - setting the recovery back.,,,
138,,So that's one of the things that I think makes a big difference between us.,,,
17853,,"So far, it is only a beginning.",,,
24458,,"The best expression of my family values is that tonight's my 17th wedding anniversary, and I'd like to close my question by just wishing my wife a happy anniversary, and thank you, my daughter, for being here.",,,
14510,,"I'll have millions of people at my shoulder, shoulder to shoulder with me, and we will see it done work speed -- because it's wrong.",,,
12688,,"It would be an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to come in, to come into Latin America and to engage us in what would be a civil war, and possibly even worse than that.",,,
27917,,"I couldn't agree more about going forward, but I certainly don't want to go back to the policies of the last four years.",,,
24208,,It is the number one culprit.,,,
14592,,"Now, my problem is -- I heard what he said.",,,
12660,,I look up and see the Soviet flag on the moon.,,,
21636,,They ought to be engaged in making high speed rail.,,,
2669,,You've done a great job.,,,
27443,,"I think that would be a mistake, because when I've sent young men and women into harm's way, I always understand that that is the last resort, not the first resort.",,,
28190,,We share a common border with another nation.,,,
26904,,"And Mr. President, it's good to be with you again.",,,
10971,,Of course it's OK to go across state lines because in Arizona they may offer a better plan that suits you best than it does here in Tennessee.,,,
19468,,"In our administration, in my administration, we will expedite.",,,
13144,,"Then I believe that we should move full time on our missile production, particularly on Minuteman and on Polaris.",,,
2021,,And the reality is it's not just wealthy people -- you mentioned Donald Trump.,,,
22138,,I suggest now that our number one preoccupation is red ink and our country and we've got to put our people back to work so that we can afford to do these things we want to do in Russia.,,,
15801,,These are people that give of themselves everyday and every week and every month.,,,
20293,,But we're going to give you additional choices like they give federal employees in the federal employee health plan.,,,
28713,,And I'm so proud of what she accomplished in getting them on there.,,,
17265,,We have seen the barricades that have had to be built around the White House.,,,
17854,,"If the job were finished, I might have thought twice about seeking reelection for this job.",,,
22610,,"After 9/11, we had to look at the world differently.",,,
21610,,We go back to Washington and very difficult to get it through the Congress.,,,
15589,,There is no way of anticipating what may happen.,,,
4256,,"And, you know, I've got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that.",,,
19739,,"But it seemed to me just as an observer that you know before you'd call somebody to America, you'd have some notion what the end result might be.",,,
8077,,I'm sure he believes just as deeply that his will move that way.,,,
24601,,Coming from the political process.,,,
26389,,We're going to do that with a more aggressive trade policy.,,,
11401,,Having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nation's interests.,,,
12169,,Let me just tell you who the jury is.,,,
1697,,"Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America.",,,
34168,,"Now, why does that matter?",,,
2340,,Let me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank.,,,
20678,,"They said even if we are the strongest if we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do something if we don't have a clear vision of the military, if we don't stop extending our troops all around the world and nation building missions, then we're going to have a serious problem coming down the road, and I'm going to prevent that.",,,
9868,,I want it to be clearer.,,,
29147,,But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us.,,,
1536,,The American people had lost faith and trust and confidence in the presidency itself.,,,
111,,Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit.,,,
28180,,I don't want the federal government making decisions for consumers or for providers.,,,
1311,,I would not work hard to support any of those.,,,
2853,,We wanted to end the bloodshed in southern Africa.,,,
10953,,You really identified one of the really major challenges that America faces.,,,
13624,,It won't be painless but we've got to get the job done.,,,
11629,,"Some of them I've got a conflict of interest on, if you know what I mean.",,,
27044,,That will help us maintain the kind of American leadership that we need.,,,
15943,,And I think those that advocated the freeze missed the point that there was a better way and that better way has resulted in a principle asymmetrical cuts.,,,
29244,,And it has not been easy.,,,
2404,,"No, I think -- I had five seconds before you interrupted me, was ...",,,
5668,,That's not the way we cut -- we'll cut out all the pork.,,,
28875,,"Now, I hope people understand that Medicare today is important, but it doesn't keep up with the new medicines.",,,
25369,,"And if such a defense could be found, wouldn't it be far more humanitarian to say that now we can defend against a nuclear war by destroying missiles instead of slaughtering millions of people?",,,
19344,,So I believe that we should take a different approach to this and talk about how we stand on the issues instead of trying to characterize each other's motivations.,,,
6214,,Those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that.,,,
1348,,"That has not proven to be effective, and therefore, I think the better way is to go after the criminal, the individual who commits a crime in the possession of a gun and uses that gun for a part of his criminal activity.",,,
23823,,"This is the way the framers of the Constitution intended our government to be, a government that comes from the people.",,,
24134,,"I mean, we've got big economic problems, but we are not coming apart at the seams; we're ready for a recovery.",,,
19741,,Maybe that was the purpose.,,,
21476,,How would he feel about it?,,,
22915,,It hurts the middle class.,,,
16347,,His some of his college presidents aren't exactly holier than thou.,,,
23981,,I questioned his judgment and his character.,,,
11042,,There are some things I don't understand.,,,
14381,,"And then after the Republican dirty tricks group got through with me I'm another person, which I consider an absolutely sick operation.",,,
5772,,"I hope that Senator Obama will repudiate those remarks that were made by Congressman John Lewis, very unfair and totally inappropriate.",,,
3920,,That's what Admiral Mullen said.,,,
28559,,"And so, yeah, sometimes I agree with some of these groups in Washington and sometimes I don't.",,,
26577,,And talk about the economy.,,,
12891,,This should continue and it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that I can testify they have so deeply within them.,,,
27059,,We have made sure that they are isolated.,,,
23979,,"Well, let me--I have to correct one thing.",,,
28865,,"And if you have a -- if you have an elderly parent or grandparent who needs long-term care, then you will get help with that.",,,
25629,,"And I found myself wondering what it would be like for someone -- wondering if someone 100 years from now would be driving down that highway, and if they would see the same thing.",,,
29155,,That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.,,,
22109,,"And we're going to stay engaged, as long as I'm president, working to improve things.",,,
19647,,"I know you probably would oppose it, Mr. President, but I think we should have a fairer system and a flatter system, and we'll have a fairer and flatter system and we're going to make the economic package work.",,,
19491,,"So I'm glad I took on that fight and I believe, with all respect, I was right and he was wrong.",,,
20771,,Let me give you one example.,,,
15103,,"In the meantime, I'm going to continue praying that they'll carne home.",,,
915,,But I don't think there's anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future for rural communities and for rural America and at the same time working on Third World debt.,,,
28808,,"I think we can do that in a way that represents what America is all about, which is equal opportunity and an opportunity for people to realize their potential.",,,
2015,,Why don't I want to raise taxes on people?,,,
726,,He's got to get this thing more clear.,,,
538,,This is the problem I have with the big spending liberals.,,,
15559,,"And I don't want to do that, and I won't do that.",,,
945,,The best poverty program is a job with dignity in the private sector.,,,
461,,"And you see, yes, my position has evolved.",,,
33227,,"Well, let me just tell you before we go any further.",,,
24476,,At a very early age they learn how to learn.,,,
13936,,"I'd rather, if you gave me 2 bad choices --",,,
24997,,We simply are going to provide a deterrent so that it will be too costly for them if they are nursing any ideas of aggression against us.,,,
25596,,America is not temporary; we're forever.,,,
2799,,It's been one of secrecy and exclusion.,,,
31980,,"And certainly, I'm not proud of it.",,,
20993,,"On the international financial crises that come up, my friend, Bob Rubin, the former Secretary of Treasury is here, he's a close advisor to me and great friend in all respects.",,,
27334,,"By the way, number one I get rid of is Obamacare.",,,
30342,,And it's a big problem.,,,
22136,,We have to have our people at work.,,,
25551,,"And it seems to me that this could be an adjunct, or certainly a great assisting agent in getting that done.",,,
33503,,She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.,,,
16099,,We're going to tell you how to do it all.,,,
5983,,And this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face.,,,
1666,,But we all know that we've still got a lot of work to do.,,,
10998,,So let me -- let me just talk about this fundamental difference.,,,
11957,,I just happen to believe strongly that marriage is between a man and a woman.,,,
7459,,"""Fortunately, she didn't hold me to that deal.",,,
8043,,We should not uh - force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists.,,,
21765,,"And so I favor, strongly favor, term limits.",,,
21003,,I think the economy has meant more for the Gore and Clinton folks than the Gore and Clinton folks have meant for the economy.,,,

11822,,"One of my concerns, though, is I don't want to federalize the local police forces.",,,
15925,,"But I do think this, that the next president, even within a relatively stable budget and that's what we are going to have for the foreseeable future will have to make those tough choices that I was talking about and that Mr. Bush doesn't seem to want to make.",,,
16184,,"So I'll just keep saying, I am one.",,,
25181,,"[Laughter and applause] If I still have time, I might add, Mr. Trewhitt, I might add that it was Seneca or it was Cicero, I don't know which, that said, ""If it was not for the elders correcting the mistakes of the young, there would be no state.''",,,

16202,,I'm against the grain embargo; it was a mistake.,,,
1999,,"But in my view, the president should have grabbed it.",,,
25040,,He's 3 years into this administration.,,,
13259,,What I object to here is the constant reference to surrendering these islands.,,,
25584,,This evening we talked about national strength.,,,
3424,,I can't think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country.,,,
24755,,"Well, I don't have time in 30 seconds, or whatever -- a minute -- to talk about our health care reform plan.",,,
16520,,And uh - these projections have been very carefully made.,,,
19363,,But I want to touch on this is tobacco thing.,,,
629,,But you have to have a little bit of experience to know where to start.,,,
1004,,"Mr. Kraft, I believe that the American people, in the next four years under a Ford administration, will be called upon to make those necessary sacrifices to preserve the peace which we have.",,,
19552,,There will always be problems in this whole world.,,,
22928,,"Let me answer what he just said, about around the world.",,,
27467,,I would indict him for it.,,,
10203,,When -- when he was asked would class size...,,,
17369,,The President says it'll disappear automatically.,,,
26632,,"See, the first thing we have to do is get you a job.",,,
20492,,I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America.,,,
15047,,"But as governor, when I was at that end of the line and receiving some of these grants for Government programs, I saw that so many of them were dead-end.",,,
22272,,It is terrible to bus tiny little children across town.,,,
2920,,This is a responsibility of the president.,,,
17842,,"Well, we'll include it in that.",,,
12466,,"There's been too much finger pointing and too much name calling in Washington, D.C.",,,
6321,,And that is because they wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children.,,,
23221,,That's the way we leave it.,,,
307,,"And that's all I'm trying to do, is put it in focus.",,,
27958,,"Yes, I want to reduce our deficit by cutting spending that we don't need but also by asking the wealthy to do a little bit more so that we can invest in things like research and technology that are the key to a 21st century economy.",,,
21510,,So I think you're right and I hope the rest of the night belongs to you.,,,
4042,,"And when I'm president, I will.",,,
14404,,"I said well, this is simple.",,,
2737,,What kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children.,,,
21366,,If you don't grow the economy you can't get it done.,,,
4394,,And I've been proud of their support and their recognition of my service to the veterans.,,,
33327,,We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty.,,,
9022,,"But I don't think that the state, the Board of Regents, a Board of Education, or any state official, should try to compose that prayer for a child to recite.",,,
23996,,"I believe the way to get the deficit down is to control the growth of mandatory spending programs, and not raise taxes on the American people.",,,
22460,,And we have got to put our nation back to work.,,,
11573,,"Now, I did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier, and maybe I have heard, maybe I have heard the previous statements wrong, Governor.",,,
23452,,"I'm not going to, because that would be pandering.",,,
26821,,What I want the voters to do is to make a decision.,,,
14413,,"Whether it's Iran-contra, Iraq-gate or you name it, it's a steady stream.",,,
2022,,It's not just Donald Trump you're taxing.,,,
5583,,"But ultimately, we've got to pay for the core investments that make this economy strong and somebody's got to do it.",,,
6327,,"It had its flaws, it had its problems, the first time we had looked at the issue of education in America from a nationwide perspective.",,,
18375,,"I mean, we thought we'd whip more of them going in.",,,
1847,,"And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we're also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.",,,
7807,,This we must get across to the world.,,,
18550,,Now that's what we have to do.,,,
3305,,I don't know if that's exactly accurate or not.,,,
6478,,"Yes, we can be safe and secure, if we stay on the offense against the terrorists and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world.",,,
10735,,"We're going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling.",,,
8662,,The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend.,,,
1031,,"And I think that this uh - is one example where uh - a lot of people have selfish, grasping ideas now.",,,
4415,,"I guarantee you, as president of the United States, I know how to heal the wounds of war, I know how to deal with our adversaries, and I know how to deal with our friends.",,,
16736,,So mandatory conservation measures - yes.,,,
15526,,They don't like it when there's an unfair pounding and kind of hooting about people.,,,
15026,,It's very important to us that this be done with the full involvement of minority citizens.,,,
9645,,"Katherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it?",,,
16341,,"I hope I will do a good job as one who has had a relatively clean record with no conflicts of interest in his own public life, as has the Governor, to exhort young people to get into public service.",,,
28862,,"If you want to participate in some of the dynamic changes that are going on in our country, you will get specific help in doing that.",,,
27874,,...because the private sector's not going to invest in a...,,,
24139,,"But tell her it's not all that gloomy; we're the US, we faced tough problems before.",,,
34414,,"So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse.",,,
300,,Governor Thompson of Illinois did.,,,
6406,,I'm absolutely convinced we can do it.,,,
716,,Maybe he'll tell us where he stand on it tonight.,,,
25310,,"And despite the politics of it, I stand where I stand, and I think I'm right, and before this fight is over we're going to come up with a better bill, a more effective bill that does not undermine the liberties of our people.",,,
10771,,"I've got some news, Senator Obama, the news is bad.",,,
20237,,"I said that his tax cut plan, for example, raises the question of whether it's the right choice for the country.",,,
28055,,"It requires a different kind of leadership style to do it, though.",,,
26066,,It puts a heavy burden on a state like -- except for emergencies.,,,
18988,,And we can get those weapons at the same time as we get China.,,,
15686,,"I think this is a great country, because we've always wanted to do better, to make our country better, to make our lives better.",,,
18793,,"Number one, we can do this through the African Union, providing we give them the logistical support.",,,
28369,,I don't think that's the role of the president to pick you're right and you're not right.,,,
15811,,I think of Dr. Fauci.,,,
28194,,There needs to be more community health clinics where the poor can go get health care.,,,
8321,,I think this is the wrong direction.,,,
21794,,"If you put term limits in and don't reform government, you won't get the benefits you thought.",,,
582,,That is not the way you deal with the Soviets.,,,
12222,,The horse is up here now.,,,
13007,,"Now, looking at the other parts of the world - South America - talking about our record and the previous one.",,,
25814,,I have heard you say this time after time.,,,
8787,,And I think that's shocking; it's shameful.,,,
1877,,He's in the electronics business in -- in St. Louis.,,,
7792,,I think the United States can afford to do these things.,,,
23436,,He's talking about his plan to keep jobs here.,,,
8317,,I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.,,,
5948,,"But I do point out that he's been wrong on many foreign policy and national security issues, which is supposed to be his strength.",,,
32189,,It's going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.,,,
28760,,They look at Washington and see people pointing fingers and casting blame and saying one thing and doing another.,,,
23154,,It would ruin the quality of health care in America.,,,
16256,,"(Laughter, applause) Isn't that the point?",,,
24805,,That's Washington in a nutshell right there.,,,
1419,,And I don't think the record justifies the conclusion that you come to.,,,
15452,,"And if you answer all of those questions yes, why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for.",,,
26571,,I know it made a lot of difference many times in the Congress.,,,
20868,,I'm here with a group of 13 people from around the country who helped me prepare.,,,
22029,,Let's make sure this thing's as good as we all think it is at the end of the meeting.,,,
21854,,I think medical care should go with the person.,,,
10979,,"We can do it by giving them, as a start, a $5,000 refundable tax credit to go around and get the health insurance policy of their choice.",,,
4340,,That's going to be critical.,,,
22197,,"But they come to me and they say, please get the Congress to stop passing so many mandates telling us how to control things.",,,
16239,,"And not one thing did I see, with respect, on your network about my views on agriculture, and not one did I read in any newspaper.",,,
10507,,The key is making sure that the next treasury secretary understands that it's not enough just to help those at the top.,,,
28258,,"I think any time we end with one of these attacks, it's appropriate to respond.",,,
1502,,That's an overwhelming support from my own people who know me best.,,,
8498,,"Now, I also say that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, that, again, the question is not simply one of uh - a presidential veto stopping programs.",,,
30369,,You asked me a question.,,,
19556,,Then from World War I to World War II we had sort of a compulsory engagement policy.,,,
1175,,I think this should be indicative of the kind of leaders I would choose to help me if I am elected.,,,
17374,,"As the record develops, I think it's going to become increasingly clear that what I am saying and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go, and the comparison of approaches is such that I think will lead to further strength.",,,
5492,,"They're hurting, and they're angry.",,,
14992,,"I talked to a man just briefly there who asked me one simple question: ""Do I have reason to hope that I can someday take care of my family again?",,,
20070,,That's what this race is all about.,,,
22459,,"Now, finally, if you can't pay the bills you're dead in the water.",,,
10698,,And so we've got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that they're working for you.,,,
29595,,You learn a lot from financial disclosure.,,,
15573,,"Ann, the Vice President made that pledge.",,,
14470,,"Now, in 1984 they were told.",,,
11824,,"I believe in local control of governments, and obviously if they don't there needs to be a consequence at the federal level.",,,
26846,,"I want to talk about your responsibility, and your responsibility.",,,

22470,,But it's in your hands.,,,
238,,I notice that the Governor did not mention any testing.,,,
10737,,We're going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy.,,,
9967,,"You know, I -- I don't look at my pension.",,,
22144,,"Now, the other superpowers need to do their part.",,,
7985,,Now so that we get it absolutely clear: Senator Kennedy must as a candidate - as I as a candidate in fifty-two - criticize us when we're wrong.,,,
6099,,"You won't pay a fine, because...",,,
13119,,"And I say that those of us who stand against surrender of territory - this or any others - in the face of blackmail, in the s- face of force by the Communists are standing for the course that will lead to peace.",,,
17889,,That's what the economists tell us.,,,
28640,,I like the policies that will encourage farmers to put -- set aside land as well for conservation purposes.,,,
868,,"Well, John, I'm a man that's been a chief executive for ten years.",,,
6152,,And don't take my word for it.,,,
16948,,"But I do think we ought to have a cohesive economic policy with at - at least the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and the president's terms being uh - the same and letting the Congress, of course, be the third uh - entity with uh - with independence subject only to the president's veto.",,,
2222,,"If I don't like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company.",,,
12894,,I would just like to s- add this one point.,,,
19128,,And Jack Kemp and I want to share with you some ideas tonight.,,,
29225,,"And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck.",,,
3894,,"Jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer.",,,
8083,,It has stood for progress; it has stood for concern for the people's welfare.,,,
13021,,We're on the side of freedom.,,,
18470,,"As the politics change, his positions change.",,,
28870,,You're not going to be targeted in or targeted out.,,,
1843,,"Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth.",,,
28401,,"Look, this isn't about Governor Bush, it's not about me.",,,
24691,,"Ross, that's a great speech, but it's not quite that simple.",,,
25420,,It's putting a hair-trigger on nuclear war.,,,

5853,,"And it means that we can have tough, vigorous debates around issues.",,,
9422,,"Candy, it's not going to --",,,
15528,,And so I'm proud of my choice.,,,
15987,,The Congress is doing a better job of it.,,,
29319,,And I have done a lot...,,,
26943,,That's not the right course for us.,,,
26633,,And that's the economic package again.,,,
18725,,"And so I decided that a better way to approach the issue was to get other nations involved, just besides us.",,,
17128,,What that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade.,,,
19432,,This is a invasion of drugs from all over the world.,,,
26413,,"I don't break my promises after the election, and I don't make new promises in an election year.",,,
22191,,And the schools that are not chosen are improved -- competition does that.,,,
6602,,And guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap?,,,
2063,,And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas.,,,
12842,,"I cannot be more precise than that, because until we see what Mr. Khrushchev does and what he says uh - we cannot indicate what our plans will be.",,,
21315,,If the people send me to Washington the first thing I'll do is study that 2000-page agreement and make sure it's a 2-way street.,,,
12563,,But all this by itself is not enough.,,,

2618,,"When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now.",,,
243,,"And you got to be careful here, because there's a safety factor, but I think these things - and then also I am one who believes we've got to go the extra mile in clean - being sure that that blood supply is pure.",,,
21010,,"But you know, they were working pretty hard eight years ago.",,,
27236,,"We've got to do it in a responsible way by cutting out spending we don't need, but also asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more.",,,
2529,,One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way.,,,
22458,,And we will have so many people who are qualified for the top job that it will be terrific.,,,
14291,,"I think the woman that works with me, Rose Zamaria, is about as tough as a boot out there and makes some discipline and protects the taxpayer.",,,
11090,,I've been in them all my life.,,,
3690,,"We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off.",,,

24541,,"Secondly, we ought to have treatment on demand.",,,
22645,,He wants you to believe that I can't be president.,,,
18904,,And part of that leadership is sending the right message to places like North Korea.,,,
9735,,But the last point I want to make is this.,,,
12612,,"That's what should concern us, not the history of ten, or fifteen, or twenty years ago.",,,

9718,,My path is designed in getting small businesses to grow and hire people.,,,
