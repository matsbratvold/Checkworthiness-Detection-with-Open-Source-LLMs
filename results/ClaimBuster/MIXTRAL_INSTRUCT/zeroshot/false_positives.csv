12113,0,80.0,"If you allow -- also allow -- convince states to -- allow states to allow the mother to match some of the children's health insurance money with it, the pool purchasing power.","This statement is check-worthy because it contains a factual claim about a potential policy change that could affect the pool of money available for children's health insurance. The claim is not entirely clear, so it would require some investigation to determine the exact nature of the proposal and its potential impact.

However, the claim is somewhat vague and does not provide enough context for fact-checking. The claim about the relationship between passing strong legislation and the use of guns in the commission of a crime is also not well-defined and could be subject to interpretation."
21737,0,80.0,"On any program, and this includes crime, you'll find we have all kinds of great plans lying around that never get enacted into law and implemented.",This statement is check-worthy because it asserts the existence of 'great plans' for crime programs that have not been implemented.

2546,0,100.0,The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe.,"This is a factual claim that is subject to interpretation and debate. The federal government's role is defined by laws and regulations, and whether it is primarily responsible for keeping the American people safe is a matter of opinion. Additionally, the definition of'safety' is subjective and could encompass a wide range of issues, including national defense, healthcare, and environmental protection. As a result, this statement is check-worthy."
11772,0,80.0,"It's an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies, like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials, that's one of the worst forms of it.","The statement contains a factual claim about corruption in official agencies, which is a salient issue to the general public.

This is a claim that can be fact-checked using publicly available data on income inequality and wealth distribution."
17909,0,80.0,"These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price.","This statement is check-worthy because it asserts that certain laws are not being enforced, which could have a significant impact on public health and the environment.

The claim that the speaker, presumably a former US president, was able to ban chemical and biological weapons from the earth during their first term is both factual and salient to the general public. However, the statement is somewhat subjective in that it attributes the success of the ban to the speaker's actions, rather than the actions of multiple parties. Additionally, the statement is somewhat vague in that it does not specify which leaders of the Soviet Union and Europe were involved in the ban. Overall, I would rate the check-worthiness of this statement as 80 out of 100."
7247,0,80.0,And that is the result of this president taking his eye off of Osama bin Laden.,"This statement is check-worthy because it makes a factual claim about a specific action taken by the president. The claim is salient to the general public because it touches on the topic of national security and the War on Terror, which are both important issues. However, the statement is somewhat vague and does not provide enough context to fully evaluate its accuracy. Therefore, I have given it a score of 80."
12615,0,80.0,"By 1965 or 1970, will there be other Cubas in Latin America?","This statement is check-worthy because it makes a factual claim about the future, which can be verified by looking at historical trends and expert predictions.

However, the statement is somewhat subjective in its assessment of what would be 'in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria' and how it would 'help us with our fight against ISIS.' These aspects of the statement are not easily fact-checked and reduce the overall check-worthiness of the sentence."

The claim is that America is a country that's coming apart at the seams, which is a statement that could be fact-checked using publicly available information.

It is salient to the general public because it touches on the topic of presidential conduct and decision-making, which is a crucial aspect of the role of the president. This statement can be fact-checked by looking at the public statements made by presidential candidates and presidents regarding their proposed course of action and weapons use in the event of a military attack."

This is check-worthy because it involves a policy proposal that could have significant implications for the education system and the economy. However, the statement is somewhat subjective in its use of terms like 'critically important,' 'army,' 'higher pay,' and 'higher standards and accountability.' These terms could be interpreted in different ways, so I am deducting points for subjectivity. Additionally, the statement does not provide specific details about the proposal, such as the amount of the proposed pay raise or the nature of the proposed accountability measures. This lack of specificity also reduces the check-worthiness of the statement."
