The statement could be referring to a specific program or policy, but it does not provide enough context to determine this.

8726,1,80.0,"We have a coal supply that is equal to 50% of the world's coal supply, good for centuries, in this country.","The claim that the US has 50% of the world's coal supply is factual and can be checked using publicly available data.

This is a quantifiable fact that can be verified using publicly available data.
25136,1,90.0,"In a recent 30-day period, 37 terrorist acts in 20 countries have been committed.","This statement is check-worthy because it contains a factual claim about a specific number of terrorist acts in a defined time period and geographical area. The claim is salient to the general public due to the potential impact of terrorism on global security and stability. However, the statement does not provide enough context for fact-checking, such as the source of the information or the definition of a 'terrorist act'. Therefore, the score is not 100."

17644,1,80.0,"Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here.","This statement is check-worthy because it contains a factual claim about an increase in poverty rates. The claim is salient to the general public because poverty is a significant social issue.

7676,1,80.0,"About two percent of our population of white people are - is illiterate, ten per cent of our colored population.","The statement contains a factual claim about the literacy rates of different racial groups.

28462,1,80.0,Right now our military is the strongest in the entire history of the world.,"This statement is check-worthy because it is a factual claim about the military strength of the United States. While it is difficult to quantify military strength, there are various metrics such as military budget, number of troops, and military technology that can be used to fact-check this claim. However, the claim is somewhat subjective and depends on the definition of'strongest' and 'entire history', so I give it a score of 80 instead of 100."
3715,1,100.0,I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong.,"This statement is check-worthy because it is a factual claim about a specific action taken by a public figure that has a significant financial impact. The claim can be fact-checked by comparing the cost of the original contract to the revised contract, and determining whether the revision resulted in a savings of $6.8 billion. Additionally, the statement implies that the original contract was improper in some way, which could also be fact-checked by reviewing the terms of the contract and determining whether they were indeed problematic."
17129,1,80.0,This is the worst trade year in American history by far.,"This statement is check-worthy because it makes a factual claim about the worst trade year in American history. While it is subjective to some degree, it is still possible to fact-check this claim by looking at historical trade data and determining whether this year is indeed the worst. The statement is not a trivial factual claim, as it touches on economic history and potentially important issues such as international trade policy."
1851,1,70.0,"But under Governor Romney's definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses.","This statement is check-worthy because it makes a factual claim about the definition of a term ('millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses') used by a public figure (Governor Romney). While the term'small businesses' is somewhat subjective, the statement still references specific groups of people (millionaires and billionaires) and thus can be fact-checked using publicly available data on income and business ownership."
6926,1,80.0,"The Lewin report accurately noted that there are going to be 20 million people, over 20 million people added to government-controlled health care.","The statement is check-worthy because it makes a factual claim about the Lewin report and the number of people added to government-controlled health care. However, it is unclear what time frame the 20 million people are being added over, and what specific type of government-controlled health care is being referred to. This information would need to be clarified before fact-checking the statement."

While it is true that President Ford tried to pass the SALT treaty, it is not clear whether he was 'emphatically against' the treaty when he left office. This claim is check-worthy because it touches on historical information and can be fact-checked using publicly available sources."
30216,1,80.0,"I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.","The claim that the speaker voted for every sanction against Iran when they were in the Senate is factual and can be verified by checking the voting records of the Senate.

14087,1,80.0,Look what's happening to McDonnell Douglas; even Boeing is losing market share -- because we let the Europeans spend $25-$40 billion on Airbus without an appropriate competitive response.,"The statement contains a factual claim about the market share of McDonnell Douglas and Boeing, as well as the amount of money spent on Airbus. These are all quantifiable figures that can be fact-checked using publicly available information."
11645,1,100.0,"We did, actually, send troops into Rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures.","This is a factual claim that is check-worthy because it touches on a historical event. The Rwandan genocide is a well-known event, and the involvement of foreign troops in humanitarian relief efforts is a salient topic. This claim can be fact-checked using publicly available information about the Rwandan genocide and the international community's response."
12659,1,80.0,We've had the lowest rate of increase of economic growth in the last nine months of any major industrialized society in the world.,"This statement is check-worthy because it makes a factual claim about economic growth rates.

1440,1,80.0,"Since the depths of the recession, we have added four million jobs.","This statement is check-worthy because it contains a factual claim about the number of jobs added since the recession. The claim is salient to the general public because it relates to the economy and employment. However, the statement does not provide enough context to determine the exact time frame being referred to as 'the depths of the recession.' Therefore, the score is not 100."
24320,1,80.0,Our dollar's at an all time low against some foreign currencies.,"This statement is check-worthy because it contains a factual claim about the value of the US dollar compared to foreign currencies. This is salient to the general public because the value of currency can impact international trade and travel. The statement is not 100% check-worthy because it does not specify which foreign currencies it is being compared to, and it is possible that the dollar is only low against a few currencies, not all of them."
22305,1,80.0,"Not to the schools but to -- you know, 46% of the teachers in Chicago, public school teachers, send their kids to private school.",This statement is check-worthy because it contains a specific statistic about the percentage of Chicago public school teachers who send their children to private schools.

It would be possible to fact-check this statement by looking at historical employment data and comparing it to the presidencies of the past 72 years.

However, the reasoning behind the distribution of funds is not provided, which makes it less check-worthy. Additionally, the statement is somewhat vague about the services provided, but it is still a significant amount of money, so I would rate it as 80."
22642,1,90.0,He can't come here and tell you that he's left no child behind because he didn't fund no child left behind.,The claim 'he didn't fund no child left behind' is factual and salient to the general public.

However, the claim is not directly check-worthy as it lacks specific data or sources. The sentence also mentions families worried about bankruptcy, which is subjective and difficult to quantify."
16057,1,80.0,"I've appointed over 130, so I have a record.","The claim 'I've appointed over 130' is factual and can be verified by checking the number of appointments made by the person speaking.

It could be fact-checked by looking for evidence of a plot to kill Americans, such as statements from government officials or reports from reliable news sources."
21041,1,80.0,"It is 300,000 people smaller today than it was eight years ago.","This statement seems to be factual and quantifiable, making it check-worthy.

28583,1,80.0,"Federal government has gone down, Texas's government has gone up.",This statement is check-worthy because it contains factual claims about the size of the federal and Texas state governments.

The sentence also lacks context, making it difficult to assess the salience of the claim to the general public."
18137,1,90.0,"Humvees -- 10,000 out of 12,000 Humvees that are over there aren't armored.","The statement contains a factual claim about the number of armored Humvees, which is potentially check-worthy if the source of the number can be verified."
16000,1,70.0,It wasn't created as a welfare program.,"This statement is factual and could be check-worthy if it is referring to a specific program.

However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine the exact claim and whether it is check-worthy."
27176,1,80.0,This -- we have weakened our economy.,"This statement is check-worthy because it is factual and salient to the general public. The economy is a critical aspect of any society, and any claim about its strength or weakness is likely to be of interest to many people. However, the term 'weaken' is somewhat vague, so it would be necessary to define what exactly is meant by this term in order to fact-check the statement. For example, one might look at economic indicators such as GDP growth, unemployment rates, or inflation to determine whether the economy has indeed been weakened."

15242,1,80.0,"Our Government has, in the last year or so, taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were - well, they were public lands subject to multiple use - exploration for minerals and so forth.","The statement contains a factual claim about the government taking out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands. This is check-worthy because it is a significant action that could impact the public's access to natural resources and recreation. The reasoning for the score is that while the statement is factual, it is somewhat vague and does not provide specific details about the lands in question or the reasons for the change in status. This makes it less check-worthy than a more specific and detailed claim, but still worth fact-checking to confirm the accuracy of the statement and to provide more context for the public."

34165,1,80,And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.,"The sentence contains a factual claim about the number of sources that verify a statement made by Donald Trump. While the exact number of sources is not provided, the claim that there are 'dozens' of sources is still check-worthy as it implies a significant amount of evidence supporting the claim.

11566,1,70,When I was in the senate before I became vice president I was pushing for stronger action against Milosevic.,"This statement is check-worthy because it asserts that the speaker, who is not named but is likely Joe Biden based on context, pushed for stronger action against Milosevic while serving in the Senate. This claim is factual and pertains to a matter of public interest, namely international relations and conflict resolution. However, the statement is somewhat vague, as it does not specify what'stronger action' means or when exactly this occurred. Therefore, the score is not as high as it could be."
22036,1,80,"See, we've got a $4 trillion debt and only in America would you have $2.8 trillion of it or 70% of it financed 5 years or less.","The statement contains a factual claim about the US debt and its financing, which is salient to the general public.

It can be fact-checked by comparing the Senate Budget Committee report with Reagan's defense plans. The sentence also contains a subjective statement about the optimism of Reagan's figures, but this is not the main focus of the sentence and does not detract from its check-worthiness."
28317,1,80,The federal government puts about 6% of the money up.,"This statement seems factual and could be related to the budget of the federal government. However, it is unclear what the context is, so I cannot be 100% sure. For example, it could be referring to a specific program or initiative, but without more context, it is difficult to determine. Therefore, I am giving it a score of 80."
11070,1,90,Right now there's a peacekeeping force that has been set up and we have African Union troops in Darfur to stop a genocide that has killed hundreds of thousands of people.,The statement contains a factual claim about the existence of a peacekeeping force and African Union troops in Darfur. The claim is salient because it touches on a historical event (genocide) and mentions the number of people killed. The statement can be fact-checked by looking up the number of people killed in Darfur and checking if there is a peacekeeping force and African Union troops in Darfur.
22100,1,80,"Since I became president, 43, 44 countries have gone democratic, no longer totalitarian, no longer living under dictatorship or communist rule.","This statement is check-worthy because it makes a factual claim about the number of countries that have transitioned to democracy since a certain point in time.

The figure of $7 trillion to $8 trillion is check-worthy and would require fact-checking to verify its accuracy.
11850,1,0,A jury found them guilty.,"This sentence is not check-worthy because it does not contain any factual claims that are salient to the general public. It is a statement about a legal decision, but it does not provide any context or details about the case or the individuals involved.

10801,1,80,"And we provide a 50 percent tax credit so that they can buy health insurance for their workers, because there are an awful lot of small businesses that I meet across America that want to do right by their workers but they just can't afford it.","The statement contains a factual claim about the existence of a 50 percent tax credit for small businesses to buy health insurance for their workers. However, the statement is not entirely check-worthy because it does not specify the conditions for this tax credit.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is a reputable source of non-partisan analysis, and their projections about the effects of legislation are widely cited.

The claim that Senator Kennedy held up a bill for 100 days due to dissatisfaction with one provision is both specific and verifiable, making it a prime candidate for fact-checking. However, the statement is not a slam dunk for check-worthiness, as it does not provide enough context for the reader to fully understand the situation. For example, it does not specify which bill Senator Kennedy was holding up, or what the provision was that he took issue with. As a result, I have assigned it a score of 80, indicating that it is likely check-worthy but could benefit from additional context to help readers better understand the claim."

The claim is check-worthy because it is a statement about the potential economic impact of certain programs, which is a topic of public interest.

The statement is not trivial because it is a quantitative claim that is relevant to the public's understanding of the distribution of a certain resource.

The statement is not a trivial factual claim, as it involves a large number of FBI files and an action taken by someone in the White House.

It touches on a historical event and a topic of ongoing debate. The reasoning behind the score is that while the statement is factual, it is somewhat subjective in nature, as it implies that their goal was to create a 'government-run' system, which could be interpreted in different ways. Additionally, the use of the phrase 'and them' is somewhat vague and could use further clarification."

The statement can be fact-checked by looking up the text of the bill that President Reagan signed and comparing it to other state abortion laws that were in effect at the time.

As a result, it would be possible to fact-check this claim by gathering data on the types of weapons and equipment that are commonly carried by police officers in different parts of the country, and then comparing this information to data on the types of weapons that are commonly used by criminals in those same areas.

18338,1,50,"Plus, he says the cornerstone of his plan to succeed in Iraq is to call upon nations to serve.","The statement is somewhat check-worthy because it mentions a specific plan ('the cornerstone of his plan to succeed in Iraq') and a call to action ('to call upon nations to serve'). However, the claim is somewhat vague and lacks specific details, making it less check-worthy. Additionally, the term'succeed in Iraq' is subjective and could be interpreted in different ways, further reducing the check-worthiness of the statement."
12548,1,80,"First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have - if the should launch a surprise attack - we will be able to destroy their war-making capability.","The statement contains a factual claim about the US being the strongest nation militarily, but it also contains a subjective claim about the need to increase military strength. The factual claim is check-worthy, but the subjective claim is not. The score is 80 because the factual claim is more prominent in the sentence."
27954,1,80,"And I've put forward a plan to make sure that we're bringing manufacturing jobs back to our shores by rewarding companies and small businesses that are investing here, not overseas.","The claim that the speaker has put forward a plan to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US is check-worthy because it is factual and salient to the general public.

However, the statement is somewhat subjective in nature, as it implies that Senator Kennedy intentionally omitted this information and that the 25% figure is accurate. Therefore, I would give it a moderate check-worthiness score."
33867,1,0,"And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked.","The sentence is stating that the stories have been debunked, which implies that they are not factual. Since the sentence is talking about the non-factuality of other statements, it is not check-worthy."
26970,1,90,"You indicated that we shouldn't be passing nuclear treaties with Russia despite the fact that 71 senators, Democrats and Republicans, voted for it.",This statement is check-worthy because it contains a factual claim about the number of senators who voted for a nuclear treaty with Russia.

However, the statement is somewhat subjective in its use of the word 'oppose' and the phrase'some security.' It would be more check-worthy if it contained more specific language about the Administration and Mr. Nixon's stance on the issue."
1501,1,100,"In Georgia alone, for instance, I got 84 percent of the vote, and I think there were fourteen people uh - in addition to myself on the ballot, and Governor Wallace had been very strong in Georgia.","The sentence contains a specific, factual claim about the percentage of votes received in a particular state during an election, which is salient to the general public."

The number of troops is a verifiable fact, and the arms control agreement is a matter of public record. However, the claim that the Russian army has been cut and that this reduction is significant enough to warrant a reduction in US troops is more subjective and would require additional context to verify."
3688,1,80,"They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care.","This statement is check-worthy because it makes a factual claim about businesses going bankrupt due to healthcare costs.

1447,1,80,"Now we've had this pause, but most economists, regardless of their political philosophy, uh - indicate that this pause for a month or two was healthy, because we could not have honestly sustained a 9.2 percent rate of growth which we had in the first quarter of this year.","The claim that the US had a 9.2% rate of growth in the first quarter of this year is factual and can be verified using publicly available data. The statement that most economists, regardless of their political philosophy, indicate that a pause in growth was healthy is subjective and not easily verifiable, but it is related to a factual claim and is therefore somewhat check-worthy."

18334,1,80,My opponent says we didn't have any allies in this war.,"This statement is check-worthy because it is a factual claim that is subject to interpretation. The definition of an 'ally' can vary, and determining which countries were allies in a particular war can be a matter of opinion. Additionally, the statement refers to a specific war, which would need to be identified in order to fact-check the claim. Publicly available information, such as historical records and diplomatic documents, can be used to determine which countries were allies in a given war."

However, the source of the data is not provided, so the score is not 100."
8899,1,80,It seems to me that to deny the responsibility of the Federal Government to do something about our crumbling cities is to deny the opportunity for one thing: To 55% of the black population of our country that is locked within the inner cities of the metropolitan areas of our country.,The sentence contains a factual claim about the percentage of the black population living in inner cities. This is check-worthy because it is a statistic that is salient to the general public and can be fact-checked using publicly available information.

The statement does not provide enough context to fact-check without additional information, such as the identity of the two entities and the time period being referenced. However, it is likely that this information could be found through publicly available sources, making it check-worthy."
16543,1,80,"And at the same time, assuming that I sign the tax bill that was mentioned by Mr. Gannon, we will in the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers.","This statement is check-worthy because it asserts that the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers. The term 'wealthy taxpayers' is subjective, so it would be important to define this term in order to fact-check the claim.

While it is possible that the number 'almost 300' is accurate, it is also possible that it is an approximation or rounding of the actual number.

However, the score is reduced to 80 because the statement is somewhat vague about the nature of the commitment and the conditions under which it would be invoked, which may limit the ability to fact-check it with publicly available information."
11111,1,80,"What I've said is we're going to encourage democracy in Pakistan, expand our nonmilitary aid to Pakistan so that they have more of a stake in working with us, but insisting that they go after these militants.","The sentence contains a factual claim about the US's policy towards Pakistan, which is salient to the general public. However, the claim is not easily verifiable as it requires access to official documents or statements from the US government."
33375,1,70,Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.,"This statement is check-worthy because it attributes a specific stance to a public figure. While it may be difficult to definitively fact-check the statement due to the subjective nature of opinions and beliefs, it is still important to verify whether there is any evidence to support or refute the claim. This can be done by looking for statements made by Hillary Clinton herself or her official stance on border security during her political career."
24910,1,90,"And when a President doesn't know that submarine missiles are recallable, says that 70 percent of our strategic forces are conventional, discovers 3 years into his administration that our arms control efforts have failed because he didn't know that most Soviet missiles were on land -- these are things a President must know to command.","This statement is check-worthy because it makes specific claims about the knowledge and actions of a President. While the statement does not explicitly name the President, it is likely referring to President Trump, given the context. The claims made in this statement are factual and can be verified using publicly available information. For example, it can be checked whether President Trump made the statements about submarine missiles and strategic forces, and whether he discovered 3 years into his administration that our arms control efforts had failed. Additionally, it can be checked whether most Soviet missiles were on land during President Trump's administration. However, the statement does contain some subjective language, such as 'things a President must know to command', which is why the score is not 100."
24821,1,80,"I'd like to thank the computer executives and the electronics executives in Silicon Valley, two-thirds of whom are Republicans who said they wanted to sign on to a change in America.","The claim that two-thirds of computer and electronics executives in Silicon Valley are Republicans is potentially check-worthy. This is a factual claim that could be verified using publicly available data, such as political donation records or surveys. However, the claim is somewhat vague, as it does not specify a time frame or a clear definition of who counts as a 'computer or electronics executive.' Additionally, the source of the claim is not provided, which would need to be addressed in order to fully fact-check it."
26485,1,80,And that composite now is going to be built around the bridges on the Santa Monica Freeway to help minimize the impact of earthquakes and create more jobs.,"The statement contains a factual claim about the construction of a composite around the bridges on the Santa Monica Freeway to minimize the impact of earthquakes and create jobs. While it is possible that the construction of such a composite could help minimize the impact of earthquakes and create jobs, the sentence does not provide enough context or evidence to support these claims. Therefore, it is check-worthy to verify the accuracy of these claims using publicly available information."

However, the statement is somewhat vague and requires additional context to fact-check accurately."

However, the sentence does not provide enough context to fact-check the claims, such as a time frame or location. Therefore, the score is 90 instead of 100."

9243,1,80,We have increased oil production to the highest levels in 16 years.,"This statement is check-worthy because it contains a factual claim about oil production levels. While it is possible that the speaker is using the term 'oil production' in a non-standard way, it is likely that they are referring to a specific, measurable quantity. Therefore, it would be possible to fact-check this claim using publicly available data on oil production. However, the statement does not provide enough context to determine whether the increase in oil production is statistically significant or whether it is salient to the general public. As a result, I have given it a moderate check-worthiness score."
32998,1,90,She used the power of her office to make a lot of money.,This statement is check-worthy because it makes a factual claim about a public figure's financial dealings. It is salient to the general public because it touches on issues of corruption and ethics in government.

While the claim is not necessarily false, it is worth fact-checking to ensure that the sample of economists is representative and that the claim is not cherry-picked or misleading in any way."
8863,1,80,"We've got thousands and thousands of homes owned by government boarded up, being vandalized, that have been taken in mortgage foreclosures.","This statement is check-worthy because it contains a factual claim about the number of homes owned by the government that are being vandalized and taken in mortgage foreclosures. This claim is salient to the general public because it touches on issues of housing and government spending. However, the statement is somewhat vague, so it is not completely clear what the exact claim is that should be fact-checked. For example, it is not clear what time period the statement refers to or what constitutes a 'thousand' in this context. Additionally, it is not clear what is meant by 'vandalized' or 'taken in mortgage foreclosures'. Despite these issues, the statement is still check-worthy because it contains a factual claim that could be verified using publicly available information."

33992,1,80,So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire.,"This statement is check-worthy because it asserts a comparison between the federal income tax paid by undocumented immigrants and billionaires. While it is possible to find data on the amount of federal income tax paid by billionaires, determining the amount paid by undocumented immigrants would likely require more research, as they may not file tax returns or may use false social security numbers. Additionally, the statement implies that undocumented immigrants as a group pay more in federal income taxes than billionaires as a group, which is a broader claim that would require additional context and analysis to verify."
25214,1,80,"First, the Joint Chiefs of Staff went to the President, said, ""Don't put those troops there.''","This sentence is check-worthy because it mentions the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the President, both of whom are influential figures in the US government.

3097,1,90,The inflation rate under Kennedy and Johnson was about 2 percent - one-third what it is under this administration.,"This statement is check-worthy because it makes a factual claim about the inflation rate under two different presidential administrations.

However, the source of the data is not provided in the statement, which may affect the credibility of the claim. The score is therefore slightly reduced."
19157,1,100,"We had a BTU tax we turned into a $35 million gas tax, a $265 billion tax increase.",The statement contains a factual claim about a BTU tax being turned into a gas tax and a specific amount of tax increase.

28718,1,85,"And recently the Federal Trade Commission pointed out that some of these entertainment companies have warned parents that the material is inappropriate for children, and then they've turned around behind the backs of the parents and advertised that same adult material directly to children.","This statement contains a factual claim about the FTC's actions and the actions of entertainment companies. The claim is salient to the public because it touches on the issue of child protection and marketing practices.

While it is possible that some members of these groups do indeed perform multiple duties, the statement as written is somewhat vague and could be interpreted in different ways. For example, it is unclear whether 'double duties' refers to performing two jobs simultaneously, or to performing two separate jobs in sequence. It is also unclear whether this is a common or exceptional situation. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to fact-check this claim in order to provide more clarity and specificity."

This is check-worthy because it is a specific numerical claim that could be verified using publicly available trade data.
24495,1,80,"The use of cocaine, for example, by teenagers is dramatically down.","This statement is check-worthy because it is a factual claim about a specific statistic related to drug use, which is a topic of public interest.

21808,1,85,We have 35 million people without any insurance at all -- and I see them all the time.,"##### This item appears to be a factual claim, and it is salient to the general public. The claim is that there are 35 million people in the United States without health insurance. This is a significant number, and it is something that affects a large portion of the population. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as check-worthy, with a score of 85 out of 100. The reason for this score is that while the claim is factual and salient, it is not the most specific or precise claim that could be made. For example, it would be more check-worthy if the sentence specified the time period during which this number was true (e.g., ""as of 2021, we have 35 million people without any insurance at all""). Additionally, it would be more check-worthy if the sentence provided more context or details about the people who are uninsured (e.g., their age, income level, or reason for being uninsured). However, despite these limitations, the claim is still check-worthy and merits further investigation."

However, it is unclear whether the statement is entirely accurate, as it is possible that the speaker has been advocating for these incentives for longer than 3 quarters. Additionally, the statement is somewhat vague about the specifics of the incentives being discussed. Overall, the statement is check-worthy due to the presence of a quantifiable claim and the potential public interest in small business incentives."

The claim that the speaker, presumably a former US president, was able to ban chemical and biological weapons from the earth during their first term is both factual and salient to the general public. However, the statement is somewhat subjective in that it attributes the success of the ban to the speaker's actions, rather than the actions of multiple parties.

The claim is that the speaker will fix and make inner cities better for African-American citizens and Latinos/Hispanics.

This is a factual claim that could be verified by researching past elections and identifying cases where the outcome was determined by a single vote. However, the claim is somewhat vague, as it does not specify the type of election or the time frame in which these cases occurred. This reduces its check-worthiness slightly, but it is still a statement that could be of interest to the general public and is therefore worth fact-checking to some extent."
