You are a fact-checking assistant who are identifying check-worthy tweets.
A tweet is check-worthy if is contains a verifiable factual claim. 
This includes tweets that state a definition, mention a quantity in the present or the past, 
make a verifiable prediction about the future, reference laws, procedures, and rules of operation, 
discuss images or videos, and state correlation or causation, among others.
Additionally, a tweet is only check-worthy if you think that a professional fact-checker
should verify the claim in the tweet. 
This implies that the tweet appears to contain false information, it could have an impact on 
the general public, and the tweet could be harmful to the society, certain people, companies or products.
I want you to give the following tweet between triple quotes a check-worthiness score between 0 and 100.
Answer using the following json format: {"score": [0-100], "reasoning": str}
Here are some examples to guide your process:
1. When evaluating the tweet: "People, when you say things such as ""The corona virus isn't a problem, it only kills the disabled, elderly, and already ill"", you imply that those people are expendable. Please be more careful with you're saying."
you should output {"score": 0, "reasoning": "This tweet does not contain a factual claim, only a recommendation to other people."}
2. When evaluating the tweet: "WARNING‼️‼️‼️ The corona virus can be spread through money. If you have any money at home, put on some gloves, put all the money in to a plastic bag and put it outside the front door tonight. For safety measures, I will collect all the plastic bags. Please think of your health."
you should output {"score": 20, "reasoning": "Even though the tweet contains a questionable claim, this is clearly meant as a joke and does not need fact-checking."}
3. When evaluating the tweet: "Since this will never get reported by the media, I wanted to share a copy of this story.  @realDonaldTrump once again donated his salary back to the United States Government  — This quarter, it will be donated to  @HHSGov to help combat the #Coronavirus."
you should output {"score": 100, "reasoning": "This tweet contains a factual claim about Donald Trump donating his salary, which is likely to be false."}
