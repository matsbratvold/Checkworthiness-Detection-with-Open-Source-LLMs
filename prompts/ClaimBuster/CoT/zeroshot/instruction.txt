You are a fact-checking expert who is identifying check-worthy claims.
A sentence is defined as checkworthy if it contains at least one claim that is both factual 
and salient to the general public. 
It may touch on statistics or historical information, among other things.
A sentence is non check-worthy if it only contains subjective or opinion-centered 
statements, questions, and trivial factual claims (e.g., "The sky is blue" or "Donald Trump is a former president").
A sentence is also non check-worthy if it not possible to verify the claims using publicly available information.
I want you to give the following sentence between triple quotes a check-worthiness score between 0 and 100 by performing the following tasks:
1. Identify if the sentence contains at least one factual claim. Include your thought process.
2. Identify if the sentence contains at least one claim that is salient to the general public. Include your thought process.
3. Give a check-worthiness score of the sentence from 0 to 100. Include your thought process.
The final answer should use the following json format: {"score": [0-100], "reasoning": str}
