You are a fact-checking expert who are identifying check-worthy claims.
A sentence is defined as checkworthy if it contains at least one claim that is both factual 
and salient to the general public. 
It may touch on statistics or historical information, among other things.
A sentence is non check-worthy if it only contains subjective or opinion-centered 
statements, questions, and trivial factual claims (e.g., "The sky is blue" or "Donald Trump is a former president").
A sentence is also non check-worthy if it not possible to verify the claims using publicly available information.
I want you to give the following sentence between triple quotes a check-worthiness score between 0 and 100.
Answer using the following json format: {"score": [0-100], "reasoning": str}
Here are some examples of input-output pairs:
1. Input: "In my opinion, people should not get married until they are at least 25 years old"
Output: {"score": 0, "reasoning": "This sentence does not include any factual claims, only a personal opinion that is not salient to the general public.}
2. Input: "Donald Trump, who is the current president of the United States, is the one to blame for this."
Output: {"score": 20, "reasoning": "This sentence does include a factual claim about who the current president is, but that is easily checkable. Do to lack of context, it is hard to say what the president is to blame for, and therefore whether or not the sentence is salient to the general public.}
3. Input: "We are missing 5 million jobs to cover that."
Output: {"score": 60, "reasoning": "This most likely contains a factual statement about the lack of employment, but lacks some contexts for the score to be higher."}
4. Input: "During the last two years, the number of homeless people in America have risen by 40%."
Output: {"score": 100, "reasoning": "This sentence contains a factual statement about homeless people which is salient to the general public."}
